It comprises a surface area of 13,462 square kilometres (5,198 sq mi).[3] In 2010, the overall city's population was 120,447 and 56,802 live within the city core. There are around 356,000 people in the metropolitan area in 2020. Yushu is the fourth largest city in Qinghai.\n\nThe city seat is the town of Gyêgu (also known as Yushu and Jiegu in Chinese), built in the valley of the Batang River, a right tributary of the Tongtian, which becomes the Jinsha at their confluence. All of these makeups part of the Yangtze watershed. In fact, almost the entire area of Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is nomadic pastureland, except for Yushu city.\n\nYushu is one of the oldest towns in Qinghai,[citation needed] and has historically served as a major hub for regional trade.[4]: 116–117 It is situated at the crossroads of the important trade routes between Ya’an, Xining, and Lhasa.[citation needed] In the early days,[when?] Chinese traders brought tea bricks from Sichuan and transported them to other parts of the Tibetan regions such as Lhasa, Chamdo, and Golok, which were the best-known towns during that time.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the late 20th century, government officials encouraged traditionally nomadic merchants to settle down in Qinghai, including in Yushu, through measures such as low taxes and rents.[4]: 120 A 1995 research paper estimated that these merchants, which included many Hui traders of the Tibetan Plateau, comprised about one-third of Yushu's population.[4]: 120\n\nIn 2010, Yushu was severely impacted by an earthquake.[5] The earthquake destroyed many buildings in the city, and damaged many others.[5]\n\nWith an elevation of around 3,700 metres (12,100 ft), Yushu has an alpine subarctic climate (Köppen Dwc, Trewartha Eolo), with long, cold, very dry winters, and short, rainy, and mild summers. Average low temperatures are below freezing from early/mid-October to late April; however, due to the wide diurnal temperature variation, the average high never lowers to the freezing mark. Despite frequent rain during summer, when a majority of days sees rain, only June, the rainiest month, has less than 50% of possible sunshine; with monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 49% in June to 66% in November, the city receives 2,496 hours of bright sunshine annually. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −6.8 °C (19.8 °F) in January to 13.3 °C (55.9 °F) in July, while the annual mean is 3.75 °C (38.7 °F). About three-fourths of the annual precipitation of 482 mm (19.0 in) is delivered from June to September. The residents of Yushu City reported seeing a large meteor fireball falling from the sky into the horizon on December 23, 2020.[6]\n\nYushu comprises four subdistricts, two towns, and six townships.[10]\n\nDuring the late 20th century, government policy encouraged merchants throughout the region to settle down in Yushu.[4]: 120 A 1995 research paper estimated that these merchants, which included many Hui people, comprised about one-third of Yushu's population.[4]: 120\n\nThe city is served by the China National Highway 214 and the recently constructed (opened 2009) Yushu Batang Airport.\n\nThe city has a few monasteries in and around, it has also one mosque. Gyegu Monastery is located on the hill, while Thrangu Monastery and Domkar Monastery are located outside the city. There are also some famous religious sites such as the Wencheng Temple, the Gyanak Mani Stone Temple, and the King Gesar Museum. The Wencheng Temple is located 20 kilometers from the city center, while Gyanak Mani Temple is located 9 kilometers from the center. King Gesar Museum is located in the city center.\n\nThe city hosts a number of notable cultural festivals. Yushu is home to an annual horse racing festival, where Kham Tibetan warriors showcase their local culture.[12] The Yushu Horse Racing Festival is a traditional festival that is normally held at the end of July to the beginning of August, depending on the dates in the Tibetan calendar.[citation needed] The festival site is located on the lush summer grasslands of the valley floor, to make for better horse-racing events.[citation needed] Renowned as being the largest horse racing event in the Tibetan areas, the festival plays host to tens of thousands of Tibetans and tourists every year.[citation needed]\n\nThe festival features feats of horsemanship and horse racing that have been native to the plateau for over two thousand years, as well as horseback archery, tug-of-war, weightlifting, and many other local sports.[citation needed]New Faculty Q&A With Dr. Yushu Shi | Population Health Sciences: Dr. Yushu Shi is an assistant professor of population health sciences in the Division of Biostatistics. Before joining Weill Cornell Medicine, she was an assistant professor at the University of Missouri and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nTell us about your research. As an applied biostatistician, my primary research goal is to facilitate data processing and interpretation to answer high-impact scientific questions. During graduate school, I worked on nonparametric Bayesian methods and survival analysis. In my postdoctoral training, I developed statistical methods for microbiome research, including unsupervised clustering of microbiome samples and feature identification in supervised and unsupervised learning. Microbiome data is unique in high-dimensional and next-generational sequencing data and comes with phylogenetic information. In my work, I incorporate phylogenetic information in identifying features that drive clustering and determine outcomes.\n\nAt WCM, I am closer to leaders in the medical field than I’ve previously been, whether they are biologists, epidemiologists, or clinicians. Their input informs my work and allows me to better develop my research methods.\n\nIn both my graduate and postdoctoral training, I have served as a statistician for several clinical projects. With my statistical and computational background, I improve existing data analyses with robust and powerful quantitative approaches. I’m also experienced in and continuing to learn about emerging omics data structures and corresponding statistical analysis pipelines. These enable and enhance the quality of new scientific discoveries. In the era of big data, I enjoy collaborating with biomedical researchers and aim to answer real-world questions with statistical rigor.\n\nWhat brings you to Weill Cornell Medicine? Being at WCM offers the opportunity to work on clinically relevant problems and collaborate with leaders in the statistical and biomedical fields. The interdisciplinary environment facilitates diverse collaborations and innovative ideas. Partnerships with institutes like NewYork-Presbyterian, Rockefeller University, and the Sloan Kettering Institute allow me to keep up with cutting-edge technology and high-impact scientific questions. I’m motivated to develop novel statistical and computational tools that advance biomedical research.\n\nI’m also passionate about teaching Biostatistics II for the WCM graduate programs. Even when students are not on a statistics-focused track, I’m able to demonstrate how statistics can benefit their work. As an instructor, I have the opportunity to grow and improve with each course I teach while training the next generation of statisticians or data scientists. Are there any trends or issues you are currently following in your field?\n\nMy current research focuses on feature selection for high-dimensional data with false discovery control. I enjoy developing easy-to-use data visualization and manipulation tools, such as the R package and R Shiny apps. I am currently developing an R Shiny app that can visualize survival outcomes through a 2D contour plot and a tool for conducting conditional association tests for microbiome data with phylogenetic tree information. Given my prior experience, I’ve continued to work on microbiome data analysis and nonparametric Bayesian methods.\n\nIn the future, I’d like to develop an advanced course on feature selection. It’s a subject that would require students to have some established knowledge, and it’s not typically offered as an independent course. I think it’s a valuable one to expand upon, and I’m excited to explore its potential as an educator."}

The album that followed, Employment, changed our lives and has soundtracked the lives of millions of others since 2005. In 2025 we are saluting 20 years of that album and everyone is invited. Come celebrate the 2000’s, loving everything less & less and stripey blazers taking over the world. See you all next year.Kaiser Chiefs - Wikipedia: Kaiser Chiefs are an English indie rock[1][3] band from Leeds who originally formed in 1996 as Runston Parva, before reforming as Parva in 2000, and releasing one studio album, 22, in 2003, before renaming and establishing themselves in their current name that same year. Since their formation, the band has consisted of lead vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist Andrew \"Whitey\" White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist Nick \"Peanut\" Baines and since 2013 drummer Vijay Mistry, who replaced founding drummer Nick Hodgson following his departure from the band in late 2012.[4]\n\nPrimarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, the band has released eight original studio albums: Employment (2005), Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), Off with Their Heads (2008), The Future Is Medieval (2011), Education, Education, Education & War (2014), Stay Together (2016), Duck (2019), and Kaiser Chiefs' Easy Eighth Album (2024), one EP: Lap of Honour (2005), one compilation album: Souvenir: The Singles 2004–2012 (2012) and numerous singles, including the number one hit song \"Ruby\".\n\nTheir album Employment enjoyed critical and commercial success with over three million copies sold.[5] It has won the band three Brit Awards, including the award for Best British Group,[6] a NME award for Best Album,[7] and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.[8][9]\n\nTheir UK hit singles include 2004 and 2005 number 9 hit \"I Predict a Riot\", 2007 UK number 1 hit \"Ruby\", which has sold over 461,000 copies,[10] from their platinum album Yours Truly, Angry Mob plus a further two Top 20 singles in 2007 with \"The Angry Mob\" and \"Everything Is Average Nowadays\". Their singles \"Ruby\", \"I Predict a Riot\", \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\", \"Never Miss a Beat\" and \"Oh My God\" had sold a combined total of 1.1 million up to August 2012.[10]\n\nWhen they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire.[11] After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university.\n\nParva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and without any direction after the release of an album (22) and three singles (\"Heavy\", \"Good Bad Right Wrong\" and \"Hessles\").\n\nAccording to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \"No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them.\"[12] The band decided that they would aim for a longer-term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe.[13]\n\nManager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams, who persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: \"I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles.\" Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band.[12]\n\nIn July 2004, while still relatively unknown inside the UK, Kaiser Chiefs performed their first festival outside the UK at a festival in Moscow.[14] One of the major factors in the band's breakthrough in 2005 was their involvement in the NME Awards Tour at the beginning of the year.[15] Like Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand before them, their position as opening act proved an influential one, attracting a lot of positive media attention.[12]\n\nThe group's debut album Employment was released in March 2005, being primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s.[8] The album was well received by music critics, described as \"thrilling from beginning to end\" and \"quintessentially British, without pretension and most importantly, a whole lot of fun\".[16] It reached number two on the UK albums chart,[17] and was certified five times platinum.[18] In 2005, Employment was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year. Bookmakers made it favourite to win the award, but they eventually lost out to Antony and the Johnsons.[9] In 2006, Employment won the Ivor Novello award for 'Best Album'[19]\n\nThe first single released from the album was \"Oh My God\" in 2004, which reached number six on the UK singles chart when it was reissued in February 2005. In 2007, the song was covered by Mark Ronson and Lily Allen for Ronson's album Version. \"I Predict a Riot\" soon followed as the album's second release. In 2007, the song was ranked number thirty-six on the NME \"Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\" countdown.[20] The top twenty singles \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\" and \"Modern Way\" followed in late 2005. The band opened and performed several of their singles at the Philadelphia Live Eight concert in 2005. The song \"Saturday Night\" was featured in a pre-release video for the Xbox 360 gaming console. It was posted on the official Xbox 360 page before its launch.\n\nIn 2006, the band received NME awards for 'Best Album' for Employment and 'Best Dressed' for Ricky Wilson.[15]\n\nKaiser Chiefs' second album Yours Truly, Angry Mob was released in February 2007. The group recorded the album throughout the September and October 2006 at Hookend Recording Studios in Oxfordshire, England. The group took inspiration from Led Zeppelin and American rock music, and recorded over twenty-two songs.[21]\n\nYours Truly, Angry Mob reached number one on the UK albums chart and number forty-five on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[22] The album went on to be the band's second Million Seller including the UK and European #1 Airplay Hit of 2007 \"Ruby\".[23]\n\n\"Ruby\", the album's lead single, became Kaiser Chiefs' first UK number one single[24] and received the 2007 'Q Award' for 'Best Video'.[25] \"Everything Is Average Nowadays\" was released as the album's second single, and reached No. 19 in the UK.[26] The album's third single \"The Angry Mob\" peaked at number twenty-two in the UK.[27][28] The fourth single, \"Love's Not a Competition (But I'm Winning)\", was released on 12 November as a collector's edition 7\" only single via their website.\n\nIn December 2007, Kaiser Chiefs played two sold-out shows at Earl's Court in London[29] to a capacity crowd of 30,000.[30]\n\nOn 4 August 2008, the band confirmed the name of their third album as Off with Their Heads. It was released on 20 October 2008. The first single \"Never Miss a Beat\" was released on 6 October 2008.[31]\n\nThe band also released a DVD of their live performance at Elland Road from 24 May where they played to a sold out capacity crowd of 40,000 people.[32] The DVD contains the full set from the home of Leeds United as well as highlights from the Kaiser Chiefs performance for the 2007 BBC Electric Proms.\n\nKaiser Chiefs set out on a UK tour in October 2008 with Castle Donington band Late of the Pier and The Hair. The tour started at Leeds Academy, a new venue where they were the first headlining band to play. Other dates included Manchester Academy, Southampton Guildhall, Reading Rivermead, Glasgow Barrowlands, Leicester De Montfort Hall and London Forum.[citation needed]\n\nKaiser Chiefs headed out on a UK Arena tour between February and March 2009, kicking off in Nottingham and ending in London. The tour visited Sheffield, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Dublin. This was the new album tour to promote Off with Their Heads. The band featured on several shows over Christmas 2008 including performing \"Never Miss a Beat\" with Girls Aloud on their TV Special and playing the same song on the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, they played at Marés Vivas in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal as headliners on that day. They, along with Republic of Loose, opened for U2 in Croke Park in Dublin on 25 July 2009. They then opened for Green Day from 27 July to 7 August 2009, and the final shows before their 2-year hiatus were performed at Reading and Leeds Festival 2009.[33]\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Kaiser Chiefs announced that they expected to release their fourth studio album in mid-2011. The album was recorded over a period of eighteen months at various locations including drummer Nick Hodgson's self-built east-London studio.[34] The album's producers included Tony Visconti, Ethan Johns and Owen Morris, in addition to Nick Hodgson himself.[35] On 3 June 2011, Kaiser Chiefs launched their new album from their website. Using a create-your-own album technique, fans were able to choose 10 out of 20 songs to create \"their album\" for £7.50; the band provides streams of roughly one minute to preview each track before selection. Many celebrities including, Radio One DJ Chris Moyles, The Guardian Newspaper, and frontman Ricky Wilson, created their own version of the album, donating the £1 reimbursement for each copy sold to the Alzheimer's Society.[36]\n\nOn 27 June 2011, Kaiser Chiefs released an official track listing for the album, featuring 12 of the 20 available tracks and including a previously unheard track 'Kinda Girl You Are' which did not make the initial launch as it was not ready in time.[37] They played two sell out comeback gigs at Falmouth Princess Pavilion. Then followed by appearances at Germany's Hurricane and Southside Festivals in June, Switzerland's Gurten Festival, Pinkpop in The Netherlands, Belgium's Rock Werchter, Portuguese festival Optimus Alive! in July, V Festival in August, Hard Rock Calling in June, the Isle of Wight Festival in June and at Terres Rouges Festival in Luxembourg in September. They also played at Tennants Vital in Bangor, Northern Ireland and in September they played two sold-out home town shows at Kirkstall Abbey in Leeds. They also be played in October in Festa das Latas, Coimbra – Portugal.\n\nOn 6 March 2012 the album was re-released under the title Start The Revolution Without Me for the US market. The track list differs significantly from the initial release, including the track \"On The Run\", which is exclusive to the US album and served as its lead single in early 2012.[38]\n\nIn early 2012, Kaiser Chiefs played a 20 date tour of the United Kingdom, followed by a tour of North America.[38][39]\n\nKaiser Chiefs released their first compilation album, Souvenir: The Singles 2004–2012, in the UK on 4 June 2012. The album features all of the singles released by the band from 2004 to 2012, as well as a new track titled \"Listen to Your Head\".\n\nDrummer Nick Hodgson announced on 4 December 2012 that he had left the band to concentrate on other projects.[4][40] The band later issued a statement on their website confirming this.[41] On 7 February 2013 it was announced that Vijay Mistry from the band Club Smith would be joining the Kaiser Chiefs as their new drummer.[42]\n\nThe band were one of two support bands for Green Day's one-off concert at the Emirates Stadium in London on 1 June 2013 along with All Time Low. The band's UK tour included 13 shows, beginning at Carlisle Sands Centre on 11 February and ending at London's O2 Academy Brixton on 1 March. The run of shows also includes gigs in Glasgow, Dunfermline, Manchester, Bridlington, Newcastle, Preston, Cheltenham, Wolverhampton, Southampton, Margate and Cambridge. They then went on to headline one of the Eden Sessions at the Eden Project, Cornwall. They played a hometown concert at the First Direct Arena in September 2013, being one of the first artists to perform at the new venue.[43]\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, titled Education, Education, Education & War was released on 31 March 2014.[44] Education, Education, Education & War is the first album featuring the new Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Vijay Mistry, after Nick Hodgson left the group in December 2012.[45] The album was produced by Ben H. Allen III (who has previously worked with Gnarls Barkley, Animal Collective, and Deerhunter), and recorded at The Maze Studio in Atlanta. Three songs were co-written with Fraser T Smith (CeeLo Green, Adele).[46][47] It was mixed by Michael Brauer (My Morning Jacket, Coldplay) at Electric Lady Studios in New York City in November 2013.[48] On 5 December 2013, Kaiser Chiefs released a song titled \"Misery Company\" onto their SoundCloud account. The song had previously been performed live during the band's 2013 summer tour.[45][49] On 3 January 2014, \"Bows & Arrows\" premiered on Rolling Stone magazine's website.\n\nEducation, Education, Education & War was toured across Europe and the Americas throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn 2015, they supported the Foo Fighters during the South Africa, South America and Ireland legs of their Sonic Highways World Tour. They also released stand alone single 'Falling Awake' on 27 January 2015 via their YouTube channel.\n\nStay Together, the band's sixth studio album, was released on 7 October 2016. It was co-written and produced by Brian Higgins, whose production company Xenomania has worked with the likes of Girls Aloud and Pet Shop Boys. The album's name is a reference to the song \"We Stay Together\".[50][51] The first single from the album, \"Parachute\", was released on 14 June 2016. The second single, \"Hole In My Soul\" was released 18 August 2016 and the third and final single, \"We Stay Together\" was released on 9 December 2016.\n\nThis welcome return to the limelight saw ‘Stay Together’ push new boundaries to \"take this nondescript sound and stuff it impressively full of sing-a-long hooks, covering topics including monogamy (We Stay Together) and shagging (Good Clean Fun)\" as it marked an entirely new direction for the band, who went for a more dance-oriented sound.[52] While Education, Education, Education and War was more focused on politics and the perils of war, the Kaiser Chiefs made the album with a focus on love and relationships. Wilson elaborated further on the stark contrast between this last album and 'Stay Together': \"The thing about writing a protest album is it's straightforward. Only an idiot would disagree with you. You're just saying war is bad. But when you start talking about relationships like on this record it's harder because there's a lot more blurred line. There's no right or wrong.\"[53]\n\nThe band performed a string of best of forest shows in the summer of 2016 as part the Forestry Commission's Forest Live series. Stay Together was toured across Europe in early 2017.\n\nThe band signed with their original label Polydor Records for their seventh studio album, Duck, which released on 26 July 2019. For the album the band reunited with Ben H. Allen, the producer who worked on the band's 2014 album Education, Education, Education & War. The album was preceded by a UK tour in January and February, including concerts at London's O2 Academy Brixton and O2 Academy Birmingham, where several new songs from the album were premiered. The band also played a homecoming show at Elland Road in Leeds on 8 June 2019, which was also to celebrate 100 years of Leeds United.[54]\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Record Collection\", was released on 23 May 2019, with \"People Know How To Love One Another\" released as a second single on 6 June 2019. \"Golden Oldies\" was released as the third single in October 2019. The album entered at number three in the UK album charts.[55] Duck was later toured around arenas in the UK and Europe in early 2020, with all further touring cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn October 2022, the band announced the single \"How 2 Dance\", the first for V2 Records, which was released on 4 November. The song is part of their eighth album, Kaiser Chiefs' Easy Eighth Album,[56] produced by Nile Rodgers and Amir Amor.[57] The second single, \"Jealousy\", was released on 11 April 2023.[58] The third single, \"Feeling Alright\", was released on 25 October 2023.[59] The album was released on March 1, 2024.\n\nIn July 2005 they were chosen to open Bob Geldof's Live 8 festival in Philadelphia; their performance was broadcast by satellite to every Live 8 venue around the world, giving the band massive worldwide exposure.\n\nIn August 2006, the band released a book entitled A Record of Employment, which along with photos by Peter Hill, documented the band's rise from being unsigned to their triumph at the Brit Awards that year, where the band won awards for 'Best British Band', 'Best Rock Act' and 'Best New Artist'. Later a DVD entitled Enjoyment, which documented concerts from the first album era was released, this showed members of the band hypothetically interviewed when 'jaded rock stars'.\n\nIn October 2008, they also appeared on MTV Day, in Greece, along with bands like the (Greek) C-Real, R.E.M. and the singer Gabriella Cilmi.[60]\n\nDuring an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, David Letterman spoke to Nick Hodgson about buying the Kaiser Chiefs drum set after a brief discussion between the pair an undisclosed price was agreed. At the end of the Kaiser Chiefs show at Chicago's House of Blues (19 April 2012) Nick Hodgson announced this was the final show for his drum kit, which was to be sent to David Letterman.\n\nOn 12 August 2012, the band was featured in the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, playing \"Pinball Wizard\" by The Who.\n\nIn October 2014, Kaiser Chiefs played at The New Adelphi Club in Hull, East Yorkshire as headline act for the venue's 30th anniversary celebration.[61] A film capturing Kaiser Chiefs performance was made, which was shown at the Adelphi in January 2015 as part of Independent Music Venue Week. In October 2015, the film was screened at the 2015 Tucson Film & Music Festival in Arizona, United States.[62]\n\nThe band were the closing act for F1 Live (an event showcasing Formula 1 ahead of the 2017 British Grand Prix) held in Trafalgar Square, London on 12 July 2017, which was also broadcast live on Sky Sports.\n\nIn September 2022, Kaiser Chiefs headlined Pub in The Park in St Albans.[63]\n• Off with Their Heads (2008)\n• Off With Their Heads Tour (2008-2009)Kaiser Chiefs: Almost two decades in the game, and an extensive back-catalogue of stadium belters, instrumental-prowess, and record-breaking success, Kaiser Chiefs triumphantly return. Right off the back of a storm of note-worthy live-performances (including the Invictus Games opening ceremony, headlining Virgin Radio’s: One Big Thank You key worker show, and a televised performance for ITV’s Queen’s Jubilee celebrations), Kaiser Chiefs release their latest single: ‘How 2 Dance; the first taste of their forthcoming new album which promises to not only see us through the end of this year, but launch fans into 2023 with impeccable swagger, and heritage songwriting. “We really wanted to make a song that put together all the things we were trying to get right over the last three records”, notes frontman Ricky Wilson. “The call to arms of ‘Education, Education, Education and War’ (2014), the party atmosphere of ‘Stay Together’ (2016), and the classic Kaiser-yness of ‘Duck’. Where 2019’s ‘Duck’ straddled the tide between Northern-Soul euphoria and early ‘00s antithesis (in a statement of melancholic perfection), 2022 see’s Kaiser Chiefs stepping into a renewed spotlight; a hook-heightened universe in which Wilson (vocals), Andrew “Whitey” White (guitar), Simon Rix (bass), Keyboardist Peanut and Vijay Mistry on drums, come together to once again create what they craft best; breakthrough belters for the world’s dancefloor.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy."}

En ese país la incidencia de enfermedades cardiovasculares es mucho menor a comparación de otros países desarrollados, aunque siguen una dieta más rica en grasas saturadas.\n\nEl irlandés Samuel Black, observador y amante de la cultura y la buena mesa gala, publicó en 1819 un artículo científico en el que hizo la siguiente observación: «Los franceses comen una gran cantidad de grasas -quesos, otros derivados de la leche completa y foie gras- y en general tienen menos ataques al corazón que los ingleses y otros europeos». Al final del artículo Black dejó entrever que el consumo de vino tinto podía tener alguna participación en el asunto.\n\nHa habido varias interpretaciones del hecho. En 1991, un programa de televisión de la cadena estadounidense CBS (60 minutos) aseguró que se debía a las propiedades del vino tinto, y eso hizo que se dispararan las ventas de vino tinto en aquel país. Desde entonces este fenómeno se lo conoce como paradoja francesa.[1]​ Por su parte, Paul Bocuse lo explicaba por la gran calidad de los foies y las carnes que consumen, junto con el vino. Estudios recientes apuntan al efecto del consumo de aceite de oliva con alto contenido en ácido oleico y otros ingredientes típicos de la llamada dieta mediterránea.[2]​\n\nDe una parte parece claro que un consumo moderado de alcohol, especialmente de vino (que contiene resveratrol, polifenoles y flavonoides), es beneficioso para la salud [cita requerida], si bien los estudios más recientes concluyen que no hay relación entre el consumo de grasa saturada y las enfermedades cardiovasculares[3]​[4]​[5]​[6]​[7]​ y en todo caso podría ser al revés,[8]​ si bien otros factores podrían ser un aumento del consumo de vegetales y reducción del consumo de hidratos de carbono. Aparte de todo esto, se ha visto recientemente que el contenido de vitamina K2 MK-4 presente en los quesos franceses podría ser una de las explicaciones de esta paradoja.[9]​ [10]​\n\nLa idea de que las grasas saturadas son perjudiciales, se remontan a un estudio realizado en 1950 por Ancel Keys, que se ha demostrado intencionadamente falso.[11]​\n• El vino no siempre es perjudicial La paradoja francesa CONSUMER.ES\n• En defensa de las grasas\n• La falacia de la dieta mediterránea y la importancia del individuoNuevas explicaciones de la paradoja francesa: la metabolómica del queso | Sociedad Española de Dietética y Ciencias de la Alimentación (S.E.D.C.A.): En Madrid, los días 11 y 12 de marzo de 2025 tendrá lugar nuestro XVIII Congreso Internacional organ¿Qué hay de la paradoja francesa?: La denominada “paradoja francesa” es un término acuñado en los ochenta por tres hombres franceses para explicar un hallazgo peculiar. Si pones en un gráfico los casos de muerte causados por ataques del corazón y la cantidad de grasa saturada y colesterol que se consume en distintos países, pareces obtener a una línea recta. Cuantos más alimentos derivados de animales se consuman, más aumenta la tasa de mortalidad. En cambio, tal vez si logramos disminuir el consumo de carne, huevos y lácteos lo suficiente podríamos bajar las tasas de mortalidad por enfermedades coronarias a cero.\n\nComo dije en mi video ¿Cómo explicar la paradoja francesa?, dos países no se encontraban en la línea recta que mencioné. Finlandia parecía tener peores resultados de lo esperado, y Francia parecía tener mejores resultados de lo esperado. De ahí que se hable de la existencia de esta paradoja. ¿Cómo es posible que Francia tenga un consumo de grasa saturada y colesterol similar al de Finlandia, pero cinco veces menos ataques al corazón fatales?\n\nTodos tenían sus teorías favoritas para explicar la paradoja. ¿Era el vino? ¿Eran las cenas? Sí, los alimentos de origen animal estaban asociados con la mortalidad causada por enfermedades coronarias del corazón, pero los alimentos de origen vegetal parecían protectores. Así que, ¿tal vez el hecho de que los franceses comieran cuatro veces más vegetales ayuda a explicar sus bajas tasas de mortalidad?\n\nBueno, parece ser que no hay ninguna paradoja. Como Marion Nestle astutamente explicó, los franceses comenzaron a alimentarse de manera poco saludable muy recientemente y las enfermedades crónicas tardan décadas en desarrollarse. Los estadounidenses han estado comiendo así por más 40 años, mientras que los franceses apenas están empezando. Si todos comenzáramos a fumar hoy y no encontráramos un incremento significativo en el cáncer de pulmón mañana, eso no significaría que fumar no causa cáncer, solo que este necesita tiempo para desarrollarse.\n\n¿Qué pasa cuando se hacen los cálculos de verdad? Si se comparan la tasa de mortalidad por enfermedad coronaria contra la cantidad de grasa animal y los niveles de colesterol en esa época, se puede ver que Francia sí parecía estar excepcionalmente protegida. Y, si se comparan las tasas de mortalidad con lo que estaban comiendo dos décadas antes, siguen estando muy lejos de la línea recta. ¿Cómo es eso posible? Resulta que, de acuerdo a una investigación realizada por la Organización Mundial de la Salud, los doctores franceses registran hasta un 20% menos muertes causadas por enfermedades cardiacas isquémicas en los certificados de defunción de las que en realidad suceden.\n\nAsí que, teniendo esto en cuenta, Francia básicamente pasaría a situarse en la línea que relaciona la tasa de mortalidad con la grasa animal y el colesterol, con una tasa de ataques cardíacos fatales cuatro veces mayor que la de Japón décadas después de que aumentase cuatro veces el consumo de grasa animal.\n\nSi te estás haciendo preguntas sobre esos metaanálisis que muestran que la grasa saturada no está asociada con la enfermedad y pensaste que ya puedes comer mantequilla, lo has adivinado, tengo videos para ti: Los estudios de grasa saturada: ajustados para fallar y Estudios sobre grasa saturada: enmantecando al público.\n\n¿Y qué pasa con los estudios de la industria del huevo que afirman que el colesterol dietético es benigno?

Explica que las teorías más influyentes incluyen modelos de cambio de comportamiento, teoría del desarrollo de habilidades, teoría sociocognitiva, educación centrada en el alumno y modelo socioecológico. También analiza teorías de cambio de comportamiento como el modelo de creencias de salud y la teoría del comportamiento planificado, y cómo estas teorías pueden aplicarse para diseñar intervenciones nutricionales.Teorías y estrategias para el cambio de conducta en la alimentación: La atención de la salud y la nutrición están a la vanguardia de la medicina basada en la evidencia, demostrando que se puede medir la eficacia de las intervenciones nutricionales. El uso de bases teóricas para las intervenciones es clave para la comprensión y la medición de la eficacia. Se pueden hacer estudios controlados y aleatorizados en torno a las teorías que impulsan la selección de métodos de asesoría específicos o estrategias para lograr cambios muy personalizados. \n\n \n\n El asesoramiento nutricional es un proceso de apoyo para establecer prioridades y metas y crear planes de acción individualizados que reconocen y fomentan la responsabilidad del auto-cuidado. Los dietistas se ocupan a menudo del asesoramiento conductual relacionado con la nutrición, para facilitar el cambio de comportamiento. Para ser eficaces, los dietistas deberán tener conocimientos sobre la nutrición y las ciencias de la alimentación, la cocina étnicas y la cocinas regionales. Pueden proponer hipótesis y hacer ensayos controlados y aleatorizados y tienen experiencia práctica con la teoría basada en las estrategias para los cambios conductuales. Las teorías y los modelos validados dentro del campo de la dietética son un marco que ayuda a entender las cuestiones internas y externas y la dinámica que lleva a los cambios de conducta. El uso de estos marcos proporciona un fundamento para la selección de estrategias de asesoramiento específico para lograr un objetivo.\n\nLa teoría conductual y la teoría cognitivo-conductual (TCC) se basan en la suposición de que todo comportamiento es aprendido y que los factores ambientales e internos están relacionados con el comportamiento de cada uno. Las teorías apoyan las estrategias de auto-control y resolución de problemas, que hacen que las personas sean más concientes de los estímulos internos y externos y de sus respuestas. A las personas se les puede enseñar una variedad de estrategias para promover un cambio de comportamiento, incluyendo el auto-monitoreo, la resolución de problemas, la fijación de metas, el manejo de las contingencias, la reestructuración cognitiva, el apoyo social, el control de estímulos, el manejo del estrés y la prevención de las recaídas. El modelo transteórico describe el cambio de conducta en una serie de etapas y proporciona una base para el asesoramiento sobre estrategias correspondientes a las diferentes etapas del cambio. \n\n \n\n La teoría cognitiva social llama a construir la auto-eficacia (confianza en la propia capacidad para realizar una tarea específica), lo que influye en el esfuerzo que una persona está dispuesta a hacer para alcanzar un objetivo. Algunas de las estrategias cognitivas sociales aprobadas por la teoría son la imitación de los pares, el entrenamiento para desarrollar habilidades y el establecimiento de un conjunto de objetivos, los que refuerzan la autosuficiencia y la constancia de los esfuerzos por cambiar la conducta.\n\nEn el diseño y la aplicación de programas de asesoramiento nutricional como así de protocolos, el uso de teorías y modelos de cambio del comportamiento permiten a los dietistas aprovechar las estrategias aprobadas para mejorar la eficacia del asesoramiento. Las teorías del cambio de comportamiento constituyen el marco o fundamento para individualizar las intervenciones nutricionales de asesoramiento, para satisfacer las necesidades de las personas que tengan distintos grados de motivación, confianza, medio ambiente, apoyo y habilidades. \n\n \n\n La documentación regular del marco teórico y las estrategias utilizadas para el asesoramiento nutricional como parte del Proceso de Atención Nutricional, requerirá de los dietistas la aplicación de estrategias específicas para abordar los problemas de nutrición vinculados a los resultados específicos deseados. La adopción de registros o sistemas médicos electrónicos les permitirá evaluar los resultados del asesoramiento sobre diferentes estrategias para alcanzar los objetivos intermedios de tratamiento (por ej., aumento de la auto-eficacia o motivar al paciente para que pase de la precontemplación a la etapa de acción de cambio) y, definir las metas terapéuticas (por ej., pérdida de peso del 5% sostenida durante 1 año en todos los integrantes de la población atendida).\n\nEl proceso de incorporación de la atención nutricional centrado en el paciente incluye técnicas de asesoramiento para el cambio de comportamiento, que han demostrado ser efectivas para la prevención y el manejo de las enfermedades crónicas. Se ha demostrado que el asesoramiento nutricional brindado por dietistas mejora la pérdida de peso y su mantenimiento, la glucemia de los diabéticos tipo 2 y los factores de riesgo de enfermedad cardiovascular (ECV). Existe mucha evidencia que avala el uso de las TCC para facilitar los cambios de conducta destinados a reducir el riesgo de ECV, la prevención de la diabetes y la pérdida de peso. En la actualidad, hay evidencia relacionada con el uso del modelo transteórico en el contexto del cambio de la dieta. Esta teoría no solo ofrece estrategias apropiadas y validadas para favorecer el cambio de comportamiento, sino también permite la medición de los resultados principales (por ej., la disposición para el cambio de dieta), para evaluar el progreso de los pacientes no en las acciones de la etapa de cambio.\n\nLas construcciones, las variables y las estrategias relacionadas con la teoría cognitiva social (o teoría del aprendizaje social) se utilizan frecuentemente como parte de del asesoramiento dietético—por ej., demostraciones, capacitación de habilidades y testimonios. Se han validado muchas herramientas que miden el núcleo de las construcciones de esta teoría (por ej., la auto-eficacia y los resultados esperados) pero son pocos los estudios publicados sobre asesoramiento nutricional en este marco teórico. La obtención de más datos sobre esta teoría ayudará a determinar su valor potencial en la facilitación de los cambios de comportamiento relacionados con el marco.\n\nFinalmente, los autores expresan: “El uso rutinario y la documentación de las intervenciones basadas en la evidencia permitirán a los miembros de nuestra profesión a comprender mejor las complejidades del cambio de comportamiento nutricional y de las estrategias eficaces para ayudar a los pacientes a lograr los objetivos del cambio conductual.“\n\nDiversos grados de evidencia sostienen que el asesoramiento basado en la teoría produce cambios en materia de salud y alimentaria en adultos atendidos en un contexto ambulatorio o clínico.\n\n♦ Traducción y resumen objetivo: Dra.

He played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City, as well as the Scotland national team. He has since managed Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and Scotland.\n\nIn club football, Strachan played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and played in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.\n\nA right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982–83 European Cup Winners' Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup final in five seasons with Manchester United. He spent the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989–90 Second Division and 1991–92 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.\n\nStrachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the \"Saints\" to the 2003 FA Cup final, where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of Middlesbrough in the English Championship, but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.\n\nStrachan was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the 1990–91 season while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan and the grandfather of Luke Strachan, all of whom were also footballers.\n\nStrachan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1993 New Year Honours for services to association football.[4]\n\nBorn and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy.[5][6] His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery.[7] At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within \"a thousandth of an inch\" of permanently costing him the vision in his eye.[8] He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.[9]\n\nStrachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14.[9] In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United,[6] reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park.[9] His natural talent was immediately apparent, and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award.[6] He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975;[6] The Sunday Post compared him to a young Billy Bremner.[10] Strachan became a regular player in the 1975–76 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club's 36 league matches;[11] however, David White's \"Dee\" were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.[12]\n\nNew boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976–77 First Division campaign,[13] and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee.[6] Strachan considers his performance as captain as very poor. \"I was a pathetic Billy Bremner. I wanted to go about bumping into people, growling at people, shouting at people. And I forgot to be a footballer.\"[14] The club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first-team place early in the 1977–78 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was \"getting kicked a lot\" after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker.[15] Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that \"we need £50,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate\".[6][16] His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6–0 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as \"embarrassing\".\n\nStrachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of £50,000 plus Jim Shirra.[16] Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977–78 a poor season for Strachan, though the \"Dons\" went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers.[17] Strachan did win the Scottish 2nd XI Cup with the reserves in 1978.[18]\n\nMcNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager.[19] Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game's opening goal.[20] Though the 1978–79 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979–80 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park.[21] They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides en route, where they lost 3–0 to Dundee United at Dens Park.[22] At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year.[6][23] After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.[24]\n\nThe \"Reds\" could only manage a second-place finish in 1980–81, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become \"Britain's first £2 million player\", in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games.[25] He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach.[26] With fit-again Strachan on the right flank – supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy – and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981–82, but had to settle for second place to Celtic.[27] They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4–1 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.[28]\n\nThe 1982–83 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5–1 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup.[29] Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. The club's European success came with a 2–1 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1–0 win over Rangers.[30] The \"Dons\" continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983–84, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic.[31] This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.\n\nIn August 1984, Manchester United spent £500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford.[32] However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC Köln, United paid £75,000 compensation to resolve the row – teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany.[33] Strachan opened the 1984–85 campaign with four goals in seven matches,[34] though the \"Red Devils\" could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1–0 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.[35]\n\nAfter winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985–86 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury.[36] They proved unable to cope with their injuries – another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson – and limped to another fourth-place finish.[36] Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, \"I never thought he'd follow me this far south!\"[37] After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan's form.[38] United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986–87, before rising to second place in 1987–88. Strachan's form was again patchy in 1988–89, as United slipped back down to 11th.[39]\n\nIn March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of £200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club's history.[40] However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division.[41] He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles.[42] Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain's armband.[43] He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989–90.[44]\n\nWith the \"Whites\" now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed.[45] They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990–91, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup.[45] Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.[45]\n\nStrachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991–92.[46] In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds' hated rivals Manchester United the title.[47] However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back.[48] Following the club's success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.[49]\n\nHowever, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992–93 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League.[50] Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club's Player of the Year award.[50] He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993.[51] This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4–0 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.[52]\n\nStrachan managed 37 starts in 1993–94, and Leeds rose to fifth.[50] He was rarely selected in the 1994–95 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.[53]\n\nIn March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997.[54] Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson.[55] He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan's recommendation.[56] However, Isaías left the club after falling-out with Strachan.[57] Coventry signed Gary McAllister for £3 million on wages of £20,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister's former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal.[58] The club struggled at the start of the 1996–97 campaign, and the club's board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.[59]\n\nStrachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park.[60] Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm.[61] He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain.[62] The Scots cruised to a 5–2 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, Málaga; Strachan was named Man of the Match.[63] Scotland then lost 4–1 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamarín, Seville.[64] In the third match, a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union back in Málaga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.[64]\n\nScotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign.[65] To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg.[66] The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1–0 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualcóyotl to the unseeded – but highly fancied – Denmark.[67] Strachan then scored in a 2–1 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates.[68] In the third and final group match back in Nezahualcóyotl, Scotland drew 0–0 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when José Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.[68]\n\nStrachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup.[69] Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992.[70] However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles.[71] He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.\n\nWhen Ron Atkinson became Coventry City's director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to a player manager position. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant.[72] After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December.[73] However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the \"Sky Blues\" in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.[citation needed]\n\nStrachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan – all of whom would win international caps.[74] Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997–98, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997–98 FA Cup.[74] After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs.[75] Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.[citation needed]\n\nThe club finished 15th in 1998–99 and 14th in 1999–2000, as Strachan spent £6 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and £5 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa.[76] Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans.[77] New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool.[78] Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001–02 First Division campaign.[79] His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.[citation needed]\n\nStrachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager's job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary's Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan's appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002–03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.[80]\n\nIn February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press.[81] He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club's future following the leak.[82]\n\nAfter a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O'Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005–06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5–0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4–4 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4–0. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8–1, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan's first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association eight days later.[83]\n\nThe following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian's Derek Riordan; Chelsea's Jiří Jarošík; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost their round of 16 tie against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2–1 victory against Kilmarnock[84] left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. By April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1–0 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1–0 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2008–09 season, after winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, but failing to lead Celtic to another league title, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.[85][86]\n\nStrachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate.[87][88] He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager's job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player.[89] His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1–0 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty.[90] On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5–1 away to Queens Park Rangers.[91] After a poor run of results, including a 3–0 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1–0 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3–0.[92]\n\nAfter a poor start to the 2010–11 season meant Middlesbrough were in 20th place,[93] Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October.[94] He voluntarily ended his contract and left without compensation.[93]\n\nStrachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein.[95] His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1–0 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan's first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots' slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup.[96] After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia[96] and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.\n\nIn Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland.[96] After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland.[96] In their following match, Scotland produced an \"insipid\" performance, as they lost 1–0 in Georgia.[96] A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play.[96] In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany.[96] Scotland came from behind to lead 2–1 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive.[96] A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention.[96] Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck.[96] After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association.[97] After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.[98]\n\nTypically playing a traditional 4–4–2 formation,[99][100][101] and very occasionally 4–5–1,[99][102] Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style,[103][better source needed] and states that he watches video replays of his club's matches two or sometimes three times.[104] He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed.[105][106] Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.[107]\n\nRenowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.[108][109]\n\nDespite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan's managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, \"I decided this man could not be trusted an inch – I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.\" In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson's comments, Strachan said he was \"surprised and disappointed\".[110] The rivalry dates from Strachan's time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United.[111] In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson's Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.[112]\n\nStrachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport's Match of the Day 2.[113] He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV's coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV.[114] In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during The Debate on Sky Sports.[115] Following the release of convicted sex offender Adam Johnson from prison, Strachan had appeared to suggest that abusing Johnson for that offence was comparable with racial abuse.[115]\n\nFor the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children's Villages, the official charity of the tournament.[116]\n\nStrachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.[117]\n\nIn July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.[118]\n\nStrachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man.[119] Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers,[117] and Gemma Strachan.[120] Strachan's grandson, Luke, is also a footballer and came through the youth setup with Dundee whilst Gordon was technical director at the club.[121]\n• PFA Team of the Year Second Division: 1989–90\n• PFA Team of the Year First Division: 1990–91Gordon Strachan - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Gordon David Strachan /ˈɡɔrdən ˈdeɪvɪd ˈstrɑːxən/ (Edimburgo, Escocia, 9 de febrero de 1957) es un exfutbolista y entrenador escocés.

He was born June 7, 1929 in Cleveland, Oh, a son of the late Alexander William and Margaret (Watt) Strachan and was also preceded in death by his wife... View Obituary & Service InformationGordon C. Strachan (White House Special Files: Staff Member and Office Files) | Richard Nixon Museum and Library: Gordon C. Strachan, a California-born lawyer in Nixon's old New York law firm, came to Washington in August 1970 to join the Nixon White House staff. His former college classmate, Dwight L. Chapin, who was the President's appointments secretary, recruited Strachan for a White House position. Strachan was, however, already acquainted with several Nixon aides from his college days at the University of Southern California and from his intermittent advance work during the 1970 congressional campaigns.\n\nHis first assignment at the White House was staff assistant to Herbert G. Klein, Director of Communications for the Executive Branch. It seemed he was filling a vacancy on Klein's staff that was created by the departure of James Hogue. There is in Strachan's files two folders of what appear to be Hogue's chronological files for the period March-July 1970. Although Strachan was hired as a staff assistant to Klein, he worked primarily under the supervision of Jeb S. Magruder, deputy director of communications, who reported directly to Klein and White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman.\n\nStrachan's most important daily assignment was overseeing the liaison work with the public information officers at various departments and agencies. Strachan personally handled liaison with departments of Commerce and Labor, Office of Economic Opportunity, and Peace Corps. Although he had been initially assigned responsibilities with the offices of Emergency Preparedness, Army Corps of Engineers, Nixon's science adviser Lee A. DuBridge, and those promoting voluntary service, his file folders on these topics are empty. The liaison work required daily contact with the appropriate public information officers, and in some instances Strachan was expected to maintain morning and afternoon telephone contacts with particular departments and agencies. Strachan's handwritten notes indicate the extent of these daily contacts. He was also required to prepare weekly and monthly reports on the activities of his assigned departments and agencies.\n\nAlthough Strachan had functional duties as staff assistant in the communications office, he had been initially recruited to be what was called project manager. In his testimony before the Ervin Committee, Strachan described the specialized duties of a project manager. Specific issues of varying degrees of importance to the administration were assigned to one senior White House staffer and one junior staff member to devise the best strategy for communicating to the public various Presidential and administration activities or programs. For example, during the 1970 midterm elections the state of the economy became a major campaign issue. Strachan and White House speech writer William L. Safire were assigned to the economy issue as a project–Strachan as the junior staff assistant and Safire as the senior person. They reported to Haldeman through Magruder on the alleged high cost of congressional spending. The titles of the folders in Strachan's files indicate the topics of other projects on which he worked: Vietnam, State of the Union address, B-52 casualty figures, Honor America Day, SST, inflation, polling, the Indian occupation of Alcatraz, Presidential vetoes, political advertising, and selected legislation.\n\nAs a project manager, it was Strachan's responsibility to develop so-called game plans for a particular event or issue from all the ideas furnished by interested staffers or offices. The general format of these tentative plans included a description of the event or issue, the desired objective, and a proposed course of action. Strachan would thus outline the possible steps the administration might take in dealing with a particular event or issue, and then, using the game plan as a working document, prepare a follow-up memorandum based on his annotations to the original game plan. In addition to this, it was his responsibility as the project manager to make certain that the plan was carried out as agreed by Haldeman and other senior staffers.\n\nStrachan's files also revealed his involvement in the mailings operation which the communications office was becoming increasingly more active. Klein and his staff felt a need to improve the dissemination of information from the White House to the public, because they realized not every news organization could afford to maintain a correspondent in Washington nor belong to one of the major wire services. Consequently, the communications office began to mail out fact sheets or background materials on specific issues to editorial writers, publishers, news media directors, and other influential groups for their use. As the operation began to expand in size and scope, the staff realized that it could not be handled within the White House and so turned to the Republican National Committee (RNC) for assistance. To insure the proper coordination between the White House and RNC, Strachan was assigned the task of liaison. He made certain that the lists were periodically updated and that the most effective groups received a complete set of mail listings. Strachan was also instrumental in expanding the mailings list to include select groups of individual voters, such as blue-collar workers, educators, farmers, and various ethnic groups. Although the content of the mailings varied greatly, the objective remained always the same–to foster and mold public opinion in support of the President and his policies and programs.\n\nAn offshoot to the mailings operation was a letters-to-the-editor project. Under Magruder's guidance, a White House letter-writing campaign was established around single issues, such as law and order, media bias, welfare reform, campus violence, integration, select legistation, and political candidates. Since the RNC had the facilities and ample manpower to handle the details, it took on the job and supplied the writers and other support services for the White House. Strachan, acting as the White House Liaison, provided the proper supervisory coordination for the project.\n\nStrachan worked for Klein until after the 1970 elections. Once these elections were concluded, key senior White House staff members immediately began to turn their attention to planning for the 1972 Presidential campaign. An indication of this shift in outlook was a reshuffling of personnel within the White House staff, and Strachan was one of those Nixon aides affected. By March 1971 he was working as a staff assistant on Haldeman's staff, handling all projects in the political area. Although Strachan told the Ervin Committee he worked in Klein's shop until the end of December 1970, his chronological files as a staff assistant to Klein end at the beginning of March 1971.\n\nOther material related to Gordon Strachan are in Haldeman's Staff Member and Office Files within the White House Special Files. These files include, as a readily identifiable body of materials, Strachan's chronological files. These particular files, comprising 3.6 cubic feet, date from March 1971 to December 1972, when he left Haldeman's staff to assume the duties of general counsel at the United States Information Agency.\n\nThe materials are arranged into one series:LAFC: LAFC has announced its 2025 preseason schedule with five matches beginning on Jan. 20 with a closed-door friendly against Calgary FC of the Canadian Premier League.

UU.; en inglés: United States o US),[nota 3]​ denominado oficialmente Estados Unidos de América (EUA; en inglés: United States of America o USA)[13]​ es un país soberano constituido en una república federal constitucional compuesta por cincuenta estados y un distrito federal. Limita al norte con Canadá y al sur, con México. Su capital es Washington D. C. y su ciudad más poblada, Nueva York. La mayor parte del país se ubica en el medio de América del Norte ―donde se encuentran sus 48 estados contiguos y Washington D. C.―, entre los océanos Pacífico y Atlántico.\n\nEl estado de Alaska está en el noroeste del continente, limita con Canadá al este, separado de Rusia al oeste por el estrecho de Bering. El estado de Hawái es un archipiélago polinesio ubicado en Oceanía, en medio del océano Pacífico y es el único de sus estados que no se encuentra en América.\n\nEl país posee en el mar Caribe dos territorios no incorporados, el estado libre asociado de Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes, en el Pacífico otros territorios no incorporados, y a diferencia de estos últimos, un «territorio incorporado no organizado»: el atolón Palmyra.\n\nCon 9.83 millones de kilómetros cuadrados,[5]​ y con más de 340 millones de habitantes, el país está en el cuarto puesto por superficie total, en el quinto por superficie contigua y en el tercer por población. Es una de las naciones con más diversidad de etnias y culturas, producto de la inmigración a gran escala.[14]​\n\nEs la economía nacional más grande del mundo en términos nominales, con un PIB estimado en 22.6 billones de dólares (una cuarta parte del PIB global nominal) y una quinta parte del PIB global en paridad de poder adquisitivo.[9]​ El país es la principal fuerza capitalista del planeta, además de ser líder en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX y, desde comienzos del siglo XX, el principal país industrial. En PIB PPA, Estados Unidos es la segunda economía más grande, por detrás de la China.[15]​\n\nEl territorio continental estadounidense estuvo habitado por diversos grupos indígenas durante miles de años. Esta población aborigen fue reducida por las enfermedades y la guerra, después del primer contacto con los europeos. Estados Unidos fue fundado por trece colonias británicas, a lo largo de la costa atlántica. El 4 de julio de 1776, emitieron la Declaración de Independencia, que proclamó su derecho a la libre autodeterminación y el establecimiento de una unión cooperativa. Los estados rebeldes derrotaron al Imperio británico en la guerra de independencia, el primer conflicto bélico colonial exitoso de carácter independentista. ​ La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue adoptada el 17 de septiembre de 1787; su ratificación al año siguiente hizo a los estados parte de una sola república con un gobierno central fuerte. La Carta de Derechos, que comprende diez enmiendas constitucionales que garantizan muchos derechos civiles fundamentales y las libertades, fue ratificada en 1791.\n\nEn el siglo XIX, los Estados Unidos adquirieron territorios de Francia, España, Reino Unido, México, Rusia y Japón, además de anexionarse las repúblicas de Florida, Texas, California y Hawái. En la década de 1860, las disputas entre el sur agrario y conservador y el norte industrial y progresista sobre los derechos de los estados y la abolición de la esclavitud provocaron la Guerra de Secesión. La victoria del norte evitó una división permanente del país y condujo al final de la esclavitud legal. Para la década de 1890, la economía nacional era la más grande del mundo[17]​ y la guerra hispano-estadounidense y la Primera Guerra Mundial confirmaron su estatus como una potencia militar. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, surgió como el primer país con armas nucleares y miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nDurante la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos luchó en la guerra de Corea y la guerra de Vietnam, pero evitó el conflicto militar directo con la Unión Soviética. Las dos superpotencias compitieron en la Carrera Espacial, que culminó en el vuelo espacial de 1969 que llevó a los humanos a la Luna por primera vez. El final de la Guerra Fría y la disolución de la URSS la dejaron como la única superpotencia internacional. En el siglo XXI, los atentados del 11-S dieron lugar a la denominada guerra contra el terrorismo, y el ascenso de China y el regreso de Rusia conducen a una Nueva Guerra Fría, mientras que eventos como la crisis económica de 2008, la elección de Donald Trump como presidente en 2016 o las protestas por la muerte de George Floyd en 2020 provocaron tensiones sociales internas.\n\nEl país representa dos quintas partes del gasto militar mundial y es una fuerza económica, política y cultural, líder en el mundo.[18]​[19]​\n\nEn 1507, el cartógrafo alemán Martin Waldseemüller elaboró un planisferio en el que llamó a las tierras del hemisferio occidental «América», en honor al explorador y cartógrafo italiano Américo Vespucio.[20]​ Las antiguas colonias británicas utilizaron por primera vez el nombre del país moderno en la Declaración de Independencia, la «unánime declaración de los trece Estados Unidos de la América» adoptada por los «representantes de los Estados Unidos de América», 4 de julio de 1776.[21]​ El nombre actual se determinó el 15 de noviembre de 1777, cuando el Segundo Congreso Continental aprobó los Artículos de la Confederación, que estipulan, «El nombre de esta Confederación será “Los Estados Unidos de América”». «Columbia», un nombre una vez popular para los Estados Unidos, se deriva del nombre de Cristóbal Colón y aún permanece en el nombre del distrito de Columbia. Ocasionalmente se le llama, de forma incorrecta, «Estados Unidos de Norteamérica», derivando en una confusión en su gentilicio.\n\nLa manera estándar para referirse a un ciudadano de los Estados Unidos son los términos estadounidense (o estadunidense en Honduras y México).[13]​ También se utilizan gringo y yanqui, que pueden o no tener un matiz despectivo, según el uso, el contexto y el tono de la voz.[22]​ A veces se utiliza «norteamericano» como sinónimo de «estadounidense», pero se debe tener presente que la región de Norteamérica está formada por Canadá, Estados Unidos y la mayor parte de México, hasta el istmo de Tehuantepec. Debe evitarse el gentilicio «americano» para referirse exclusivamente a los naturales de los Estados Unidos[13]​ debido a que esta palabra engloba a todos los habitantes del continente americano. Por esta razón, el gentilicio recomendado es la palabra «estadounidense». Para escribir abreviadamente el nombre de este país suelen emplearse, de manera correcta, la abreviatura «EE. UU.» (Estados Unidos),[23]​ o la sigla «EUA» (Estados Unidos de América). Aunque frecuente, en español es incorrecto emplear la sigla anglosajona «USA».[13]​\n\nComúnmente se piensa que los pueblos indígenas de los Estados Unidos continentales, incluyendo a los nativos de Alaska, emigraron desde Asia entre doce mil y cuarenta mil años atrás.[24]​ Algunos, tales como la cultura misisipiana, desarrollaron una agricultura avanzada, grandes obras arquitectónicas y sociedades con un orden jerárquico. Después de que los europeos comenzaran a asentarse en América, hubo una acusada disminución de la población indígena debido a las epidemias de enfermedades traídas desde Europa, como la viruela.[25]​\n\nEn 1492, el navegante Cristóbal Colón, en su proyecto de circunnavegar hasta Asia, patrocinado por la Corona Española, llegó desde España hasta las islas del Caribe, realizando el primer contacto con los pueblos indígenas del Nuevo Mundo. El 2 de abril de 1513, el conquistador español Juan Ponce de León desembarcó en lo que llamó La Florida, siendo la primera llegada europea documentada en el territorio estadounidense. Los asentamientos españoles en la región fueron seguidos por otros en el actual suroeste de Estados Unidos. Los comerciantes de pieles franceses se establecieron en Nueva Francia, alrededor de la zona de los Grandes Lagos; finalmente Francia reclamaría gran parte del interior de Estados Unidos, hasta la costa del golfo de México. Los primeros asentamientos ingleses exitosos fueron la colonia de Virginia en Jamestown en 1607 y la colonia de Plymouth fundada por peregrinos en 1620. En 1628, el establecimiento de la provincia de la bahía de Massachusetts dio lugar a una nueva ola de inmigración: para 1634, Nueva Inglaterra estaba habitada por cerca de diez mil puritanos. Entre la década de 1610 y la guerra de independencia, cerca de cincuenta mil convictos fueron enviados desde el Viejo Continente hacia las colonias.[26]​ Desde 1614, los neerlandeses se establecieron a lo largo del río Hudson inferior, fundando Nueva Ámsterdam en la isla de Manhattan.\n\nEn 1674, los Países Bajos cedieron su territorio a Inglaterra y la provincia de los Nuevos Países Bajos fue renombrada con el nombre de Nueva York, convertida en la ciudad más importante de los Estados Unidos desde mediados del siglo XIX. Muchos inmigrantes recién llegados, especialmente en el sur, fueron contratados como criados, de tal modo que cerca de dos tercios de todos los inmigrantes que llegaron a Virginia entre 1630 y 1680 trabajaban como sirvientes. ​ Para finales de ese siglo, los esclavos africanos se convirtieron en la principal fuente de mano de obra en condiciones de servidumbre. Con la división de las Carolinas en 1729 y la colonización de Georgia en 1732, se establecieron las Trece Colonias británicas, que finalmente se convertirían en los Estados Unidos de América. Todas contaban con un gobierno local electo, apegado al republicanismo, además de que se legalizó el comercio de esclavos. Con altas tasas de nacimiento, bajas tasas de mortalidad y la constante inmigración, la población colonial creció rápidamente. El movimiento cristiano revivalista de las décadas de 1730 y 1740, conocido como «el Gran Despertar», alimentó el interés en temas como la religión y la libertad de culto. En la guerra franco-india, las fuerzas británicas le arrebataron Canadá a Francia, pero la población de habla francesa permaneció políticamente aislada de las colonias del sur. Sin contar a los nativos americanos (popularmente conocidos como «indios») que finalmente fueron desplazados en contra de su voluntad, en 1770 las Trece colonias tenían una población de 2.6 millones de habitantes, alrededor de una tercera parte de la del Reino Unido, aunque casi uno de cada cinco estadounidenses era un esclavo negro. ​ Sin embargo, los colonos estadounidenses no tenían ninguna representación en el Parlamento del Reino Unido.\n\nLas tensiones entre los colonos y los británicos durante las décadas de 1760 y 1770 condujeron a la Guerra de Independencia, que se extendió desde 1775 hasta 1781. El 14 de junio de 1775, el Congreso Continental, reunido en Filadelfia, estableció un Ejército Continental bajo el mando de George Washington. Proclamando que «todos los hombres nacen iguales» y dotados de «ciertos derechos inalienables», el Congreso aprobó la Declaración de Independencia, redactada en gran parte por Thomas Jefferson, el 4 de julio de 1776.[29]​ Anualmente, en esta fecha se celebra el Día de la Independencia de los Estados Unidos. Así, Estados Unidos se convirtió en la primera nación americana en declarar su independencia. En 1777, los artículos de la Confederación establecieron un débil gobierno confederal, que operó hasta 1789.\n\nDespués de la derrota británica por las fuerzas estadounidenses, asistidas por franceses y españoles, el Reino Unido reconoció su independencia y soberanía sobre el territorio al este del río Misisipi. Una convención constitucional fue organizada en 1787 por aquellos que deseaban establecer un gobierno nacional fuerte. La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue ratificada en 1788 y un año más tarde, George Washington se convirtió en el primer presidente. La Carta de Derechos, que prohibía la restricción federal de los derechos humanos y garantizaba una serie de medidas para su protección jurídica, fue adoptada en 1791.[30]​\n\nCon la nueva autonomía, las actitudes hacia la esclavitud fueron cambiando; una cláusula en la Constitución protegió el comercio de esclavos hasta 1808. Los estados del norte abolieron la esclavitud entre 1780 y 1804, dejando a los estados esclavistas del sur como defensores de la «institución peculiar». El «Segundo Gran Despertar», que comenzó alrededor de 1800, convirtió a las Iglesias evangélicas en una de las principales fuerzas detrás de varios de los movimientos reformistas de la época, incluyendo el abolicionismo.[31]​\n\nEn 1803, la compra de la Luisiana a Francia durante el mandato del presidente Thomas Jefferson, casi duplicó el tamaño de la nación,[32]​ al mismo tiempo que la guerra anglo-estadounidense de 1812 fortaleció aún más el nacionalismo entre la población. Derrotado por el Reino Unido y tras su segunda y definitiva abdicación al trono francés en 1815, Napoleón Bonaparte intentó escapar a Estados Unidos, entonces rival del Reino Unido, pero fue capturado por las fuerzas británicas y deportado a Santa Helena. En 1819, una serie de incursiones militares en Florida obligó a España a ceder este y otros territorios de la costa del golfo.[32]​ El sendero de lágrimas en la década de 1830 ejemplifica la política de Remoción India que despojó a varios pueblos indígenas de sus tierras. Estados Unidos se anexó la República de Texas en 1845, época durante la cual el concepto del Destino Manifiesto se popularizó. ​ En 1846, la firma del Tratado de Oregón con el Reino Unido, le otorgó al país los actuales territorios del noroeste.[32]​ Dos años más tarde, la victoria en la guerra contra México dio lugar a la cesión de California y la mayor parte del suroeste actual.[32]​ La fiebre del oro de 1848 y 1849 estimuló aún más la migración hacia el oeste y los nuevos ferrocarriles facilitaron la reubicación de los colonos y el aumento de los conflictos con los nativos americanos. Durante medio siglo, hasta 40 millones de bisontes americanos fueron sacrificados por sus pieles y carne para facilitar la propagación de los ferrocarriles. La pérdida de los búfalos, una fuente principal de alimento para los indígenas de las llanuras, fue un golpe mortal para muchas culturas nativas.[34]​\n\nLas tensiones entre estados pro-esclavistas y los abolicionistas, junto al aumento de los desacuerdos en la relación entre el gobierno federal y estatal, provocaron conflictos violentos por causa de la expansión de la esclavitud hacia los nuevos territorios. Abraham Lincoln, candidato del Partido Republicano y un gran abolicionista, fue elegido presidente en 1860. Antes de que tomase posesión de su cargo, seis estados esclavistas declararon su secesión de la Unión, formando los Estados Confederados de América, si bien otros estados también esclavistas permanecieron leales a la Unión.[35]​ El gobierno federal declaró que la secesión era ilegal y pronto se produjo el ataque por parte de los secesionistas a Fort Sumter, iniciándose así la guerra civil estadounidense el 12 de abril de 1861.[36]​\n\nTras la victoria de la Unión el 9 de abril de 1865, se añadieron tres enmiendas a la constitución para garantizar la libertad de los casi 4 millones de afroamericanos que habían sido esclavos, convirtiéndolos en ciudadanos y dándoles el derecho de voto.[37]​ La guerra y su resolución dio lugar a un aumento sustancial de las competencias del gobierno federal. ​\n\nDespués del asesinato de Abraham Lincoln, tuvo lugar la época conocida como la Reconstrucción, en la cual se desarrollaron políticas encaminadas a la reintegración y la reconstrucción de los estados sureños garantizando al mismo tiempo los derechos de los nuevos esclavos liberados. Las controvertidas elecciones presidenciales de 1876 se resolvieron mediante el Compromiso de 1877, por el cual los demócratas sureños reconocieron como presidente a Rutherford B. Hayes a cambio de que este retirara las tropas que aún permanecían desplegadas en Luisiana, Carolina del Sur y Florida. A partir de 1876 empiezan a aplicarse las llamadas leyes de Jim Crow, una política de apartheid que perduraría hasta 1965.[39]​ La Masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último conflicto armado en la larga guerra con los pueblos originarios.[40]​\n\nEn el norte, la urbanización sin precedentes y una afluencia de inmigrantes aceleró la industrialización del país. La ola de la inmigración, que duró hasta 1929, proporcionó mano de obra para los negocios, transformado a su vez la cultura. La alta protección arancelaria, la creación de infraestructuras nacionales y los nuevos reglamentos bancarios alentaron el crecimiento industrial. En 1867, se produce la compra de Alaska a Rusia, completando la expansión continental del país.[32]​ La masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último gran conflicto armado contra los nativos indios americanos. En 1893, la monarquía indígena del Reino de Hawái fue derrocada en un golpe de Estado liderado por ciudadanos estadounidenses; el archipiélago fue anexado al país en 1898.[32]​ La victoria en la guerra hispano-estadounidense ese mismo año, demostró que Estados Unidos era una potencia mundial y dio lugar a la ocupación de Cuba y la anexión de Puerto Rico y las Filipinas.[41]​ Filipinas accedió a la independencia en 1946, mientras que Puerto Rico continúa siendo un Estado libre asociado.\n\nAl estallar la Primera Guerra Mundial en Europa en 1914, Estados Unidos se declaró neutral. Posteriormente, los estadounidenses se solidarizaron con los británicos y franceses, a pesar de que muchos ciudadanos, sobre todo los originarios de Irlanda y Alemania, se opusieron a la intervención. ​ En 1917 se sumaron a los Aliados, contribuyendo a la derrota de las Potencias Centrales. Reacio a participar en asuntos europeos, el Senado no ratificó el Tratado de Versalles (1919), que estableció la Sociedad de Naciones, aplicando una política de unilateralismo, que rayaba en el aislacionismo. ​ En 1920, el movimiento de los derechos de la mujer ganó la aprobación de una enmienda constitucional para otorgar a las mujeres el sufragio.[30]​\n\nDurante la mayor parte de la década de 1920, el país gozó de un período de prosperidad, disminuyendo el desequilibrio de la balanza de pagos mientras crecían las ganancias de las granjas industriales. Este período, conocido como los felices años veinte, culminó en la crisis de 1929 que desencadenó la Gran Depresión. Después de su elección como presidente en 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt respondió con el New Deal (nuevo trato), una serie de políticas que aumentaron la intervención del gobierno en la economía.[44]​ De 1920 a 1933 se estableció una ley seca conocida como La prohibición.[45]​ La Dust Bowl (cuenca de polvo) de mediados de la década de 1930 dejó varias comunidades de agricultores empobrecidos y estimuló una nueva ola de migración hacia la costa occidental.[46]​\n\nEstados Unidos, oficialmente neutral durante las primeras etapas de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, inició el suministro de provisiones a los Aliados en marzo de 1941, a través del Programa de Préstamo y Arriendo. El 7 de diciembre de 1941, el país se unió a la lucha de los Aliados contra las Potencias del Eje, después del ataque japonés a Pearl Harbor. La Segunda Guerra Mundial impulsó la economía mediante el suministro de capital de inversión y puestos de trabajo, haciendo que muchas mujeres entraran en el mercado laboral. De los principales combatientes, Estados Unidos fue la única nación que se enriqueció a causa de la guerra. ​ Las conferencias en Bretton Woods y Yalta crearon un nuevo sistema de organización internacional que colocó al país y a la Unión Soviética en el centro de los asuntos mundiales. En 1945, cuando llegó el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial en Europa, una conferencia internacional celebrada en San Francisco redactó la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, que entró en vigor después de la guerra.[48]​ Después de haber desarrollado la primera arma nuclear, el gobierno decidió utilizarla en las ciudades japonesas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki en agosto de ese mismo año. Japón se rindió el 2 de septiembre, poniendo fin a la guerra.[49]​\n\nEn la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética compitieron tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, dominando los asuntos militares de Europa a través de la OTAN y del Pacto de Varsovia. El primero promovió la democracia liberal y el capitalismo, mientras que el segundo extendía el comunismo y una economía planificada por el gobierno. Ambos apoyaron varias dictaduras y participaron en guerras subsidiarias. Entre 1950 y 1953, las tropas estadounidenses combatieron a las fuerzas comunistas chinas en la guerra de Corea.[50]​ Desde la ruptura con la URSS y el inicio de la Guerra Fría y hasta 1957, dentro de Estados Unidos se desarrolló el macarthismo, también llamado Segundo Temor rojo, en el que el Estado desató una ola de represión política y una campaña de miedo contra aquellas personas comunistas o simplemente sospechosas de serlo, que algunos autores señalan como propio de un Estado totalitario. Cientos de personas fueron detenidas, incluidas decenas de celebridades, y entre diez mil y doce mil personas perdieron sus puestos de trabajo.[51]​ La persecución finalizó cuando los tribunales la declararon inconstitucional.[52]​\n\nEn 1961, el lanzamiento soviético de la primera nave espacial tripulada provocó que el presidente John F. Kennedy propusiera al país ser los primeros en enviar «un hombre a la Luna», hecho logrado en 1969.[53]​ Kennedy también enfrentó un tenso conflicto nuclear con las fuerzas soviéticas en Cuba, al tiempo que la economía crecía y se expandía de manera constante. Un creciente movimiento por los derechos civiles, representado y liderado por afroamericanos como Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King y James Bevel, utilizó la no violencia para hacer frente a la segregación y la discriminación.[54]​ Después del asesinato de Kennedy en 1963, la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964 y la Ley de Derechos Electorales de 1965 se aprobaron durante el mandato del presidente Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson y su sucesor, Richard Nixon, llevaron una guerra civil subsidiaria en el sudeste asiático a la infructuosa guerra de Vietnam.[50]​ Un movimiento contracultural generalizado creció, impulsado por la oposición a la guerra, el nacionalismo negro y la revolución sexual. También surgió una nueva ola de movimientos feministas, liderados por Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem y otras mujeres que buscaban la equidad política, social y económica.\n\nEn 1974, como resultado del escándalo Watergate, Nixon se convirtió en el primer presidente en renunciar, para evitar ser destituido por cargos como obstrucción a la justicia y abuso de poder; fue sucedido por el vicepresidente Gerald Ford.[55]​ La administración de Jimmy Carter en la segunda mitad de la década de 1970 (1977-1981) estuvo marcada por la estanflación y la crisis de los rehenes en Irán. La elección de Ronald Reagan como presidente en 1980 anunció un cambio en la política estadounidense, que se reflejó en reformas importantes en los impuestos y gastos fiscales. Su segundo mandato trajo consigo el escándalo Irán-Contra y el significativo progreso diplomático con la Unión Soviética. El posterior colapso soviético terminó la Guerra Fría.\n\nBajo el mandato del presidente George H. W. Bush, el país tomó un papel de liderazgo hegemónico mundial, como en la guerra del Golfo (1991). La expansión económica más larga en la historia moderna de Estados Unidos, desde marzo de 1991 hasta marzo de 2001, abarcó la administración de Bill Clinton y la burbuja punto com.[56]​ Una demanda civil y un escándalo sexual llevó al impeachment de Clinton en 1998, aunque logró terminar su periodo. Las elecciones presidenciales de 2000, de las más competidas en la historia estadounidense, fueron resueltas por una decisión de la Corte Suprema. George W. Bush, hijo de George H. W. Bush, fue proclamado presidente a pesar de que obtuvo menos votos que su rival, Al Gore.[57]​ Esta situación, que ha ocurrido tres veces en la historia, se debe al sistema de voto estadounidense (colegiado).\n\nEl 11 de septiembre de 2001, los terroristas del grupo Al-Qaeda atacaron las Torres Gemelas del World Trade Center de la ciudad de Nueva York (que fueron destruidas) y El Pentágono cerca de Washington D. C., en una serie de atentados que acabó con la vida de casi tres mil personas. En respuesta, la administración de Bush lanzó la «guerra contra el terrorismo». A finales de 2001, las fuerzas estadounidenses invadieron Afganistán, derrocaron al gobierno talibán y destruyeron los campos de entrenamiento de Al-Qaeda. Los insurgentes talibanes continúan luchando una guerra de guerrillas. En 2002 Bush comenzó a presionar para que se llevara a cabo un cambio de régimen en Irak.[58]​[59]​ Con la falta de apoyo de la OTAN y sin un mandato explícito de la ONU para una intervención militar, Bush organizó la coalición de la voluntad; las fuerzas de la coalición rápidamente invadieron Irak en 2003 y derrocaron al dictador Saddam Hussein. Al año siguiente, Bush fue reelegido como el presidente más votado en unas elecciones.\n\nEn 2005, el huracán Katrina, que terminaría siendo el desastre natural más mortífero en la historia nacional, causó una destrucción severa a lo largo de la costa del Golfo: la ciudad de Nueva Orleans quedó devastada,[60]​ con 1833 muertos.\n\nEl 4 de noviembre de 2008, en medio de una recesión económica mundial, Barack Obama fue elegido presidente, habiendo sido el primer afroamericano en ocupar el cargo. En mayo de 2011, las fuerzas especiales estadounidenses lograron matar a Osama bin Laden, escondido en Pakistán. Al año siguiente, Barack Obama fue reelegido. Bajo su segundo mandato impartió la guerra contra el Estado Islámico y se restablecieron las relaciones diplomáticas con Cuba.\n\nEl 8 de noviembre de 2016, el magnate Donald Trump por el Partido Republicano venció a la ex primera dama Hillary Clinton para la presidencia en unas elecciones insólitas[61]​ y cuyos planes han sido descritos por analistas políticos como populistas, proteccionistas y nacionalistas, jurando el cargo el 20 de enero de 2017.\n\nLas masacres en Orlando del 12 de junio de 2016 en la discoteca gay Pulse (51 muertos)[62]​ y en Las Vegas el 1 de octubre de 2017 (60) figuran como las mayores matanzas del país desde los atentados del 11-S.\n\nEl 7 de noviembre de 2020, Joe Biden gana las elecciones presidenciales, venciendo a Donald Trump quien no consiguió la reelección presidencial. Es la segunda vez que un presidente estadounidense no alcanza la reelección después de George H. W. Bush. Biden juró al cargo el 20 de enero de 2021. El 6 de enero de 2021, los partidarios del presidente saliente Trump irrumpieron en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos en un esfuerzo infructuoso por interrumpir el recuento de votos del Colegio Electoral presidencial.[63]​\n\nEstados Unidos es la federación más antigua del mundo. Es una república constitucional, democrática y representativa, «en la que el mandato de la mayoría es regulado por los derechos de las minorías, protegidos por la ley». ​ El gobierno está regulado por un sistema de controles y equilibrios, definidos por la Constitución, que sirve como el documento legal supremo del país.[65]​ En el sistema federalista estadounidense, los ciudadanos están generalmente sujetos a tres niveles de gobierno: federal, estatal y local; los deberes del gobierno local comúnmente se dividen entre los gobiernos de los condados y municipios. En casi todos los casos, los funcionarios del poder ejecutivo y legislativo son elegidos por sufragio directo de los ciudadanos del distrito.\n\nEl gobierno federal se divide en tres ramas de poder:[65]​\n• Poder legislativo: El Congreso bicameral, compuesto por el Senado y la Cámara de Representantes. Su función es crear las leyes federales, hacer declaraciones de guerra, aprobar los tratados, administran los fondos públicos y tiene el poder del impeachment, por medio del cual pueden destituir a funcionarios del gobierno.\n• Poder ejecutivo: El presidente es el comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas, puede vetar los proyectos de ley antes de que se conviertan en leyes oficiales y nombra a los miembros del gabinete (sujeto a la aprobación del Senado) y otros oficiales, que administran y hacer cumplir las leyes federales y políticas.\n• Poder judicial: La Corte Suprema y los tribunales federales inferiores, cuyos jueces son nombrados por el presidente con la aprobación del Senado, interpretan las leyes y suprimen las que se consideren anticonstitucionales.\n\nLa Cámara de Representantes tiene 435 miembros electos, cada uno representando a un distrito del Congreso para un mandato de dos años.[65]​ Los lugares dentro de la cámara se distribuyen entre los estados según su población cada diez años. Según el censo de 2000, siete estados tienen el mínimo de un representante, mientras que California, el estado más poblado, tiene cincuenta y tres. El Senado tiene cien miembros, ya que cada estado cuenta con dos senadores, elegidos para un término de seis años; un tercio de los escaños en el Senado son electos cada dos años.[65]​ La Corte Suprema, liderada por el jefe de justicia, tiene nueve miembros, que sirven de manera permanente.[65]​\n\nEl presidente cumple mandato por un término de cuatro años y podrá ser reelegido para el cargo no más de una vez. El presidente no es elegido por sufragio directo, sino por un sistema indirecto de colegios electorales, en el que los votos determinantes son prorrateados por estado.[65]​ Un estado solo puede brindar determinada cantidad de votos según el número de congresistas que tenga dentro del poder legislativo: senadores (dos por cada estado) y representantes (que varía según la población de cada estado); dando un total de 538 miembros. El sistema bipartidista del país permite que un candidato a la presidencia, ya sea republicano o demócrata, solo necesite 270 votos para asegurar la victoria.[66]​\n\nLos gobiernos de los cincuenta estados están estructurados de manera más o menos similar, aunque Nebraska es el único que tiene una legislatura unicameral.[67]​ El gobernador (jefe ejecutivo) de cada estado es elegido por sufragio directo. Algunos jueces de estado y funcionarios de gabinete son designados por los gobernadores de los respectivos estados, mientras que otros son elegidos por voto popular.\n\nTodas las leyes y los procedimientos gubernamentales están sujetas a revisión judicial, y se anula cualquier ley que esté en contra de la Constitución. El texto original de la Constitución establece la estructura y responsabilidades del gobierno federal y su relación con los gobiernos estados.[65]​ El Artículo I protege el derecho al «gran recurso» de habeas corpus[30]​ y el Artículo III garantiza el derecho a un juicio con jurado en todos los casos penales.[30]​ Las enmiendas a la Constitución requieren la aprobación de tres cuartas partes de los estados. La Constitución ha sido enmendada veintisiete veces; las primeras diez enmiendas, que componen la Carta de Derechos y la decimocuarta enmienda forman la base central de las garantías individuales.[30]​\n\nEstados Unidos ejerce una influencia económica, política y militar a nivel mundial. Es un miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas, además de que la Sede de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas se encuentra en la ciudad de Nueva York. También es miembro del G8, el G-20 y la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico. La inmensa mayoría de los países tienen una embajada o un consulado en Washington D. C. u otra ciudad importante del país. A su vez, casi todos los países del mundo cuentan con una misión diplomática estadounidense.[68]​ Sin embargo, Corea del Norte, Bután, Sudán y la República de China (Taiwán) no tienen relaciones diplomáticas formales con la nación.\n\nTambién goza de fuertes lazos con el Reino Unido, Canadá, Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Japón, Corea del Sur e Israel. Trabaja en estrecha colaboración con sus colegas de la Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte sobre cuestiones militares y de seguridad, y con sus vecinos a través de la Organización de los Estados Americanos y de tratados internacionales como el acuerdo trilateral del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte con Canadá y México. En 2012, Estados Unidos gastó un neto de 30 460 millones de dólares en ayuda oficial al desarrollo, la mayor cantidad en el mundo, aunque en términos de porcentaje del producto interior bruto (PIB), su contribución de 0.19 % ocupó uno de los últimos lugares entre las veintitrés naciones donantes. En contraste, las empresas privadas estadounidenses son relativamente más generosas.[69]​[70]​\n\nEl presidente ostenta el título de comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas de la nación y nombra a sus líderes: el Secretario de Defensa y la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor. El Departamento de Defensa administra las fuerzas armadas, incluyendo el Ejército, la Armada, el Cuerpo de Marines y la Fuerza Aérea. La Guardia Costera es administrada por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional en tiempos de paz y por el Departamento de la Armada en tiempo de guerra. En 2008, las fuerzas armadas contaban con 1.4 millones de miembros activos. Las reservas y la Guardia Nacional elevan el número total de tropas a 2.3 millones. El Departamento de Defensa también emplea a aproximadamente setencientos mil civiles, sin incluir a los contratistas.[71]​\n\nEl servicio militar es voluntario, aunque en tiempos de guerra el Estado puede imponer el reclutamiento a través de un sistema de servicio selectivo, el llamado «Selective Service System».[72]​ Como la gran potencia militar del mundo, las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos poseen las más avanzadas máquinas de guerra. Cuenta con miles de aviones, cientos de embarcaciones, carros de combate, misiles intercontinentales (ICBM), miles de ojivas nucleares y tiene diez portaaviones activos en la Armada; además, posee fuerzas aeronavales de carácter permanente en las costas del océano Atlántico ―Fleet Forces Command―, Pacífico ―Flota del Pacífico― y el Golfo Pérsico ―Quinta Flota―.\n\nLa instalación progresiva de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses a gran escala empezó con la división y ocupación de Alemania en 1945, se amplió con la guerra fría en sus países de influencia, y continúa vigente.\n\nEl ejército opera alrededor de 870 bases e instalaciones en el extranjero[73]​ y mantiene guarniciones de más de 100 militares activos en 28 países distintos.[74]​ El alcance de esta presencia militar global ha llevado a algunos autores a describir al país como si mantuviera un «imperio de bases».[75]​[76]​\n\nLos gastos militares en 2020, fueron de 740 500 millones de dólares,[77]​ aproximadamente el 37.5 % del gasto militar mundial[78]​ y más altos que los gastos juntos de los siguientes catorce países con los ejércitos más grandes. El gasto per cápita fue de 1967 dólares, alrededor de nueve veces el promedio mundial; ocupando el 4.4 % del PIB[79]​ y el 18 % del presupuesto federal.[80]​ El presupuesto base del Departamento de Defensa para 2010 ―fijado en 533 800 millones de dólares― aumentó un 4 % en 2009 y un 80 % más que en 2001; se destinarán 130 000 millones de dólares adicionales para las campañas militares en Irak y Afganistán.[81]​ En mayo de 2010 había 94 000 soldados estadounidenses desplegados en Afganistán y 92 000 en Irak.[82]​ Para junio de 2010, el ejército estadounidense había sufrido 4400 bajas durante la guerra en Irak[83]​ y 1087 durante la guerra en Afganistán.[84]​\n\nEstados Unidos cuenta, según las informaciones disponibles, con los mayores servicios de inteligencia del mundo, que se agrupan y coordinan alrededor de la llamada Comunidad de Inteligencia ―United States Intelligence Community (IC)―. Diecisiete agencias federales de inteligencia forman esta comunidad; estas agencias generalmente están subordinadas al Departamento de Defensa o al Departamento de Justicia, mientras que otras tienen la consideración de agencia independiente federal, por lo que solo deben rendir cuentas al Director Nacional de Inteligencia y al Presidente de los Estados Unidos. Las agencias de la comunidad ―tanto militares como civiles― se dedican a actividades de inteligencia relacionadas con asuntos exteriores y la seguridad nacional y cuentan con cientos de miles de empleados ―107 035 a mediados de 2013, último dato conocido―[85]​ y unos presupuestos confidenciales que solo en 2013 sumaron 52 600 millones de dólares.[85]​ Una de las agencias que la componen es la célebre Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA).[86]​\n\nEn 2010, según informaciones de The Washington Post, 1271 organizaciones gubernamentales, 1931 empresas privadas y 854 000 personas con acceso a espacios e información de alto secreto se dedicaban en Estados Unidos a labores de contraterrorismo, inteligencia y seguridad nacional.[87]​\n\nEn materia de derechos humanos, respecto a la pertenencia a los siete organismos de la Carta Internacional de Derechos Humanos, que incluyen al Comité de Derechos Humanos (HRC), Estados Unidos de América ha firmado o ratificado:\n\nEstados Unidos es una unión federal de cincuenta estados. Los trece estados originales fueron los sucesores de las Trece Colonias que se rebelaron contra el Imperio británico. Poco después de la independencia, se crearon tres nuevos estados a partir de otros ya existentes: Kentucky de Virginia; Tennessee de Carolina del Norte y Maine de Massachusetts. La mayoría de los otros estados fueron creados a partir de territorios obtenidos a través de la guerra o la compra por parte del gobierno. Vermont, Texas y Hawái son la excepción: cada uno de ellos fue una república independiente antes de integrarse a la Unión. Durante la guerra de Secesión, Virginia Occidental se separó de Virginia. El estado más reciente es Hawái, que logró el reconocimiento como estado el 21 de agosto de 1959. Los estados no tienen el derecho de separarse de la Unión.\n\nLos estados componen gran parte del territorio estadounidense; las otras dos áreas que se consideran parte integrante del país son el Distrito de Columbia ―el distrito federal donde se encuentra la capital Washington D. C.― y el Atolón Palmyra, un territorio deshabitado pero incorporado, ubicado en el océano Pacífico. Estados Unidos también posee cinco grandes territorios de ultramar: Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos en el Caribe y Samoa Americana, Guam y las Islas Marianas del Norte en el Pacífico. Aquellos que nacieron en esos territorios (excepto en la Samoa Americana) poseen la ciudadanía estadounidense. Los ciudadanos estadounidenses que residen en los territorios tienen muchos de los derechos y responsabilidades de los ciudadanos que residen en los estados; sin embargo, generalmente están exentos del pago de impuestos federales, no pueden votar en las elecciones presidenciales y solo tienen representación en calidad de observadores en el Congreso. ​\n\nLa superficie de los Estados Unidos continentales es de aproximadamente 7 700 000 km² (kilómetros cuadrados). Alaska, que está separada de los Estados Unidos continentales por Canadá, es el estado más grande del país, con 1 500 000 km². Hawái, ocupa un archipiélago ubicado en el Pacífico central, al suroeste de América del Norte, que abarca poco más de 16 000 km².[99]​ Después de Rusia y Canadá, es el tercer o cuarto país más grande del mundo por área total (tierra y agua), clasificado justo por encima o por debajo de China. La lista varía dependiendo de si se consideran los territorios en disputa entre China y la India y de cómo se calcula el tamaño total de los Estados Unidos: The World Factbook de la CIA considera 9 833 517 km²,[5]​ la División de Estadísticas de las Naciones Unidas calcula 9 629 091 km²,[100]​ y la Enciclopedia Británica estipula 9 522 055 km².[101]​ Incluyendo solo la superficie de la tierra, Estados Unidos es tercero en tamaño detrás de Rusia y Canadá, justo por delante de China.[102]​\n\nEl territorio nacional cuenta con múltiples formas de relieve y accidentes geográficos. A medida que se avanza tierra adentro, la llanura costera del litoral Atlántico da lugar al bosque caducifolio y a la meseta de Piedmont. Los Apalaches separan la costa oriental de los Grandes Lagos de las praderas del Medio Oeste. El río Misisipi-Misuri, el cuarto sistema fluvial más largo del mundo, corre de norte a sur a través del centro del país. La pradera llana y fértil de las Grandes Llanuras se extiende hacia el oeste, hasta que es interrumpida por una región de tierras altas en el sureste. Las Montañas Rocosas, en el borde occidental de las Grandes Llanuras, atraviesan de norte a sur todo el país, llegando a altitudes superiores a los 4300 m s. n. m. (metros sobre el nivel del mar) en Colorado. Más hacia el oeste se encuentra la Gran Cuenca y los desiertos, tales como el desierto de Mojave, de Sonora y de Chihuahua. Las montañas de la Sierra Nevada y la cordillera de las Cascadas se encuentran cerca de la costa del Pacífico. Con sus 6194 m s. n. m., el monte McKinley en Alaska es el punto más alto del país. Los volcanes activos son comunes a lo largo de Alaska y las islas Aleutianas, además de que Hawái consta de solo islas volcánicas. El supervolcán ubicado debajo del parque nacional Yellowstone en las montañas Rocosas, es la forma volcánica más grande del continente.[103]​\n\nPor su gran tamaño y variedad geográfica, el país cuenta con la mayoría de los tipos de clima. Al este del meridiano 100, el clima varía de continental húmedo en el norte a húmedo subtropical en el sur. El extremo sur de la Florida y las islas de Hawái tienen un clima tropical. Las Grandes Llanuras al oeste del meridiano 100 son semiáridas, mientras que gran parte de las montañas occidentales poseen un clima alpino. El clima es árido en la Gran Cuenca y en los desiertos del suroeste, es mediterráneo en la costa de California y oceánico en la costa sur de Alaska, Oregón y Washington. La mayor parte del territorio alaskeño tiene un clima subártico o polar. Los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos no son raros; los estados ribereños del golfo de México son propensos a huracanes y la mayoría de los tornados del mundo se desarrollan dentro del país, principalmente en la zona de Tornado Alley, en el Medio Oeste.[104]​\n\nEstados Unidos es considerado un país megadiverso: unas 17 000 especies de plantas vasculares viven en los Estados Unidos contiguos y Alaska y más de 1800 especies de plantas con flores se pueden encontrar tan solo en Hawái, pocas de las cuales crecen en el continente.[105]​ El país es el hábitat de más de 400 especies de mamíferos, 750 especies de aves y 500 especies de reptiles y anfibios.[106]​ Aquí también se han descubierto más de 91 000 diferentes clases de insectos.[107]​\n\nLa Ley de Especies en Peligro aprobada en 1973 protege a las especies amenazadas y en peligro de extinción y sus hábitats, que son supervisados por el Servicio de Pesca y Vida Silvestre de los Estados Unidos. En total, el gobierno federal posee el 28.8 % de la superficie total del país.[108]​ La mayor parte de este porcentaje está conformado por los cincuenta y ocho parques nacionales y cientos de otras áreas naturales protegidas administradas por las autoridades federales y estatales.[109]​ Del resto de las tierras del gobierno, algunas son alquiladas para la extracción de petróleo y gas natural, para la minería, agricultura o ganadería; solo el 2.4 % se utiliza para fines militares.[108]​\n\nLa economía de los Estados Unidos es una economía mixta capitalista, que se caracteriza por los abundantes recursos naturales, una infraestructura desarrollada y una alta productividad. ​ De acuerdo al Fondo Monetario Internacional, su PIB de 15.7 billones USD constituye el 24 % del Producto Mundial Bruto y cerca del 21 % del mismo en términos de paridad de poder adquisitivo (PPA).[9]​ Este es el PIB más grande en el mundo, aunque en 2008 era un 5 % menor que el PIB (PPA) de la Unión Europea. El país tiene el undécimo PIB per cápita nominal y el sexto PIB (PPA) per cápita más altos del mundo.[9]​ Además, el país está en segundo lugar del Índice de Competitividad Global de 2010.[111]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el importador de bienes más grande a nivel internacional y el tercero en términos de exportaciones, aunque las exportaciones per cápita son relativamente bajas para ser un país desarrollado. En 2008, el total de la balanza comercial estadounidense era de 696 000 millones de dólares.[112]​ En 2009, los automóviles constituyeron los principales productos exportados e importados.[113]​ Canadá, China, México, Alemania y Japón son sus principales socios comerciales.[114]​ Ese último es el que tiene la mayor deuda pública con Estados Unidos, ya que a principios de 2010 superó la deuda de China con 34 200 millones de dólares.[115]​\n\nEn 2010, el sector privado constituía un estimado del 55.3 % de la economía de Estados Unidos, las actividades del gobierno federal sumaban el 24.1 % y la actividad de los gobiernos estatales y locales ocupaban el restante 20.6 %.[118]​ Pese a que la economía estadounidense es posindustrial, ya que el sector servicios contribuye con el 67.8 % del PIB, la nación continúa siendo una potencia industrial.[119]​ En el campo de negocios, la actividad líder por sus ingresos es el comercio al por mayor y al por menor; por ingresos netos es la industria,[120]​ siendo la industria química la más importante.[121]​ Estados Unidos es el tercer productor de petróleo más importante en el mundo, así como el mayor importador de este producto.[122]​[123]​[124]​ También es el productor número uno de energía eléctrica y de energía nuclear, así como gas natural licuado, azufre, fosfatos y sal. Mientras que la agricultura representa menos del 1 % del PIB,[119]​ el país es el mayor productor de maíz[125]​ y soya.[126]​ Toda esta producción contribuye a que la bolsa de Nueva York sea la más grande del mundo.[127]​ A su vez, las empresas estadounidenses de Coca-Cola, McDonalds y Microsoft son las marcas más reconocidas en el mundo.[128]​\n\nEn el tercer trimestre de 2009, la fuerza de trabajo estadounidense era de 154.4 millones de personas. De estos empleados, un 81 % poseía un empleo en el sector de los servicios. Con 22.4 millones de personas, el gobierno es el principal campo de empleo.[129]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los trabajadores están sindicalizados, en comparación con el 30 % de Europa occidental.[130]​ El Banco Mundial clasifica a los Estados Unidos en primer lugar en la facilidad de contratación y liquidación de los trabajadores.[131]​ Entre 1973 y 2003, el año laboral para un estadounidense promedio creció 199 horas.[132]​ En parte como consecuencia, el país sostiene la máxima productividad de mano de obra en el mundo. En 2008, también llegó al primer puesto en productividad por hora, superando a Noruega, Francia, Bélgica y Luxemburgo, que habían superado a los Estados Unidos la mayor parte de la década anterior.[133]​ Comparado con Europa, los impuestos corporativos y de propiedad son más altos, mientras que los impuestos al consumidor son más bajos.[134]​\n\nAl ser un país desarrollado, Estados Unidos cuenta con una infraestructura de transportes avanzada: 6 465 799 km (kilómetros) de carreteras, 226 427 km de vías férreas, 15 095 aeropuertos y 41 009 km de vías fluviales.[136]​ La mayor parte de sus habitantes utilizan el automóvil como su principal medio de transporte. En 2003, había 759 automóviles por cada 1000 personas, en comparación con los 472 por cada 1000 habitantes de la Unión Europea.[137]​ Más del 40 % de los vehículos personales son camionetas, todoterrenos o camiones ligeros.[138]​ El adulto estadounidense promedio (incluyendo a conductores y no conductores) pasa diariamente 55 minutos en un automóvil, viajando una distancia de 47 km.[139]​\n\nLa industria aérea civil es propiedad privada, mientras que la mayoría de aeropuertos son de propiedad pública. Las tres aerolíneas más grandes en el mundo son de capital estadounidense: Southwest Airlines, American Airlines y Delta Air Lines.[140]​ De los treinta aeropuertos con mayor tránsito de pasajeros en el mundo, dieciséis están en el país, siendo el más concurrido de todos el Aeropuerto Internacional Hartsfield-Jackson en Atlanta.[141]​ Mientras que el transporte de mercancías por ferrocarril es muy importante, relativamente pocas personas utilizan este medio de transporte para viajar, dentro o entre las zonas urbanas.[142]​ Solamente el 9 % de las personas utilizan el transporte público para acudir al trabajo, un nivel muy bajo comparado con el 38.8 % de Europa.[143]​ También el uso de la bicicleta es mínimo, muy por debajo de los niveles europeos.[144]​\n\nEl consumo energético total del país es de 3873 billones kWh anuales, lo que equivale a un consumo per cápita de 7.8 toneladas de petróleo al año.[136]​ En 2005, un 40 % de esta energía provenía del petróleo, 23 % del carbón y 22 % del gas natural; el resto provenía de centrales nucleares y fuentes de energía renovable.[145]​ Estados Unidos es el mayor consumidor de petróleo y de gas natural: anualmente utiliza 19.5 millones de barriles de petróleo y 627 200 millones de metros cúbicos de gas natural.[123]​[146]​ Por otro lado, en el país se encuentran el 27 % de las reservas mundiales de carbón.[147]​ Por décadas, la energía nuclear ha jugado un papel limitado en la producción de energía, en comparación con la mayoría de los países desarrollados, debido en parte a la reacción pública después del accidente de Three Mile Island. Sin embargo, en 2007 el gobierno recibió múltiples peticiones para la construcción de nuevas centrales nucleares, lo que podría significar una disminución considerable en el consumo de combustibles fósiles[148]​ y un cambio en la política energética.\n\nEn el último censo decenal del país (2020), la cifra asciende a 331 449 281 de habitantes en abril de 2020 según la Oficina Nacional del Censo.[149]​ Esta cifra incluye un estimado de 11.2 millones de inmigrantes ilegales,[150]​ pero excluye la población de cinco territorios no incorporados (Puerto Rico, Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos, Guam, Samoa americana e Islas Marianas del Norte). Esto la convierte en la tercera nación más poblada en el mundo, después de China y la India. Además, Estados Unidos es la única nación industrializada donde se prevé un aumento significativo en la población.[151]​ Con una tasa de natalidad de 13.82 bebés por cada 1000 habitantes (30 % por debajo de la media mundial), su tasa de crecimiento demográfico es de 0.98 %, significativamente más alto que los de Europa occidental, Japón y Corea del Sur.[152]​ En el año fiscal de 2009, 1.1 millones de inmigrantes obtuvieron la residencia legal.[153]​ México ha sido el principal país de origen de los nuevos residentes durante más de dos décadas; desde 1998, China, India y Filipinas también se han destacado en este sentido cada año.[154]​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene una población muy diversa: treinta y un diferentes grupos étnicos cuentan con más de un millón de representantes.[155]​ Los blancos estadounidenses son el grupo étnico más grande; los germano-estadounidenses, los hiberno-estadounidenses y los angloamericanos constituyen tres de los cuatro grupos étnicos más numerosos del país.[155]​ Los afroamericanos son la «minoría» racial más importante y el tercer grupo étnico más grande.[155]​[156]​ Los asiáticos son la segunda «minoría» racial con mayor presencia; dentro de este grupo destacan los grupos de origen chino y filipino.[155]​ En 2008, la población incluía un estimado de 6 millones de personas con ascendencia indígena, ya sea de un pueblo amerindio (1.8 millones), alaskeño (3.1 millones), hawaiano (500 000) o de una isla del Pacífico (600 000).[156]​\n\nEl crecimiento de la población de origen latinoamericano es una importante tendencia demográfica. De acuerdo a la Oficina Nacional del Censo, los 46.9 millones de descendientes de latinos o hispanos[156]​ son un grupo heterogéneo que comparten una distinta «etnicidad», así 64 % de los hispanos son de ascendencia mexicana.[157]​ Entre 2000 y 2008, la población hispana aumentó 32 %, mientras que la población no hispana aumentó solo un 4.3 %.[156]​ Gran parte de este crecimiento es debido a la inmigración, por ejemplo, en 2007 el 12.6 % de la población estadounidense había nacido en el extranjero, de los cuales, el 54 % nacieron en América Latina.[158]​ La tasa de fecundidad también es un factor: la mujer hispana promedio da a luz a tres niños, mientras que las mujeres negras tienen 2.2 y las mujeres blancas 1.8.[151]​ Las minorías (definidas por la Oficina del Censo como todos aquellos que no son hispanos o blancos) constituyen el 34 % de la población y se prevé que constituirán la mayoría para el 2042.[159]​\n\nAlrededor del 82 % de los estadounidenses viven en zonas urbanas (tal como las define la Oficina del Censo, estas áreas incluyen los suburbios);[136]​ cerca de la mitad residen en ciudades con una población superior a cincuenta mil habitantes.[160]​ En 2008, 273 localidades contaban con más de cien mil personas, nueve ciudades tenían más de un millón de residentes y cuatro ciudades globales tenían más de dos millones de residentes (Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Chicago y Houston).[161]​ Existen cincuenta y dos áreas metropolitanas con más de un millón de habitantes.[162]​ De las cincuenta áreas metropolitanas de más rápido crecimiento demográfico, cuarenta y siete se encuentran en el oeste y en el sur.[163]​ Las áreas metropolitanas de Dallas, Houston, Atlanta y Phoenix aumentaron su población en más de un millón de personas entre 2000 y 2008.[162]​\n\nLa educación pública estadounidense es operada por los gobiernos estatales y locales, regulados por el Departamento de Educación de los Estados Unidos. Es obligatorio que los niños asistan a la escuela desde los seis o siete años (por lo general, al jardín de niños o al primer grado de educación primaria) hasta que cumplen los dieciocho años (generalmente hasta cursar el duodécimo grado, el final de la escuela secundaria); algunos estados permiten a los estudiantes abandonar la escuela a los dieciséis o diecisiete años.[164]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los niños están inscritos en escuelas privadas, mientras que el 2 % recibe educación en el hogar.[165]​ Existen múltiples instituciones privadas y públicas de educación superior, así como de colleges comunitarios con las políticas de admisión abierta. De las personas mayores de veinticinco años, el 84.6 % se graduó de la escuela secundaria, un 52.6 % asistió a algún college, el 27.2 % obtuvo una licenciatura y el 9.6 % obtuvo un título de posgrado.[166]​ La tasa de alfabetización es de aproximadamente un 99 %.[136]​ La ONU le asigna al país un índice de educación de 0.97, el 12.º más alto en el mundo.[167]​ De acuerdo a la Unesco, Estados Unidos es el segundo país con más instituciones de educación superior en el mundo, con un total de 5758 y un promedio de más de 15 por cada estado.[168]​ El país también cuenta con el mayor número de estudiantes universitarios en el mundo, ascendiendo a 14 261 778, es decir, casi el 4.75 % de la población total.[169]​ Finalmente, aquí se encuentran algunas de las universidades más prestigiosas y de mayor fama en todo el mundo. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford y el Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts son consideradas como las mejores universidades por varias publicaciones.[170]​[171]​[172]​\n\nEl inglés es el idioma nacional de facto. Aunque no existe ningún idioma oficial a nivel federal, algunas leyes ―como los Requisitos para la Naturalización― colocan al inglés como idioma obligatorio. En 2006, cerca de 241 millones, o sea, el 78 % de la población mayor de cinco años, hablaba únicamente el inglés en casa. El español, hablado por el 13 % de la población, es el segundo idioma más hablado, y el que más comúnmente se aprende como segunda lengua.[173]​[174]​ Algunas personas abogan por convertir el inglés en el idioma oficial, como lo es en al menos 28 estados.[175]​ El hawaiano y el inglés son los idiomas oficiales de Hawái,[176]​ mientras que el siux y el inglés son los de Dakota del Sur.[177]​\n\nAunque carecen de un idioma oficial, Nuevo México tiene leyes que alientan el uso del inglés y el español, de la misma forma que Luisiana lo hace con el inglés y el francés cajún. ​ En otros estados, como en California, la publicación de ciertos documentos oficiales en español es obligatoria.[179]​[180]​ Los territorios insulares garantizan el reconocimiento oficial de los idiomas nativos, junto con el inglés: el samoano y el chamorro son reconocidos por Samoa Americana y Guam, respectivamente; el carolinio y el chamorro son reconocidos por las Islas Marianas del Norte, y el español es un idioma oficial de Puerto Rico.\n\nAdemás de las lenguas mencionadas, se siguen hablando un número elevado de lenguas nativas en numerosas reservas por todo el país y pequeñas localidades. Cada una de estas lenguas cuenta con unos pocos de miles de hablantes, y la más importante demográficamente es el navajo, con casi doscientos mil hablantes nativos.\n\nEstados Unidos es oficialmente un Estado laico; la Primera Enmienda garantiza el libre ejercicio de la religión y prohíbe el establecimiento de cualquier gobierno religioso.[30]​ En un estudio de 2002, el 59 % de los estadounidenses aseguró que la religión desempeñaba un «papel muy importante en sus vidas», una cifra más elevada que la de cualquier otra nación desarrollada.[181]​ De acuerdo con una encuesta de 2007, un 78.4 % de los adultos se identificaron como cristianos,[182]​ registrándose una disminución desde 1990, cuando eran el 86.4 %.[183]​ Las denominaciones protestantes representaban el 51.3 %, mientras que la Iglesia católica con el 23.9 %, era la corriente religiosa más grande. El estudio clasifica a los evangélicos blancos, 26.3 % de la población, como la cohorte religiosa más grande del país;[182]​ otro estudio estima que los evangélicos de todas las razas conforman entre el 30 y 35 % de la población.[184]​ En 1990, el total de adeptos a religiones no cristianas eran el 3.3 %, para 2007 había crecido hasta un 4.7 %.[183]​ Las principales religiones no cristianas eran el judaísmo (1.7 %), el budismo (0.7 %), el islam (0.6 %), el hinduismo (0.4 %) y el unitarismo universalista (0.3 %).[182]​ La encuesta también informó que el 16.1 % de los estadounidenses se describían a sí mismos como agnósticos, ateos o simplemente sin ninguna religión.[182]​[183]​\n\nEn 2006, la esperanza de vida era de 77.8 años,[185]​ siendo un año más corta que el promedio de Europa occidental, y mucho más corta que la de países como Noruega, Suiza y Canadá.[186]​ Durante las últimas dos décadas, el nivel de esperanza de vida cayó del 11.º lugar mundial, hasta el 42.º.[187]​ La mortalidad infantil es de 6.37 fallecimientos por cada 1000 nacidos vivos.[188]​ Aproximadamente un tercio de la población adulta es obesa y otro tercio tiene sobrepeso;[189]​ el índice de obesidad, uno de los más altos del mundo, se ha duplicado en los últimos veinticinco años. ​ La alta incidencia de diabetes tipo 2 relacionada con la obesidad se considera una epidemia por algunos profesionales de la salud.[191]​ El índice de embarazos en la adolescencia asciende a 79.8 por cada 1000 mujeres, cuatro veces el índice de Francia y cinco veces el de Alemania.[192]​ El aborto, legal en algunos casos, es un tema muy controvertido: muchos estados prohibieron la financiación pública del procedimiento, restringieron el aborto cuando el feto ya está desarrollado, requieren notificación parental para las menores y un período de espera. La tasa de aborto está disminuyendo, ya que existen 241 por cada 1000 nacimientos, aunque sigue siendo superior al de la mayoría de las naciones occidentales.[193]​\n\nEl gasto en el sistema de atención a la salud sobrepasa al de cualquier otra nación, tanto en términos de gasto per cápita como en porcentaje del PIB.[194]​ En 2000, la Organización Mundial de la Salud colocó el sistema de salud estadounidense en primer lugar en la capacidad de respuesta, pero 37.º en rendimiento global. Estados Unidos es líder en innovación médica. En 2004, este sector invirtió tres veces más que cualquier país de Europa en la investigación biomédica.[195]​\n\nEstados Unidos es sede de muchos de los mejores centros médicos del mundo. Gran parte de las instalaciones médicas son de propiedad privada que cuentan con algunos subsidios del gobierno local. A pesar de ser asociaciones sin fines de lucro, muchos de los hospitales más importantes del país están afiliados a grandes corporaciones o escuelas de medicina, que han hecho posible que anualmente estos centros alberguen a cerca del 70 % de todos los pacientes médicos del país.[196]​ El Hospital Johns Hopkins, la Clínica Mayo, el Hospital General de Massachusetts y la Clínica Cleveland se encuentran entre los mejores hospitales del país y del mundo.[197]​\n\nA diferencia de otros países desarrollados, la cobertura del sistema de salud no es universal. En 2004, los seguros médicos pagaron el 36 % de los gastos en materia de salud y los gobiernos federales y estatales otorgaron el 44 %.[198]​ En 2005, 46.6 millones de estadounidenses, 15.9 % de la población, no estaban asegurados, 5.4 millones más que en 2001. La principal causa de este aumento es la caída en el número de empleos donde se garantiza el seguro médico.[199]​ El tema de los estadounidenses no asegurados es una cuestión política importante.[200]​[201]​ Un estudio de 2009 estimó que la falta de seguros está asociada con casi 45 000 muertes al año.[202]​ En 2006, Massachusetts se convirtió en el primer estado en implementar la asistencia sanitaria universal.[203]​ La ley federal aprobada a principios de 2010 creará un sistema de salud casi universal para todo el país en 2014.[cita requerida]\n\nDelincuencia y aplicación de la ley\n\nSegún datos de 2020, Estados Unidos tiene una tasa de homicidios intencionales de 7 por cada 100 000 habitantes.[205]​ Un análisis transversal de la base de datos de mortalidad de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2010 mostró que las tasas de homicidio de Estados Unidos fueron 7 veces más altas que en otros países de altos ingresos, impulsadas por una tasa de homicidios con armas de fuego que fue 25.2 veces más alta.[206]​ Entre 1980 y 2008 los hombres cometieron el 77 % de los homicidios y el 90 % de los crímenes. La población negra se vio involucrada en el 52.5 % de los homicidios, una proporción ocho veces mayor que la población blanca (incluyendo a la mayoría de hispanos como «blancos») y fueron víctimas en una proporción seis veces mayor que los blancos. La mayoría de homicidios fueron entre personas de la misma etnia, ya que un 93 % de los negros fueron asesinados por negros y un 84 % de los blancos por blancos.[207]​ De los países desarrollados, Estados Unidos es, con diferencia, el país que tiene un mayor índice de delitos con violencia, homicidios y violencia armada.[208]​ Un análisis de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2003 reveló que Estados Unidos «tenía una tasa de homicidios 6.9 veces superior a las tasas registradas en el resto de los países de ingresos altos, tasa impulsada al alza debido a que su tasa de homicidios por arma de fuego era 19.5 veces mayor».[209]​ El derecho a comprar y portar un arma de fuego, consagrado en la Segunda Enmienda a la Constitución, sigue siendo objeto de debate político y social.\n\nLa responsabilidad legal de aplicar y hacer cumplir las leyes en Estados Unidos recae principalmente en los cuerpos de policía local, en los alguaciles ―llamados sheriff o marshal, dependiendo del estado― y sus departamentos y en la policía estatal. A nivel federal existen varias agencias federales, como la Oficina Federal de Investigación (FBI) y el Cuerpo de Alguaciles de Estados Unidos, especializados en determinadas funciones.[210]​ A nivel federal y en casi todos los estados impera el derecho consuetudinario. En el país existen dos tipos de tribunales, los tribunales estatales, encargados de estudiar y juzgar delitos ordinarios, y los tribunales federales, encargados de juzgar ciertos delitos designados y resolver apelaciones procedentes de sentencias de tribunales estatales. Los acuerdos entre las partes es la forma más común de terminar los juicios, pues en la gran mayoría de casos penales se alcanza un acuerdo con el fiscal antes de celebrarse un juicio con jurado.[211]​[212]​\n\nLa pena de muerte sigue siendo un tipo de condena legalmente, y sigue contemplada para ciertos delitos federales y militares en 32 de los 50 estados del país.[213]​ Entre 1967 y 1977 no se realizó ninguna ejecución, debido, en parte, a un fallo de la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos que prohibía la imposición arbitraria de la pena capital. En 1976, el mismo tribunal dictaminó que, en circunstancias adecuadas, la pena de muerte podía aplicarse sin que ello violara la legalidad constitucional. Desde esta decisión, Estados Unidos ha ejecutado a más de 1300 reos, la mayoría de ellos en Texas, Virginia y Oklahoma.[214]​ Por otro lado, son varios los estados que han ido aboliendo por ley o simplemente dejado de aplicar la pena de muerte. En 2010, Estados Unidos fue el quinto país en número de ejecuciones, detrás de tan solo China, Irán, Corea del Norte y Yemen.[215]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el país con una mayor tasa de encarcelamiento documentado del mundo y tiene la mayor población carcelaria del mundo.[216]​[217]​ A inicios de 2008, más de 2.3 millones de personas estaban encarceladas, más de uno de cada 100 adultos del país.[218]​ Entre presos y personas en libertad condicional, el sistema penitenciario supervisaba a uno de cada 31 adultos del país en 2010,[219]​ cifra que para 2012 se había rebajado a 1 de cada 35 adultos (la tasa más baja desde 1997), haciendo un total de 6 937 600 personas.[220]​ La población carcelaria se ha cuadruplicado desde 1980.[221]​ El coste de mantener a los presos y las instalaciones, sumado a la construcción de nuevas prisiones debido a la masificación, asciende a más de sesenta mil millones de dólares anuales; esto provoca que algunos estados del país tengan que destinar al sistema penitenciario un 10 % de sus ingresos, en el caso de California, estado a la cabeza en número de prisioneros, en el año 2010 dedicó más dinero a esta faceta que, por ejemplo, a educación.[219]​ Los presos más comunes son los varones afroamericanos, con una tasa de encarcelados tres veces mayor que los hispanos y seis veces mayor que la de los varones blancos.[222]​ La alta tasa de presos puede explicarse en parte por las duras leyes promulgadas durante las últimas décadas para combatir el tráfico, posesión y consumo de drogas.[223]​ En 2008 Luisiana fue el estado con mayor tasa de encarcelados y Maine el de menor tasa.[224]​\n\nEl sistema penitenciario de Estados Unidos es duramente criticado tanto por analistas como por algunas organizaciones. Además de la privatización progresiva del sistema penitenciario desde la década de 1980, en 2014 la ONG Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones denunciaron que más de ochenta mil presos se encuentran en celdas de aislamiento minúsculas, que las ONG califican como cámaras de tortura.[225]​ En 2012, The New York Times denunció que unos sesenta mil indocumentados recluidos en centros de detención son utilizados como mano de obra barata por el gobierno o empresas privadas, con salarios que pueden llegar a ser de 13 centavos la hora; en algunos casos ni siquiera se les retribuye.[226]​ Algunos estados también emplean a miles de reclusos de sus prisiones en fábricas de algunas empresas a cambio de la reducción de su condena o el salario mínimo. Esto supone un ahorro para las empresas de millones de dólares al año en salarios, aunque su legalidad está cuestionada.[227]​ Algunas de las empresas involucradas serían, directamente o a través de subcontrataciones, Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks o Victoria’s Secret, entre otras.[227]​\n\nEstados Unidos es una nación multicultural, hogar de una amplia variedad de grupos étnicos, tradiciones y valores.[14]​[228]​ Aparte de las ahora pequeñas poblaciones de nativos americanos y hawaianos, casi todos los estadounidenses o sus antepasados emigraron durante los últimos cinco siglos. ​ La cultura común para la mayoría de los estadounidenses es una cultura occidental, que en gran parte proviene de las tradiciones de los inmigrantes europeos con influencias de muchas otras fuentes, tales como las tradiciones traídas por los esclavos de África.[14]​ ​ ​ Recientemente, los inmigrantes de Asia y Latinoamérica han añadido más elementos a esta mezcla cultural que ha sido descrita como «un crisol de razas homogeneizados y en una ensaladera heterogénea», en donde los inmigrantes y sus descendientes retienen, comparten y absorben varias características culturales distintivas.[14]​\n\nDe acuerdo con un análisis de dimensiones culturales elaborado por Geert Hofstede, Estados Unidos tiene uno de los índices de individualismo más alto que cualquier otro país estudiado.[232]​ Mientras que en la cultura popular se considera al país como una sociedad sin clases sociales, ​ varios estudiosos identifican diferencias significativas que pueden considerarse como clases sociales, que afectan a la socialización, el idioma y los valores.[234]​[235]​ La clase media trabajadora estadounidense ha sido la iniciadora de muchas de las tendencias sociales contemporáneas como el feminismo moderno, el ecologismo y el multiculturalismo.[236]​ A diferencia de otras culturas, la mayoría de las mujeres trabajan fuera del hogar y cuenta con alguna licenciatura.[237]​ En 2007, 58 % de las estadounidenses mayores de 18 años se habían casado, 6 % estaban viudas, 10 % se divorciaron y el 25 % nunca se había casado.[238]​\n\nEl mismo estudio de Hofstede también reveló que el punto de vista social de los estadounidenses, sus expectativas culturales y la imagen que tienen de sí mismos están asociadas con sus empleos y ocupaciones en un grado inusitadamente estrecho.[239]​ Así también se tiene la tendencia a valorar más los logros socioeconómicos, de tal modo que el hecho de ser una persona ordinaria o promedio es visto como un atributo positivo en la mayoría de los casos.[240]​ Pese a que el llamado «sueño americano» y la percepción de que los estadounidenses disfrutan de una alta movilidad social desempeñan un papel clave en la atracción de los inmigrantes, algunos analistas encuentran que Estados Unidos tiene una menor movilidad social que los países de Europa y Canadá.[241]​[242]​\n\nDesde la colonización europea, el arte estadunidense se mantuvo apegado a las corrientes artísticas del Viejo Continente. A mediados del siglo XIX, surgió la Escuela del río Hudson, uno de los primeros movimientos artísticos desarrollado en el país, aunque todavía se encontraba muy influenciado por la tradición europea del naturalismo. En 1913, el Armory Show de la ciudad de Nueva York, una exhibición de obras del arte moderno europeo, causó un gran impacto en el público y transformó la escena artística estadunidense.[243]​ Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley y otros artistas experimentaron con nuevos estilos, mostrando una sensibilidad y técnica sin precedentes en los artistas europeos. Los movimientos artísticos más importantes como el expresionismo abstracto de Jackson Pollock y Willem de Kooning y el pop art de Andy Warhol y Roy Lichtenstein se desarrollaron en gran medida en los Estados Unidos. De igual forma, la corriente del modernismo y el posmodernismo llevaron a la fama a varios arquitectos estadounidenses como Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson y Frank Gehry.\n\nUno de los más grandes promotores del teatro en Estados Unidos fue el empresario P. T. Barnum, quien se introdujo en el negocio del entretenimiento del bajo Manhattan en 1841. A finales de la década de 1870, el equipo Harrigan and Hart produjo una serie de comedias musicales muy exitosas en Nueva York. En el siglo XX, el formato para los musicales modernos emergió de Broadway; las canciones compuestas por personajes como Irving Berlin, Cole Porter y Stephen Sondheim se convirtieron en estándares para la música pop. El dramaturgo Eugene O'Neill ganó el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1936; otros escritores estadounidenses aclamados incluyen a ganadores de un Premio Pulitzer, como Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee y August Wilson.\n\nCoreógrafos como Isadora Duncan y Martha Graham ayudaron al desarrollo de la danza moderna, mientras que George Balanchine y Jerome Robbins fueron dos de las grandes figuras del ballet del siglo XX. Los estadounidenses han jugado un papel importante en el medio artístico de la fotografía, destacando entre ellos Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen y Ansel Adams.\n\nLa primera función de cine en la historia se realizó en 1894 en la ciudad de Nueva York, utilizando el quinetoscopio de Thomas Edison. El año siguiente fue presentada la primera proyección de una película con fines comerciales, también en Nueva York, y durante las décadas siguientes Estados Unidos estuvo a la vanguardia del desarrollo del cine sonoro. Desde principios del siglo XX, la industria del cine estadounidense se ha centrado en gran medida alrededor de las producciones de Hollywood, California. El director D. W. Griffith fue fundamental para el desarrollo de la estructura básica de una película y Citizen Kane (1941) de Orson Welles es citada frecuentemente como la mejor película de todos los tiempos.[244]​[245]​ Otros directores fundamentales de esta nacionalidad en la historia del cine: John Ford, Howard Hawks, Elia Kazan o Michael Curtiz, y, entre los más recientes, Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola o Steven Spielberg. Actores estadounidenses como Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne o Marilyn Monroe se han convertido en figuras icónicas, mientras que el productor y empresario Walt Disney fue uno de los líderes en la animación y el merchandising de sus películas. Los estudios de cine más importantes de Hollywood han producido las películas comercialmente más exitosas en la historia, tales como Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997) o Avatar (2009). Para la década de 2020, los productos de Hollywood continuarán dominando la industria cinematográfica a nivel mundial.[246]​\n\nCon la historieta, la producción estadounidense ha perdido el liderazgo que ostentaba a nivel mundial desde principios del siglo XX, destacando varias tiras de prensa como Flash Gordon, The Phantom o El Príncipe Valiente. Luego de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el cómic se convirtió en un medio minoritario que recientemente vive el fenómeno de la novela gráfica, en el que destacan autores como Charles Burns, Joe Sacco o Chris Ware. No obstante, las tiras cómicas y las historietas también son parte del legado artístico del país. Por ejemplo, Superman, uno de los superhéroes más conocidos dentro de este medio, se ha convertido en todo un ícono nacional. ​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene la mayor cantidad de televidentes en el mundo,[248]​ a la vez que el promedio de tiempo dedicado a ella sigue en aumento, llegando a cinco horas al día en 2006.[249]​ Las cuatro cadenas de televisión más importantes son todas entidades comerciales. Los estadounidenses también escuchan programas de radio, en gran medida comercializados, en promedio durante dos y media horas al día.[250]​ Los sitios web y motores de búsqueda más populares de la red son inventiva estadounidense, incluidos Google, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogger, eBay y Yahoo!.[251]​\n\nEn cuanto a la música, la obra de Charles Ives de la década de 1910, en gran parte ignorada durante su desarrollo, lo llevó a convertirse en el primer compositor de música clásica estadounidense exitoso; otros pioneros como Henry Cowell y John Cage crearon un enfoque estadounidense dentro de las composiciones clásicas. Aaron Copland y George Gershwin desarrollaron una mezcla única de música clásica con música popular.\n\nLos estilos rítmicos y líricos de la música afroamericana han influido profundamente en la música de Estados Unidos en general, distinguiéndola de las tradiciones europeas. Elementos de la música folclórica, como el blues y lo que ahora se conoce como old music fueron adaptados y transformados en géneros populares para una audiencia global. El jazz fue desarrollado por artistas innovadores tales como Louis Armstrong y Duke Ellington a principios del siglo XX. El country surgió en la década de 1920 y el rhythm and blues en la década de 1940. A mediados de la siguiente década, Elvis Presley y Chuck Berry estuvieron entre los pioneros del rock and roll. En la década de 1960, el surgimiento de la carrera de Bob Dylan ayudó a revivir la influencia de la música folclórica, para convertirse en uno de los compositores más célebres del país; al mismo tiempo, James Brown lideró el desarrollo del funk. Las más recientes creaciones estadounidenses incluyen el hip hop y la música house. Finalmente, estrellas de la música popular estadounidense como Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift e Eminem se han convertido en celebridades mundiales. ​\n\nDurante el siglo XVIII y principios del siglo XIX, la literatura estadunidense tomaba la mayoría de sus influencias de Europa. A mediados del siglo XIX, escritores como Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe y Henry David Thoreau establecieron una literatura propia del país. Mark Twain y el poeta Walt Whitman fueron dos de las grandes figuras de la segunda mitad del siglo; Emily Dickinson, virtualmente desconocida durante su vida, también es considerada como una de las poetisas más importantes de la literatura estadounidense. ​ Una obra que captura aspectos fundamentales de la vida en el país en sus personajes ―tales como Moby-Dick (1851) de Herman Melville, Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn (1885) de Mark Twain y El gran Gatsby (1925) de F. Scott Fitzgerald― puede ser considerada como la «gran novela estadounidense».\n\nOnce ciudadanos estadounidenses han ganado el Premio Nobel de Literatura, siendo el más reciente Toni Morrison en 1993. William Faulkner y Ernest Hemingway, ganadores en los años 1949 y 1954, respectivamente, a menudo son catalogados entre los escritores más influyentes del siglo XX. ​ Varios géneros literarios populares como los del viejo oeste y la novela negra se desarrollaron en el país. Los escritores de la generación beat (Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs…) abrieron el campo a nuevas formas literarias, así como a autores posmodernistas como John Barth, Thomas Pynchon y Don DeLillo. Merece la pena mencionar asimismo a otros poetas y escritores tan importantes como Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, el nacionalizado Vladimir Nabokov, Raymond Carver, y, dentro de la literatura fantástica, son de renombre internacional H. P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, etc.\n\nEn el campo de la filosofía, los trascendentalistas, liderados por Henry Thoreau y Ralph Waldo Emerson, establecieron el primer movimiento filosófico importante del país. Después de la Guerra de Secesión, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James y John Dewey fueron los líderes del desarrollo del pragmatismo. En el siglo XX, las obras de W. V. O. Quine, Richard Rorty y Noam Chomsky, trajeron la filosofía analítica a las academias estadounidenses. En décadas más recientes, John Rawls y Robert Nozick fueron dos de los líderes más importantes del resurgimiento de la filosofía política.\n\nLa gastronomía de Estados Unidos es similar a la de otros países occidentales, con el trigo siendo el cereal más utilizado. La cocina tradicional estadunidense utiliza ingredientes como el pavo, carne de ciervo, papas, camotes, maíz, calabazas, miel de maple y otros elementos indígenas utilizados por los amerindios y los primeros colonizadores europeos. Parrilladas de puerco y res, tortas de cangrejo, papas chips y las galletas con chispas de chocolate son algunos de los platos hechos al «estilo estadounidense». La soul food, la cocina tradicional de los esclavos africanos, es aún popular en el sur y entre los afroamericanos de otras partes del país. Las gastronomías sincréticas, como la cocina criolla de Luisiana, la cajún y la tex-mex, tienen gran importancia regional.\n\nPlatos característicos como la tarta de manzana, el pollo frito, la pizza, la hamburguesa y el perrito caliente provienen de recetas introducidas por los inmigrantes. Las papas fritas, los platillos mexicanos como los burritos y tacos y los platillos con pastas adaptados de recetas italianas también son ampliamente consumidos.[255]​ En el consumo de bebidas, los estadounidenses prefieren el café en vez del té. La publicidad de las industrias estadounidenses ha hecho que el jugo de naranja y la leche sean las bebidas típicas de un desayuno. ​ ​ El consumo frecuente de comida rápida está asociado con lo que los médicos llaman «epidemia de obesidad». Las gaseosas son ampliamente populares: el azúcar contenido en ellas aporta el 9 % de la ingesta calórica promedio.[258]​[259]​\n\nEstados Unidos es pionero en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX. En 1876, Alexander Graham Bell recibió la primera patente para un estadounidense por el teléfono.[260]​ El laboratorio de Thomas Edison desarrolló el fonógrafo, la primera lámpara incandescente y el primer proyector de películas. Nikola Tesla fue precursor en experimentar con la corriente alterna, el motor de corriente alterna y la radio. En el siglo XX, las compañías de automóviles de Ransom Eli Olds y Henry Ford promovieron la producción en cadena. En 1903, los hermanos Wright realizaron el primer vuelo propulsado en su aeronave Wright Flyer.[261]​\n\nEl ascenso del nazismo en la década de 1930 llevó a muchos científicos europeos, incluyendo a Albert Einstein y Enrico Fermi, a emigrar al país. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el proyecto Manhattan ya había desarrollado las primeras armas nucleares, anunciando el inicio de la era nuclear. La carrera espacial también produjo avances rápidos en la construcción y el desarrollo de cohetes, la ciencia de materiales y la informática. El país fue responsable del desarrollo de la ARPANET y su sucesor, Internet. Hoy en día, la mayor parte de los ingresos para la investigación y desarrollo, un 64%, provienen del sector privado.[262]​ El país es líder mundial en publicaciones de investigación científica y en el factor de impacto.[263]​ Los estadounidenses poseen bienes de consumo tecnológicamente avanzados[264]​[265]​[266]​ y casi la mitad de los hogares tienen acceso a Internet de banda ancha.[267]​ También es el principal desarrollador y cultivador de organismos genéticamente modificados; más de la mitad de las tierras con cultivos biotecnológicos del mundo se encuentran en Estados Unidos.[268]​\n\nSegún el Índice Mundial de Innovación, a cargo de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, en su versión 2024, Estados Unidos se ubica en el tercer lugar de dicho índice.[269]​ Desde 2023, fue desplazado del segundo lugar que ocupó en 2022, por Suecia.[270]​ [271]​[272]​ En ediciones anteriores a 2022, de este índice, Estados Unidos obtuvo la posición número 3, en los cuales el primer lugar ha sido siempre ocupado por Suiza.[273]​[274]​\n\nDesde finales del siglo XIX, el béisbol se considera como el deporte nacional, mientras que el fútbol americano, el baloncesto y el hockey sobre hielo son los otros tres grandes deportes de conjunto a nivel profesional. Las ligas universitarias también atraen a grandes audiencias. El fútbol americano es el deporte más popular en Estados Unidos.[276]​[277]​ El boxeo y las carreras de caballos fueron en su momento los deportes individuales más vistos, pero han sido eclipsados por el golf y el automovilismo, particularmente por los campeonatos Stock Cars como la más importante Copa NASCAR y otras categorías nacionales y regionales de NASCAR y ARCA. Otros campeonatos de monoplazas reseñables son la IndyCar, anteriormente la desaparecida Championship Auto Racing Teams y las carreras de resistencia como la United SportsCar Championship. Una de las principales carreras de Estados Unidos son las 500 Millas de Indianapolis de la IndyCar, que cuenta con prestigio internacional. Las carreras de resistencia como las 24 Horas de Daytona, 12 Horas de Sebring y la Petit Le Mans son de igual importancia en el automovilismo mundial. Las 500 millas de Daytona de la copa NASCAR es la carrera más importante de los Stock Cars del mundo. El fútbol, aunque no es uno de los principales deportes a nivel profesional en el país, tiene gran presencia y nivel de aficionados. El tenis y otros deportes de exterior también son populares junto al Abierto de Estados Unidos, uno de los campeonatos de tenis más vistos del mundo.\n\nSi bien la mayoría de los deportes importantes de los Estados Unidos han evolucionado de prácticas europeas, el baloncesto, el voleibol, la animación y el snowboarding son invenciones locales. El lacrosse y el surf surgieron de los amerindios y de los nativos de Hawái.\n\nEl Comité Olímpico de los Estados Unidos (USOC) fue anfitrión de los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano en cuatro ocasiones: San Luis 1904, Los Ángeles 1932, Los Ángeles 1984 y Atlanta 1996, y de los Juegos de Invierno en cuatro ocasiones: Lake Placid 1932, Squaw Valley 1960, Lake Placid 1980 y Salt Lake City 2002.[278]​ Estados Unidos organizará los juegos de verano de 2028 en Los Ángeles y los de invierno de 2034 en Salt Lake City. Estados Unidos ha ganado 2781 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano, más que ningún otro país y 330 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno.[279]​\n• Anexo:Patrimonio de la Humanidad en Estados Unidos\n• Anexo:Banderas de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Anexo:Presidentes de los Estados Unidos\n• Estado de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Medios de comunicación en Estados Unidos\n• None .

It was a Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement and a major market town from those times through Norman and medieval times to the present day. It is the seat of the Church of England Diocese of Chichester and is home to a 12th-century cathedral.\n\nThe city has two main watercourses: the Chichester Canal and the River Lavant. The Lavant, a winterbourne, runs to the south of the city walls; it is hidden mostly in culverts when close to the city centre.\n\nThere is no recorded evidence that Chichester was a settlement of any size before the coming of the Romans.[6] The area around Chichester is believed to have played a significant part during the Roman invasion of AD 43, as confirmed by evidence of military storage structures in the area of the nearby Fishbourne Roman Palace.[7] The city centre stands on the foundations of the Romano-British city of Noviomagus Reginorum, capital of the Civitas Reginorum.[8][9]\n\nThe Roman road of Stane Street, connecting the city with London, started at the east gate, while the Chichester to Silchester road started from the north gate. The plan of the city is inherited from the Romans: the North, South, East and West shopping streets radiate from the central market cross dating from medieval times.\n\nThe original Roman city wall was over 6+1⁄2 feet (2.0 m) thick with a steep ditch (which was later used to divert the River Lavant). The lower parts of the existing city walls are Roman, but most of the above-ground work is later.\n\nThe city was also home to some Roman baths, found down Tower Street when preparation for a new car park was underway. A museum, The Novium, preserving the baths was opened on 8 July 2012.\n\nAn amphitheatre was built outside the city walls, close to the East Gate, in around 80 AD. The area is now a park, but the site of the amphitheatre is discernible as a gentle bank approximately oval in shape; a notice board in the park gives more information.\n\nIn January 2017, archaeologists using underground radar reported the discovery of the relatively untouched ground floor of a Roman townhouse and outbuilding. The exceptional preservation is due to the fact the site, Priory Park, belonged to a monastery and has never been built upon since Roman times.[10]\n\nThe legendary foundation of Anglo-Saxon Chichester is described by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that says that the area was annexed towards the close of the fifth century, by Ælle and his three sons. The city was supposedly renamed after his son, Cissa. It also says that it was the principal city of the Kingdom of Sussex. However, the foundation story is regarded as a myth by historians as there is no archaeological evidence that Chichester was reoccupied after the Romans left until the 9th century.[11][12]\n\nIn the 9th century Alfred the Great set about building a system of fortified towns or forts, known as burhs, in response to the Viking threat. This included old Roman settlements where the walls could be rebuilt and strengthened. Chichester was one of these and was rebuilt probably between 878 and 879. The Burghal Hidage is an Anglo-Saxon document that provides a list of over thirty burhs, mainly in the ancient Kingdom of Wessex, and the taxes (recorded as numbers of hides) assigned for their maintenance. For each five hides the town was expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep. Chichester was one of the larger burhs and was rated at 1500 hides.[13][14]\n\nThe system was supported by a communication network based on hilltop beacons to provide early warning. It has been suggested that one such link ran from Chichester to London.[15][16]\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest in 1066, the cathedral that had been founded in 681 at Selsey was moved to Chichester after the Council of London of 1075 decreed that Sees should be centred in cities.[17]\n\nWhen the Domesday Book of 1086 was compiled, Cicestre[18] in the Hundred of Stockbridge (comprising 102 households across the five areas outside the city)[19] comprised 300 dwellings which held a population of 1,500 people, and had an annual value of 25 pounds. There was a mill named Kings Mill that would have been rented to local slaves and villeins. After the Battle of Hastings the township of Chichester was handed to Roger de Mongomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, for courageous efforts in the battle, but it was forfeited in 1104 by the 3rd Earl. Shortly after 1066 Chichester Castle was built by Roger de Mongomerie to consolidate Norman power.[20] In around 1143 the title Earl of Arundel (also known as the Earl of Sussex until that title fell out of use) was created and became the dominant local landowner. In 1216, Chichester Castle, along with Reigate Castle, was captured by the French, but regained the following year, when the castle was ordered to be destroyed by the king.[21] Between 1250 and 1262, the Rape of Chichester was created from the western half of Arundel rape, with the castle as its administrative centre.[22]\n\nIn about 1400 Bishop Robert Reed erected a cross in the Market Place.[23]\n\nAt Christmas 1642 during the First English Civil War, the city was besieged and St Pancras church was destroyed by gunfire.[24]\n\nA military presence was established in the city in 1795 with the construction of a depot on land where the Hawkhurst Gang had been hanged. It was named the Roussillon Barracks in 1958.[25]\n\nThe military presence had mostly ceased by 2014 and the site was being developed for housing.[26] with the former Guardroom known as The Keep playing host to a detachment of the Army Cadet Force.[27]\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th-century, Chichester's livestock market was recorded as the second largest in the country.[28]\n\nChichester was bombed by the Luftwaffe during World War II, but fared relatively well compared to larger English cities.[29][30] On 11 May 1944, a United States Army Air Forces Consolidated B-24 Liberator crashed in the city, killing three, injuring 38, and damaging hundreds of local buildings.[31]\n\nA new West Sussex county library was built in Tower Street in 1967, designed by county architect FR Steele. This was listed at Grade II in 2015.[32]\n\nIn December 1993 and January 1994, Chichester was affected by the 1993–94 West Sussex floods.[33]\n\nOn 21 November 2017, the Chichester District Council adopted a 'Southern Gateway' plan to redevelop an area from the law courts to the canal basin, including the two railway level crossings.[34][35]\n\nHistorically, Chichester was a city and liberty,[6] thereby largely self-governing. Although it has retained its city status, in 1888 it became a municipal borough, transferring some powers to West Sussex administrative county. In 1974 the municipal borough became part of the much larger Chichester District. The City Council[36] was retained but it only has the powers of a parish council; control of services is largely in the hands of Chichester District Council and West Sussex County Council.\n\nThe City Council meets in the Council House on North Street, which dates from 1731.[37] Prior to this the City Council, and its predecessor the City Corporation, had met in Chichester Guildhall. In addition to its own council offices, those of the Chichester District and the West Sussex County Council are located in the city.\n\nThe City Council consists of eighteen elected members serving five wards of the city – North, South, East, West, and Central.[38] Elections to the City Council last took place on Thursday 5 May 2023.[39] The current makeup of the City Council is shown below - those marked * are also Chichester District Councillors.\n\nChichester is represented in the House of Commons by the Chichester constituency, held since the 2024 General Election by Jess Brown-Fuller.[40] From 1660 to 1868, Chichester returned two members of Parliament, this was reduced to one member by the Reform Act 1867. The Conservative Party is dominant, with the constituency returning a Conservative member at every election since 1868, with the exception of the Liberal Charles Rudkin in 1923. Between 1812 and 1894 the constituency was represented exclusively by members of the Lennox family.[41]\n\nThe following people and organisations have received the Freedom of the City of Chichester.\n\nThe City of Chichester is located on the River Lavant south of its gap through the South Downs. This winterbourne for part of its course now runs through the city in underground culverts.[51] The city's site made it an ideal place for settlement, with many ancient routeways converging here. The oldest section lies within the medieval walls of the city, which are built on Roman foundations.[52]\n\nThe Chichester conservation area, designated for its architectural and historic interest,[53] encompasses the whole of the Roman town, and includes many Grade I and II listed buildings. Further to the north lies the separate conservation area around the former Graylingwell Hospital, and to the south, the Chichester Conservation Area has been extended recently to include the newly restored canal basin and part of Chichester Canal itself. The Conservation Area has been split into eight 'character' areas, based on historic development, building type, uses and activities.\n\nChichester has a maritime climate. With its position in southern England, Chichester has mild winters and cool summers. West Sussex has high sunshine levels compared with other parts of the UK with around 1,900 hours annually.[54]\n\nThe 2011 census recorded a population of 26,795 for the city of Chichester, forming 12,316 households.[55] The 2021 census recorded an increase in population to 29,407, forming 13,263 households. There is a small imbalance in the sex ratio, with 15,701, female residents (53.3%) and 13,706 male residents (46.7%). 26,622 residents (91%) listed their ethnic group as white.[2]\n\nChichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.[56]\n\nThe city has a tourist industry.[57] Several marinas are situated in the area together with related industries. A recent government study suggested that the area has a lot of employment with the public sector (as well as within the tourism and leisure industries), with a growing number of self-employed people in the area.[58]\n\nThe city holds an annual four-week arts and music festival (\"Festival of Chichester\") held in June and July.[59]\n\nChichester Cathedral has a year-round programme of music, talks and other events, including free lunchtime concerts of classical music.\n\nChichester Festival Theatre, is one of the United Kingdom's flagship producing and touring theatres, whose annual summer season attracts actors, writers and directors from the West End theatre and the USA.[60]\n\nPallant House Gallery, winner of the 2007 gallery of the year Gulbenkian Prize, has a major collection of chiefly modern British art and in 2006 opened a new extension that houses the collection of Sir Colin St John Wilson. It has a changing programme of exhibitions.[61]\n\nChichester is home to the South Downs Planetarium & Science Centre, which opened in 2001 and features a program of public star shows in its 100-seat theatre.\n\nThe Sloe Fair, a funfair that dates back to the 12th Century, is held annually on 20 October in the city's Northgate car park.[62]\n\nChichester Cinema at New Park[63] is the city's first and only arthouse cinema. It shows a selection of mainstream, small-budget and older films 7 days a week. It hosts an annual 18-day International Film Festival in August/September. Vice-presidents are Maggie Smith and Kenneth Branagh. There is a larger, multiplex cinema located at Chichester Gate. Chichester's previous cinemas were the Olympia Electric on Northgate (1911–1922), the Plaza Cinema on South Street (1920–1960, the Odeon from 1945 and now Iceland supermarket), the Granada Exchange at the Corn Exchange (1922–1980) and the Gaumont on Eastgate Square (1937–1961, later the swimming baths).[64]\n\nThe Chichester Open Mic has supported regular programmes of readings by contemporary poets in the city since 2010. It also hosts a high-profile annual event under the banner Poetry and All That Jazz which included performances by Don Paterson in 2010, Sam Willetts in 2011, and David Harsent in 2012.[65]\n\nIn 2012 The Novium, Chichester's museum, was opened by author Kate Mosse.[66] Designed by the architect Keith Williams, is approximately 2.4 times the size of the previous museum in Little London. Key highlights are Roman Bath House, Jupiter Stone and Chilgrove Mosaic.\n\nIn May 2013 Chichester hosted the Chichester Street Art Festival week where international street artists created colourful murals around the city.[67]\n\nChichester is mentioned in a 1992 episode of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, the 2003 film Bright Young Things directed by Stephen Fry, the 2005 film Stoned about Brian Jones from the Rolling Stones, and also in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes. The city is periodically referred to in Call the Midwife, as the seat of the Order of Saint Raymond Nonnatus, the mother house's exterior being depicted in episode 1.6.\n\nThe West Sussex Record Office is in Orchard Street and contains the county archives. On 21 April 2017 it was announced that a second parchment manuscript copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, now termed The Sussex Declaration, had been discovered in the archives.[68][69]\n\nChichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.[56]\n\nFounded in 1881, the Chichester Symphony Orchestra has both amateur and professional players. Three concerts are given each year with the summer concert being part of the Chichester Festivities while the autumn concert is included in the Chichester Cathedral Lunchtime Series.[70] The Chichester Singers, under musical director Jonathan Willcocks, perform classical and contemporary works in concert.[71][72]\n\nThe Chichester RAJF (From \"Real Ale and Jazz Festival\"), was a four-day festival of music and real ale held each July in tents beside the 13th century Guildhall in Priory Park.[73] Founded in 1980 by members of Chichester Hockey Club as a fund-raising event, the festival's early years focused on traditional jazz and featured performers such as Kenny Ball, Humphrey Lyttelton and Kenny Baker. In the 1990s blues and R&B were introduced and acts including Status Quo, Blondie, Boney M, Howard Jones, Go West, The Pretenders and Simple Minds played the festival up until its final staging, in 2011.[citation needed]\n\nThe City of Chichester has been twinned with Chartres, France, since February 1959 and Ravenna, Italy, since December 1996[74][75] and Speyer, Germany, since 2023.[76] Friendship links have also been established with Marktredwitz in Germany, Kursk in Russia and Valletta in Malta.[75]\n\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter.[77]\n\nChichester's local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.8 FM, Heart South on 96.7 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex on 96.6 FM and community based radio stations V2 Radio which broadcast online and Chichester Hospital Radio that broadcast on 1431 AM from the St Richard's Hospital in the town.[78][79]\n\nThe city is served by the weekly newspaper Chichester Observer.[80]\n\nChichester Cross, which is a type of buttercross familiar in old market towns, was built in 1501 as a covered marketplace,[81] and stands at the intersection of the four main roads in the centre of the city.\n\nChichester Cathedral, formally known as the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester. It is a Grade I listed building from 1075.\n\nThe Butter Market in North Street was designed by John Nash, and was opened in 1808 as a food and produce market.[82]\n\nThe Corn Exchange on East Street was built in 1833, one of the first in the country.[83] From the 1880s it was used for drama and entertainment and became a cinema from the 1910s.[84] An attempt to convert it to a bingo hall was refused in 1977.[85] As it could not be converted to a multiplex it was closed on 9 August 1980.[85] It remained closed and unused for six years until the front was opened as a fast food restaurant and the rear converted for offices.[85][86] From 2005 the front has been used by a clothing retailer.[87]\n\nIn 1921, Sir William Robertson unveiled a war memorial in Eastgate Square for soldiers who died in World War I. The memorial was relocated to Litten Gardens in 1940. The city council subsequently added the names of soldiers who died in World War II.[88]\n\nChichester railway station, on the West Coastway line, has regular services to Brighton, London Victoria via Gatwick Airport, Portsmouth and Southampton.\n\nIn the past, there was a branch line to Midhurst in the north and a light railway, built by Colonel H. F. Stephens; it was known as the West Sussex Railway, which ran south to Selsey, and closed in 1935.\n\nChichester is the hub of several main roads. The most important of these is the A27 coastal trunk road, which connects Eastbourne with Southampton; it passes to the south of the city. The A27 connects Chichester to the M3, M27 and M275 motorways. The secondary coastal road, the A259, which begins its journey at Folkestone in Kent, joins the A27 here and ends in Havant to the west. Both of those roads make east–west connections.\n\nThree roads give Chichester access to the north: the A29 to London joins the A27 several miles to the east of the city; the A285 runs north-east to Petworth and beyond; and the A286 runs northwards towards Haslemere, Surrey.[89]\n\nChichester bus station, which is adjacent to the railway station, is the local hub for bus services. Operators include Stagecoach in the South Downs and Compass Travel.[90][91]\n\nChichester/Goodwood Airport is situated north of the city.[89]\n\nThere are several long-distance routes for walkers, cyclists and riders in the area; some of these routes, like the Centurion Way to West Dean, start here. Centurion Way was opened in the mid-1990s and runs along the former railway line.

It offers a range of A-Level and vocational courses. Bishop Luffa School sixth form also offers a range of A-Level courses and Chichester College, formerly Chichester College of Arts, Science and Technology; offers both foundation-level and degree-equivalent courses, mainly focused towards vocational qualifications for industry.[citation needed]\n\nThe University of Chichester[95] was granted degree-awarding body status by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in October 2005.[96]\n\nChichester Cathedral, founded in the 11th century, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and contains a shrine to Saint Richard of Chichester. Its spire, built of the weak local stone, collapsed and was rebuilt during the 19th century. In the south aisle of the cathedral a glass panel in the floor enables a view of the remains of a Roman mosaic pavement. The cathedral is unusual in Britain in having a separate bell tower a few metres away from the main building, rather than integrated into it. Within the cathedral there is a medieval tomb of a knight and his wife, the inspiration of the poem \"An Arundel Tomb\", by Philip Larkin. A memorial statue exists of William Huskisson, once member of parliament for the city, but best remembered as the first man to be run over by a railway engine.[97] Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms were commissioned for the cathedral.\n\nIn addition to the cathedral there are five Church of England churches, St Richard's Roman Catholic church and nine religious buildings of other denominations.[98] Redundant churches include the Grade I-listed St John the Evangelist's Church, an octagonal white-brick proprietary chapel with an impressive three-decker pulpit.[99][100]\n\nSt Mary's Hospital Almshouses are a 13th-century religious foundation located at St Martin's Square, providing housing and care for elderly people from the Chichester diocese.[101]\n\nChichester City F.C. is the main football club and is based at Oaklands Park. They play in the Isthmian League South East Division.[102] The rugby club, Chichester R.F.C., is also based at Oaklands Park.[103]\n\nChichester is also host to a Detachment of the Army Cadet Force who meet several times a week at the detachment located within the former Roussilon Barracks.[108][109]\n\nThe city is home to the Chichester Sharks Flag American Football Club who are members of the BAFA National League.[110]\n\nChichester Runners and A.C. is a club with runners and athletes of all ages. Other sports include cycling.[111]\n\nWilliam Juxon, born 1582, attended The Prebendal School before studying at Oxford. He became chaplain to Charles I and was the last English cleric to hold both church and secular high office. He became Archbishop of Canterbury following the Restoration.[112] William Cawley, born 1602 in Chichester, was on the other side of the English Civil War. Also educated at Oxford University he became the Member of Parliament for Chichester in 1628 and for Midhurst in 1640. He was a regicide and served on the Council of State during the Commonwealth, being forced to flee to Switzerland after the Restoration.[113] A later MP for the town, William Huskisson was the first widely reported person to die in a railway accident, when he was run over by Stephenson's Rocket at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In modern times middle-distance runner Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in 1969.[114]\n\nMilitary people have included Edric Gifford, 3rd Baron Gifford who won a Victoria Cross during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War. General Charles Harington Harington served in the Second Boer War and as a staff officer throughout World War I,[115] and military theorist Major General J. F. C. Fuller planned the first large scale tank assault at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917.[116]\n\nArtists who were born or lived most of their lives in Chichester include Richard Buckner, Heywood Hardy, James Hayllar, William Shayer and George Smith.[117][118] Author Kate Mosse (born 1961) studied at Chichester High School For Girls, living in Chichester until moving to Oxford to attend New College. She is author of the first main-stage new play by a woman at Chichester Festival Theatre, an adaptation of her novel The Taxidermist's Daughter, set in and around Chichester.[119]\n\nTim Peake, who became the first official British astronaut when he arrived on the International Space Station in December 2015, was born in Chichester in 1972.

Fresh, healthful, and pure. With a focus on ingredients that are natural and sustainable; both sourced locally and imported from the sun-kissed islands and rugged mountains of Greece. Greca Mediterranean Kitchen + Bar is a concept 2,500 years in the making; steeped in tradition while exploring new creative paths forged from those traditions. Fresh fish flown from the Aegean is featured alongside succulent char-grilled meats that are at the center of a Greek festive table. Octopus, tender and rich, is served over a bed of Santorini fava (yellow lentil spread) with local tomatoes and red onions; tzatziki made with locally-sourced yogurt produced by a third-generation Greek dairy farmer is lovingly made in the authentic way (strained through cheesecloth); and loukaniko (village pork sausage) is infused with orange peel, as is the custom in the Peloponnese.\n\n In Greek culture, food is at the center of our lives, with every home producing it’s own culinary genius, very often known by the name “yiayia”. Among Greeks, food is made with love, with great thought and care given to each ingredient. Food is an extension of hospitality, a concept so important to Greeks that the word’s literal translation is “love of strangers”. For us, each meal, then, is a celebration; bringing together loved ones, old friends and new friends. Shared plates (whether meze or feasting platters), bottles of wine and cocktails crafted from the unique spirit heritage of Greece, are an invitation to commune with one another; to laugh, sing, imbibe and savor."}

Fue identificado como objeto nebuloso por primera vez por Edmond Halley en 1677. Este cúmulo orbita a través de nuestra galaxia, la Vía Láctea, siendo el más grande y brillante de los cúmulos globulares que la orbitan, su masa es de 4 millones de masas solares.[1]​ Omega Centauri también es el segundo cúmulo globular más masivo del grupo local de galaxias, solo Mayall II es más masivo. Es uno de los pocos (y el más brillante) que pueden ser observados a simple vista desde la Tierra. Omega Centauri está a unos 17 000 años luz (5 212.22 pc) de la Tierra y contiene varios millones de estrellas de Población II. Las estrellas de su centro están tan próximas entre sí que se cree que se encuentran a tan solo 0,1 años luz las unas de las otras. Su edad estimada es de cerca de 12 000 millones de años. Contiene alrededor de 10 millones de estrellas.\n\nA pesar de no ser realmente una estrella de la constelación del Centauro, recibió la letra griega ω en la denominación de Bayer como si lo fuera. Una característica que lo distingue de los demás cúmulos globulares de nuestra galaxia es que contiene estrellas de distintas generaciones. Por este motivo se especula que Omega Centauri puede ser el remanente del núcleo de una galaxia enana que fue satélite de nuestra Vía Láctea. Esta galaxia tendría un tamaño cientos de veces superior al actual de Omega Centauri y fue disgregada y absorbida por nuestra galaxia. La química y la dinámica de Omega Centauri son consistentes con esta hipótesis.\n\nAl igual que Mayall II, Omega Centauri presenta un rango de metalicidades y de edades estelares que llevan a pensar que no se formó de una sola vez (al contrario de lo que es normal en la mayoría de los cúmulos globulares).[2]​\n\nCuando se observa a simple vista en un sitio muy oscuro se puede ver del tamaño de la Luna llena[3]​ en el hemisferio sur, es circumpolar desde la latitud 43° sur y por lo tanto solo se eleva sobre el horizonte en el hemisferio norte hasta la latitud 43° norte (latitud de Toronto).\n\nEn 150 d. C., Ptolomeo catalogó este objeto estelar en su Almagesto como \"una estrella en el lomo del caballo\", (Quae est in principio scapulae). En 1603, Johann Bayer, en su Uranometria, utilizó los datos de Ptolomeo para denominarla Omega Centauri.[4]​ En 1677, Edmond Halley lo catalogó como objeto no-estelar en las observaciones que el astrónomo inglés realizó desde la isla de Santa Helena. Posteriormente, en 1715, Halley dijo de él que era una de las seis manchas o puntos luminosos en Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[5]​[6]​\n\nEn 1746, J.P. de Cheseaux la incluyó en su lista de 21 nebulosas. En 1755, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille le dio el número de catálogo L I.5. En 1826, James Dunlop lo reconoció como cúmulo globular y lo describió como un «bello globo estelar cuyas estrellas se concentraban de forma moderada y muy gradual hacia el centro».[6]​[7]​ como hizo el astrónomo francés Lacaille en 1755, de ahí que el número de catálogo se designe L I.5 .[8]​ Fue reconocido por primera vez como cúmulo globular por el astrónomo escocés James Dunlop en 1826, quien lo describió como un \"hermoso globo de estrellas muy gradual y moderadamente comprimido hacia el centro\".[9]​[10]​\n\nA una distancia aproximada de 17090 años luz (5,240 parsecs) de la Tierra, Omega Centauri es uno de los pocos cúmulos globulares visibles a simple vista, y parece casi tan grande como la Luna llena cuando se ve desde una zona rural oscura.[11]​ Es el más brillante, el más grande y, con 4 millones de masa solares,[12]​ el cúmulo globular más masivo conocido asociado a la Vía Láctea. De todos los cúmulos globulares del Grupo Local de galaxias, sólo Mayall II en la Galaxia de Andrómeda es más brillante y masivo.[13]​ Orbitando a través de la Vía Láctea, Omega Centauri contiene varios millones de estrellas de Población II y tiene unos 12 000 millones de años.[14]​\n\nLas estrellas del núcleo de Omega Centauri están tan amontonadas que se calcula que se encuentran a una distancia media de sólo 0,1 años luz unas de otras.[14]​ La dinámica interna se ha analizado utilizando mediciones de las velocidades radiales de 469 estrellas.[15]​ Los miembros de este cúmulo orbitan alrededor del centro de masa con una dispersión de velocidad máxima de 7,9 km s-1. La distribución de masa inferida a partir de la cinemática está ligeramente más extendida que la distribución de luminosidad, aunque no es fuertemente inconsistente con ella.\n\nUn estudio de 2008 presentó evidencia de un agujero negro de masa intermedia en el centro de Omega Centauri, basado en observaciones realizadas por el Telescopio Espacial Hubble y el Observatorio Gemini en Cerro Pachón en Chile.[16]​[17]​ La cámara avanzada para muestreos del Hubble mostró que las estrellas se agrupan cerca del centro de Omega Centauri, como lo demuestra el aumento gradual de la luz estelar cerca del centro. Usando instrumentos en el Observatorio Gemini para medir la velocidad de las estrellas que se arremolinan en el núcleo del cúmulo, E. Noyola y sus colegas encontraron que las estrellas más cercanas al núcleo se mueven más rápido que las estrellas más lejanas. Esta medida se interpretó en el sentido de que la materia invisible en el núcleo está interactuando gravitacionalmente con las estrellas cercanas. Al comparar estos resultados con modelos estándar, los astrónomos concluyeron que la causa más probable era la atracción gravitacional de un objeto denso y masivo como un agujero negro. Calcularon la masa del objeto en 40.000 masas solares.[16]​\n\nSin embargo, un trabajo más reciente ha desafiado estas conclusiones, en particular, disputando la ubicación propuesta del centro del cúmulo.[18]​[19]​ Los cálculos que utilizaron una ubicación revisada para el centro encontraron que la velocidad de las estrellas del núcleo no varía con la distancia, como se esperaría si estuviera presente un agujero negro de masa intermedia. Los mismos estudios también encontraron que la luz de las estrellas no aumenta hacia el centro, sino que permanece relativamente constante. Los autores señalaron que sus resultados no descartan por completo el agujero negro propuesto por Noyola y sus colegas, pero no lo confirman, y limitan su masa máxima a 12.000 masas solares.\n\nSe ha especulado que Omega Centauri es el núcleo de una galaxia enana que fue perturbada y absorbida por la Vía Láctea.[20]​ De hecho, se cree que la Estrella de Kapteyn, que actualmente se encuentra a sólo 13 años luz de la Tierra, tiene su origen en Omega Centauri.[21]​ La química y el movimiento de Omega Centauri en la Vía Láctea también concuerdan con esta imagen.[21]​ La química y el movimiento de Omega Centauri en la Vía Láctea también son coherentes con esta imagen.[21]​ Al igual que Mayall II, Omega Centauri tiene un rango de metalicidades y edades estelares que sugiere que no se formó todo a la vez (como se cree que se forman los cúmulos globulares) y que, de hecho, puede ser el resto del núcleo de una galaxia más pequeña incorporada hace tiempo a la Vía Láctea.[22]​\n\nLa novela Singularity (2012), de Ian Douglas, presenta como un hecho que Omega Centauri y Kapteyn's Star se originan en una galaxia enana perturbada, y este origen es central en la trama de la novela. A medida que avanza la historia, se discuten varios aspectos científicos de Omega Centauri, como el probable entorno de radiación dentro del cúmulo y el aspecto que podría tener el cielo desde el interior del cúmulo.[23]​\n\nEste cúmulo aparece en la serie de ciencia ficción alemana Perry Rhodan, y un ciclo de la serie derivada Atlan, está ambientado en Omega Centauri.\n• Omega Centauri en ESA/Hubble (inglés).

Located at a distance of 17,090 light-years (5,240 parsecs), it is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years.[10] It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars, with a total mass of 4 million solar masses,[11] making it the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way.\n\nOmega Centauri is very different from most other galactic globular clusters to the extent that it is thought to have originated as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.[12]\n\nAround 150 AD, Greco-Roman writer and astronomer Ptolemy catalogued this object in his Almagest as a star on the centaur's back, \"Quae est in principio scapulae\". German cartographer Johann Bayer used Ptolemy's data to designate this object \"Omega Centauri\" with his 1603 publication of Uranometria.[13] Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley observed this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1716, it was published by Halley among his list of six \"luminous spots or patches\" in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[14][15]\n\nSwiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux included Omega Centauri in his 1746 list of 21 nebulae,[15][16] as did French astronomer Lacaille in 1755, whence the catalogue number is designated L I.5.[17] It was first recognized as a globular cluster by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop in 1826, who described it as a \"beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre\".[18][19]\n\nAt a distance of about 17,000 light-years (5,200 parsecs) from Earth, Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye—and appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area.[20] It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses,[6] the most massive-known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II in the Andromeda Galaxy is brighter and more massive.[21] Orbiting through the Milky Way, Omega Centauri contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old.[22]\n\nThe stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light-year away from each other.[22] The internal dynamics have been analyzed using measurements of the radial velocities of 469 stars.[23] The members of this cluster are orbiting the center of mass with a peak velocity dispersion of 7.9 km s−1. The mass distribution inferred from the kinematics is slightly more extended than, though not strongly inconsistent with, the luminosity distribution.[citation needed]\n\nA 2008 study presented evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of Omega Centauri, based on observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pachón in Chile.[24][25] Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys showed that stars are bunching up near the center of Omega Centauri, as evidenced by the gradual increase in starlight near the center. Using instruments at the Gemini Observatory to measure the speed of stars swirling in the cluster's core, E. Noyola and colleagues found that stars closer to the core are moving faster than stars farther away. This measurement was interpreted to mean that unseen matter at the core is interacting gravitationally with nearby stars. By comparing these results with standard models, the astronomers concluded that the most likely cause was the gravitational pull of a dense, massive object such as a black hole. They calculated the object's mass at 40,000 solar masses.[24]\n\nMore recent work has challenged conclusions that there is a black hole in the cluster's core, in particular disputing the proposed location of the cluster center.[26][27] Calculations using a revised location for the center found that the velocity of core stars does not vary with distance, as would be expected if an intermediate-mass black hole were present. The same studies also found that starlight does not increase toward the center but instead remains relatively constant. The authors noted that their results do not entirely rule out the black hole proposed by Noyola and colleagues, but they do not confirm it, and they limit its maximum mass to 12,000 solar masses.\n\nA study from July 10, 2024 has examined seven fast-moving stars from the center of Omega Centauri and found that their speeds were consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole of at least 8,200 solar masses.[28]\n\nIt has been speculated that Omega Centauri is the core of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the Milky Way.[29] Indeed, Kapteyn's Star, which is currently only 13 light-years away from Earth, is thought to originate from Omega Centauri.[30] Omega Centauri's chemistry and motion in the Milky Way are also consistent with this picture.[20] Like Mayall II, Omega Centauri has a range of metallicities and stellar ages that suggests that it did not all form at once (as globular clusters are thought to form) and may in fact be the remainder of the core of a smaller galaxy long since incorporated into the Milky Way.[31]\n\nThe novel Singularity (2012), by Ian Douglas, presents as fact that Omega Centauri and Kapteyn's Star originate from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, and this origin is central to the novel's plot. A number of scientific aspects of Omega Centauri are discussed as the story progresses, including the likely radiation environment inside the cluster and what the sky might look like from inside the cluster.[32]\n\nThe character Atlan has adventures in Omega Centauri in cycle 7 of the Atlan series, a spinoff of the German science fiction series Perry Rhodan.

A response team reviewed Terra’s status, and discussed potential impacts and options. Consequently, the team changed the battery charge rate and reduced spacecraft power demands by placing the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument into Safe Mode. As a result, ASTER data are not currently being collected. All other instruments continue uninterrupted. The engineering team will continue to closely monitor Terra’s power output and provide future updates on ASTER’s status.\n\nTerra explores the connections between Earth’s atmosphere, land, snow and ice, ocean, and energy balance to understand Earth’s climate and climate change and to map the impact of human activity and natural disasters on communities and ecosystems\n\nExamples of each instrument’s capabilities (clockwise): land composition (ASTER), reflected energy (CERES), aerosols (MISR), vegetation snow and ice (MODIS), carbon monoxide (MOPITT)\n\nDirect Broadcast Update (November 2024): \n\nTerra has not been transmitting Direct Broadcast since May 11, 2024, due to a solar array power generation issue limiting our ability to continue all science and provide Direct Broadcast continuously.

But, at the same time that our lives on Earth were being shaped by our access to technology, 705 kilometers above us, a satellite was changing how we understood our planet.\n\nFor 20 years, Terra, the flagship Earth observing satellite,\n\nhas chronicled changes on Earth. Designed and built in the 1980s and 90s, NASA and Lockheed Martin engineers set out to build a satellite that could take simultaneous measurements of Earth’s atmosphere, land, and water. Its mission – to understand how Earth is changing and to identify the consequences for life on Earth. Season after season, Terra data continues to help\n\nus understand how the evolving systems of our planet affect our lives – and how\n\nwe can use that data to benefit society.

C.) fue una matemática y filósofa griega,[1]​ miembro de la escuela pitagórica.\n\nFue hija del atleta Milón de Crotona, mecenas del filósofo y matemático Pitágoras,[2]​ con quien luego se casó.[3]​[4]​[5]​[1]​ Se le atribuye haber escrito tratados de matemáticas, física y medicina, y también sobre la proporción áurea. Se conservan fragmentos de sus cartas. La mayor parte de los textos que nos han llegado de mujeres de esta época, quizá por ser los que resultaban más interesantes a los religiosos que los han conservado, hablan de problemas morales o prácticos. A Téano se le atribuye un tratado Sobre la piedad del que se conserva un fragmento con una disquisición sobre el número. Además se le atribuyen los tratados sobre los poliedros rectangulares y sobre la teoría de la proporción, en particular sobre la proporción áurea.[6]​\n\nLa escuela pitagórica estaba formada por los seguidores de Pitágoras (572-497 a. C.). En la influyente escuela pitagórica, las Matemáticas se estudiaban con pasión. Se afirmaba \"todo es número\", ya que se creía que en la naturaleza todo podía explicarse mediante los números. Daban mucha importancia a la educación tanto de hombres como de mujeres, que no se limitaban a las artes útiles, sino que también se ocupaban del lenguaje y del rigor del razonamiento. Consideraban importante que una mujer fuera inteligente y culta.\n\nLa figura de Téano ha atraído la atención de los estudiosos, sobre todo de los trabajos feministas modernos, ya desde Gilles Ménage y su Historia Mulierum philosopharum, que compone precisamente con la intención de manifestar que también hubo mujeres filósofas en la antigüedad griega. Sea como sea, lo cierto es que la figura de Téano está construida, como tantas otras, con las técnicas habituales de los biógrafos antiguos, más atentos a la narración anecdótica y significativa que a la investigación rigurosa.[7]​\n\nTéano fue una matemática que consideraba que todo lo material era medible con los números naturales, por lo tanto todo se podía expresar con una medida exacta.[8]​\n\nLa tradición antigua nos da noticias de la existencia de Téano, considerada como la primera mujer filósofa, si bien su celebridad se atribuye a su vínculo matrimonial con Pitágoras.[9]​ Pero buena parte de su trabajo no era en realidad suyo: se firmaba a su nombre lo que publicaban los miembros de su escuela (algo muy habitual en el mundo antiguo), entre los que estaba Téano. Cuando Pitágoras murió, en una revuelta de los ciudadanos de Crotona contra su grupo, que se hizo con el control de la ciudad, Téano y varias hijas suyas se llevaron consigo los papeles del matemático, ampliando su trabajo. Viajaron por Grecia y Egipto, investigando no sólo en matemáticas, sino en medicina y otras ciencias. Sin sus aportaciones y las de sus hijas, es probable que Pitágoras hubiese quedado en el olvido.[10]​\n\nComo las demás pitagóricas, Téano pensaba que el Universo estaba regido por el número: la búsqueda de la perfección y la armonía en formas y proporciones le llevó a trabajar en el número áureo, el cual aparece frecuentemente en la naturaleza y fue el primer número irracional que conocieron los griegos. Este número lo conoció Téano por ser el resultado de dividir la longitud de la diagonal entre la longitud del lado del pentágono que aparece en el signo de la escuela pitagórica, el pentagrama.[11]​\n• Valdés, J. N., Nadal, A. O., Lorenzo, E. R., & Casanova, M. S. Barcelona, 2016. Muchos siglos antes de Hipatia ya hubo mujeres matemáticas. Sociedad Española de Estudios Clásicos.\n• Grau Guijarro, Sergi. Téano de Crotona i Pitàgoras de Samos: matrimoni pitagòric o invenció biogràfica? 2016\n• Sobre Téano y fragmentos de sus textos en el sitio de la Bibliotheca Augustana (Augsburgo); en griego.Teano de Crotona, filósofa: Las filósofas más antiguas que conocemos provienen del entorno de Pitágoras de Samos. Teano de Crotona es la pitagórica más famosa (a partir del 550 a. C). Nació en Crotona en el sur de Italia, donde Pitágoras había creado una escuela filosófica.\n\nDe esta filósofa sólo se conserva un fragmento del tratado Sobre la piedad. Pero parece que escribió diversos tratados de filosofía, matemáticas y medicina. Se le atribuye, entre otras cosas, el teorema matemático de la “proporción áurea”. Se conoce así la división de un segmento a través de un punto, de manera que la parte mayor es al todo como la parte menor a la mayor.\n\nIgual que Pitágoras, Teano era partidaria de una forma de vida que tiene como lema la medida y la prudencia. La finalidad de su filosofía es entender mejor el alma, que es inmortal y se reencarna después de la muerte. El cuerpo es una prisión del alma. El ser humano forma parte del mundo, que también tiene alma y origen divino. Jamás encontraremos la materia separada. Todo está relacionado con todo; no hay nada aislado. El mundo y el ser humano viven por naturaleza en armonía y deberíamos tener cuidado de no perturbar esta armonía. Se requiere ascesis y trabajo espiritual. Se atribuye un efecto positivo sobre todo a las matemáticas y a la música, ya que el número cuenta con un papel importante en estas dos disciplinas.\n\nPara Teano, la filosofía estaba muy ligada a la práctica; evoluciona sin alejarse mucho de la normalidad de la vida diaria. Reflexionar sobre el sentido de la vida implica también preguntarse cómo dar sentido a la vida de cada día. No hay una separación entre teoría y práctica.\n\nVeamos unas palabras de Teano de Crotona, de su obra Sobre la piedad:\n\n“Según he oído decir, muchos griegos piensan que Pitágoras afirma que todo ha sido engendrado por el número. Pero esta afirmación contiene una dificultad: ¿cómo podemos imaginar cosas que no son existentes y que pueden engendrar? Y es que Pitágoras no dijo que todas las cosas nacían del número, ya que en el número reside el orden esencial, y si dividimos el orden en primero, segundo y así sucesivamente, las cosas, que son contables, participan de este orden.”\n\nEn este texto tan breve ya puede apreciarse la complejidad del pensamiento de Teano. Igual que para Pitágoras, las matemáticas tienen para ella un papel importante.Teano (filosofa) - Wikipedia: Teano (in greco antico: Θεανώ?, Theanṓ; Crotone, VI secolo a.C.[1] – ...) è stata una filosofa greca antica che sarebbe stata, secondo alcune fonti, figlia o moglie di Pitagora, discepola della sua scuola[2] dove apprendevano la dottrina del maestro altre 28 allieve[3]. Secondo altre fonti[4] ella sarebbe stata invece la figlia di Brontino, successore di Pitagora. Dal matrimonio con il maestro sarebbero nati tre figli: due maschi, Telauge e Arimnesto, e una femmina, Damo. Dopo la morte del marito sposò Aristeo.\n\nSecondo la Suda, Didimo e Clemente Alessandrino, Teano nacque a Crotone[5].\n\nCi sono pervenute sette sue lettere, tre delle quali considerate autentiche.

Entre los tipos principales de fútbol se incluyen el fútbol de asociación, el fútbol americano, el fútbol canadiense, el fútbol australiano, el fútbol gaélico y también, en algunos contextos, el rugby league y el rugby union.\n\nSe estima que hay 250 millones de futbolistas en el mundo,[1]​ y muchos de ellos practican otras variantes del fútbol.\n\nJean-Pierre Papin describió el fútbol como un \"lenguaje universal\". [2]​ Los futbolistas de todo el mundo y de casi cualquier nivel pueden atraer regularmente a grandes multitudes de espectadores, y los jugadores son los puntos focales de fenómenos sociales generalizados como la cultura del fútbol asociativo .\n\nLos futbolistas generalmente comienzan como aficionados, y los mejores jugadores progresan hasta convertirse en jugadores profesionales. Normalmente inician en un equipo juvenil, que puede ser cualquier equipo local, y a partir de ahí, según sus habilidades y talento, los ojeadores les ofrecen contratos. Una vez fichados, algunos mejoran sus habilidades en el juego, y unos pocos avanzan a los equipos senior o profesionales.\n\nLos salarios en algunas ligas importantes son significativamente más altos que en otros trabajos. Los jugadores de la Premier League ganan un promedio de alrededor de 1 millón de dólares al año.[3]​ En los clubes más ricos de las ligas de fútbol europeas, algunos jugadores tienen un salario promedio que oscila entre 6 y 8 millones de dólares al año.[4]​ Los mejores jugadores de esos clubes pueden llegar a ganar hasta 220 millones de dólares al año.[5]​[6]​\n\nSin embargo, solo una fracción de los futbolistas profesionales masculinos recibe un salario de este nivel. Los salarios pueden ser mucho más moderados en otras divisiones y ligas, y un número significativo de los jugadores son semiprofesionales. Por ejemplo, el salario medio anual de los futbolistas de la Major League Soccer para la temporada 2013 fue de 148.693 dólares, con variaciones significativas según la posición del jugador (los porteros, por ejemplo, ganaron 85.296 dólares, mientras que los delanteros ganaron 251.805 dólares).[6]​[7]​\n\nLa popularidad y los salarios medios en las ligas femeninas son mucho más bajos. Por ejemplo, las jugadoras de la Liga Nacional de Fútbol Femenino (NWSL) (que comenzó en 2012) ganan entre 15.000 y 40.000 dólares al año en enero de 2017. [8]​\n\nUna minoría de futbolistas retirados continúa trabajando a tiempo completo en el fútbol, por ejemplo, como entrenadores. Un estudio de 1979 informó que los exjugadores del primer equipo estaban sobrerrepresentados como ejecutivos de alto rango en sus empresas y tenían mayor movilidad de ingresos que los jugadores del segundo equipo y los reservas.[9]​ Sin embargo, algunos experimentan problemas de salud crónicos.\n\nEn el fútbol asociativo, existen cuatro tipos tradicionales de posiciones: guardametas, defensores (laterales), mediocampistas (medios) y delanteros (atacantes). Las posiciones de propósito especial son líberos, pivotes defensivos, mediapuntas, extremos, interiores, etc.\n• Guardametas: gran altura, buenos reflejos, comunicación con la defensa, habilidad en el uno contra uno, dominio del área e inteligencia aérea. 10 ​\n• Defensas centrales: buena capacidad de cabeceo y entrada, altura, valentía en el intento y concentración. 11 ​\n• Laterales: ritmo, resistencia, anticipación, capacidad de entrada y marcación, ritmo de trabajo y responsabilidad del equipo. 12 ​\n• Mediocampistas: resistencia, capacidad de pase, responsabilidad del equipo, posicionamiento, capacidad de marcar. 13 ​\n• Extremos: ritmo, habilidad técnica como regate y control cercano, inteligencia sin balón, creatividad. 14 ​\n• Delanteros: habilidad para rematar, compostura, habilidad técnica, habilidad para cabecear, ritmo, inteligencia sin balón, rapidez. 15 ​\n\nLas posiciones en los equipos de fútbol americano están categorizadas por una forma de juego en la que cada una tiene su espectro de posiciones. Se dividen en equipos ofensivos, defensivos y especiales.\n\nLas investigaciones indican que los jugadores de fútbol americano que ejecutan un tiro penal en menos de 200 milisegundos después de que el árbitro hace sonar el silbato tienen significativamente menos probabilidades de anotar en comparación con aquellos que esperan más de un segundo.[16]​ [17]​\n\nUn estudio irlandés de 2002 sobre jugadores de fútbol gaélicos y de asociaciones caracterizó a los jugadores como \"delgados y musculosos con un nivel razonablemente alto de capacidad en todas las áreas del rendimiento físico\".[18]​ En contraste, en el fútbol americano, la obesidad puede ser causa de graves problemas de salud.[19]​\n\nUn estudio del año 2000 documentó las lesiones sufridas por futbolistas checos en todos los niveles:[20]​\n\n[21]​ La tendinitis rotuliana (dolor de rodilla) se considera una lesión que proviene de un sobreesfuerzo, y afecta a otros deportistas de prácticamente todos los deportes. Es un problema común entre los jugadores de fútbol y generalmente puede tratarse mediante un programa de fortalecimiento del cuádriceps. Las actividades de salto ejercen una tensión especialmente intensa sobre el tendón, y con saltos repetitivos, pueden producirse desgarros y lesiones en el tendón. La lesión crónica y la respuesta de curación resultan en inflamación y dolor localizado.[22]​\n\nAunque los niveles de depresión y dolor en los jugadores de fútbol retirados están a la par con el promedio social, [23]​ algunos jugadores sufren lesiones crónicas posteriores a la jubilación. Las lesiones en la cabeza son una preocupación particular.\n\nLos estudios han demostrado durante mucho tiempo que los exjugadores de fútbol americano de la NFL tienen una esperanza de vida más larga que el público en general o los hombres con una distribución racial y de edad similar, pero una tasa más alta de problemas cardiovasculares. [24]​ Un estudio que comparó las muertes de exjugadores de las Grandes Ligas de Béisbol encontró que los jugadores de béisbol vivían aún más, lo que quizás sugiere un sesgo de \"trabajador sano\" donde los atletas de la NFL vivieron menos tiempo de lo que habrían vivido de otra manera, a pesar de su esperanza de vida más larga que el promedio. [25]​ Una revisión de la evidencia realizada en 2009 en el American Journal of Medicine concluyó que la evidencia existente \"no sugiere un aumento de la mortalidad\", pero sí \"sugiere un mayor riesgo cardiovascular, particularmente en los linieros más pesados\". [26]​\n\nEn el fútbol asociativo, un estudio alemán de 2011 encontró que los jugadores de la selección alemana vivían 1,9 años menos que la población masculina general. [27]​\n\nUn estudio de 1983 sobre jugadores de rugby encontró que la esperanza de vida de los All Blacks era la misma que la de la población general. [28]​\n\nLos futbolistas australianos tienen tasas de mortalidad más bajas que la población general. [29]​\n\nLos jugadores de fútbol americano son propensos a sufrir lesiones en la cabeza, como conmociones cerebrales . En la vejez, esto aumenta el riesgo de demencia [30]​ y Alzheimer . [31]​ Los jugadores profesionales de fútbol americano que reportan conmociones cerebrales tienen un mayor riesgo de tener episodios depresivos más adelante en la vida en comparación con los jugadores retirados que reportan no tener conmociones cerebrales. [32]​ [33]​\n\nProbablemente debido al trauma repetido asociado con los cabeceos, se ha sugerido que el fútbol de asociación profesional aumenta la incidencia de esclerosis lateral amiotrófica . [34]​ En un estudio de 1987 sobre exjugadores de la selección nacional de fútbol de la asociación noruega, se encontró que un tercio de los jugadores padecía atrofia cerebral central, es decir, daño cerebral. Un estudio de 1999 relacionó el fútbol con una lesión traumática en la cabeza crónica (CTHI): [35]​\n\nLos ligamentos cruzados anteriores son particularmente vulnerables en la mayoría de los tipos de fútbol debido a las lesiones que pueden sufrir durante las entradas .\n\nSe ha encontrado una mayor incidencia de osteoartritis en la articulación de la cadera en jugadores de fútbol retirados. [36]​\n\nUn estudio de 2012 sobre lesiones en asociaciones de fútbol encontró que el 19% de todas las lesiones eran lesiones musculares, de las cuales el 54% afectaba a los músculos del muslo. [37]​\n\nEn un estudio de 2009, se descubrió que el fútbol asociado se asocia con patrones de sueño y funcionamiento psicológico favorables en jugadores de fútbol adolescentes. [38]​\n\nSe ha descubierto que la tasa de suicidio entre los veteranos de la NFL es un 59% menor que en la población general.\n\nEn 2012, la FIFA publicó un documento destinado a identificar factores de riesgo clave para los jugadores de fútbol. [39]​\n\nEn 2015, una revisión sistemática de una muestra de cincuenta y cuatro publicaciones revisadas por pares y tres artículos sobre la mortalidad y la longevidad de los atletas de élite dio como resultado importantes resultados de longevidad para los atletas de élite (béisbol, fútbol americano, fútbol, baloncesto y ciclismo). en comparación con controles de la población general y otros atletas de la misma edad y sexo\". La longevidad estuvo influenciada por factores como el tipo de deporte, la posición de juego, la carrera y el sistema energético. [40]​\n\nUn estudio observacional realizado con futbolistas profesionales -en activo (durante su carrera) y recientemente retirados (después de su carrera, con más de 45 años)- en 70 países entre 2007 y 2013, elaborado a partir de datos de la Unión Mundial de Futbolistas (FIFPro), registró 214 muertes de las cuales el 25% fue causada por accidentes, el 11% por suicidios y el 33% por sospecha de patología cardíaca (sobre un total del 55% de las muertes causadas por algún tipo de enfermedad). [41]​\n\nSe requieren evaluaciones clínicas, ECG y ecocardiografías de los atletas como herramientas previas a la participación para prevenir muertes cardíacas súbitas en personas menores de 35 años. Para evaluar el riesgo de fibrosis miocárdica, se puede utilizar y recomendar el uso adicional de realce tardío con gadolinio (LGE) con imágenes pre y poscontraste y de fracción de volumen extracelular (ECV). [42]​ Incluso alentado, todavía no se hizo obligatorio.\n\nEn 2015 se analizaron 205 muertes entre deportistas profesionales norteamericanos que estaban registrados como activos en el momento de su fallecimiento. Se recopilaron datos para los cuatro deportes principales: Asociación Nacional de Baloncesto (NBA), Liga Nacional de Fútbol Americano (NFL), Liga Nacional de Hockey (NHL) y Liga Mayor de Béisbol (MLB). Los jugadores activos de la NFL y la NBA tenían \"una mayor probabilidad de morir en un accidente automovilístico \" y una probabilidad significativamente mayor de morir de una enfermedad relacionada con el corazón en comparación con las poblaciones activas de la NHL y la MLB. [43]​\n\nEn 2013, un estudio sobre 3.439 atletas retirados de las Ligas Nacionales de Fútbol con al menos cinco temporadas acreditadas entre 1959 y 1988 no mostró una correlación estadística entre la mortalidad por suicidio y la actividad profesional, particularmente relacionada con el fútbol, en comparación con la muestra de control general. No se informó estratificación entre jugadores de posición veloces y no veloces. [44]​\n\nHasta la década de 2000 se ha publicado un número muy limitado de estudios formales sobre la mortalidad por todas las causas en jugadores de fútbol, a pesar del gran interés del público por el asunto. Un estudio ampliado realizado en Italia entre 1975 y 2003 sobre un total de 5.389 jugadores, de entre 14 y 35 años, destacó que, si bien la mortalidad por cáncer y enfermedades cardiovasculares entre la cohorte de jugadores de fútbol era significativamente menor que la de la población italiana en general, \" Las tasas de mortalidad por esclerosis lateral amiotrófica y accidentes automovilísticos fueron significativamente más altas de lo esperado, y para la ELA el riesgo es 18 veces mayor de lo esperado\".

In the Iberian Peninsula humanists often wrote in Spanish and Portuguese, adapting the literary style of Petrarch, Boccaccio, and other Italian humanists to their own local languages. Northern European humanists continued to rely on Latin, although there were notable exceptions of humanists who dedicated themselves to using and expanding their local languages. Outside Italy, humanists promoted notions about their movement similar to those already expressed in Florence and other Italian cities. They celebrated their movement as the birth of a new \"Golden Age\" in which religion and learning would be invigorated by the examples of Antiquity and a renewal in moral philosophy. In Northern Europe and Spain, humanism became associated with plans for Christian reform and placed less emphasis on the rhetoric of Cicero and other ancient writers. For this reason humanism outside Italy has sometimes been called \"Christian humanism.\" The philosophers and writers of this movement advocated a renewal of Christianity that would be illuminated by the new knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew and envisioned a reform of the church that would rely on the knowledge of Antiquity and the study of the scriptures in their original languages. They emphasized the importance of moral philosophy rather than scholastic logic, and were often just as critical of the scholastics as their Italian predecessors had been. But as in Italy, the gulf that separated humanism from scholasticism was not so deep as many humanists claimed. Some humanists, for instance, studied both scholasticism and the newer forms of learning, but their anti-scholastic rhetoric made many universities initially resistant to the humanists. By 1500, though, humanists had gained a foothold in many institutions of learning north of the Alps and in Spain and Portugal.\n\nIn both Germany and the Netherlands, the humanist movement exhibited signs that were similar to the Renaissance elsewhere in Northern Europe. Like its Italian version, humanism here owed a great debt to the classics of Greek and Roman Antiquity. Rediscovering and studying classical texts became a burning desire of humanists in Germany and the Netherlands; these scholars argued that literary study was more conducive to human virtue than the arid logical considerations of scholasticism. For these reasons, the humanists initially encountered opposition as they tried to assume positions in Dutch and German schools and universities. Eventually, these barriers were overcome, and by 1500, the humanists had gained a foothold. In the educational institutions in which they taught, the humanists argued for a reformed curriculum based upon the study of the classical languages. But as the movement developed in Germany and the Netherlands, they also advocated religious reform and an ideal of learned Christian piety. In Germany, the first great scholar of humanism was Rudolph Agricola (1444–1485). Like many later German and Dutch humanists, Agricola had been schooled by the Brethren of the Common Life, the lay monastic movement that had developed in the Netherlands and Germany from the Modern Devotion movement. When he was 25, Agricola traveled to Italy, studying the Classics at Ferrara and Pavia. After ten years he returned to Germany, where he spent the remainder of his life encouraging the development of humanistic studies from his post at the University of Heidelberg. Agricola's religious ideas were conservative and traditional, but he laid great emphasis on the study of the scriptures, something that later Dutch and German humanists embraced enthusiastically. Although he died relatively young, he had by the time of his death developed a group of disciples that included Conrad Celtis and Jakob Wimpheling, two scholars who expanded the cause of humanism in Germany. Their efforts saw humanism embraced in the imperial court, as the emperor Maximilian I appointed a number of classical scholars to serve as secretaries, historians, and astrologers in his government. One of the greatest of these was Johannes Reuchlin, who accepted several imperial appointments during the 1490s and 1500s. Reuchlin was one of the most widely traveled scholars of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. He studied at the universities of Orlèans, Basel, Paris, Tübingen, and in Rome and Florence, before devoting himself to the study of the Hebrew language and Jewish literature. He authored the first grammar of Hebrew intended for Christian students of the language, and he published several monumental studies of the Jewish Cabala. Because of these involvements, Reuchlin was eventually drawn into a controversy over the study of Jewish books (see Religion: Reuchlin Affair). Many of the imperial humanists that Germany produced in these years were advocates of German nationalism. In their historical works these court humanists tried to address a sense of cultural inferiority. They attempted to show in their works that Germans had not been barbarians (an interpretation of German history that Italian humanists had kept alive through their knowledge of Tacitus and other ancient Latin writers). The Dutch humanists did not share this focus on national identity. But like their German counterparts, they took an interest in the study of traditional mystical texts and in the newer metaphysical ideas of Renaissance Platonism.\n\n[This text has been suppressed due to author restrictions]\n\nThe Dutch-born Desiderius Erasmus (c. 1466–1536) was the commanding figure produced by the Renaissance in Northern Europe. Erasmus was a religious thinker of profound depth, a writer of some of the sixteenth century's most brilliant and cultivated prose, and a philosopher of some sophistication. Like Agricola and other German and Dutch humanists, he had been trained in youth in the traditions of the Brethren of the Common Life, and the concept of the imitation of Christ advocated by the Modern Devotion had shaped his early life. To these early interests, Erasmus added training in the methods of both humanism and scholasticism. Erasmus's writings fall into three categories. First, he produced works of critical scholarship, editing important classical works and translations, including his definitive translation of the New Testament. Second, Erasmus published a number of comic and satirical works, including his famous Colloquies. He wrote the Colloquies as a series of conversational dialogues, and teachers used them to train young men in the knowledge of Latin. The works mocked the foibles and superstitions of people, most especially of monks and scholars. Finally, a third category of Erasmus's works aimed for a re-establishment of early Christian teachings in Europe. In this last kind of work, Erasmus frequently outlined his \"Philosophy of Christ,\" a set of teachings he believed were revealed in the gospels, particularly in the Sermon on the Mount. Among the several works that Erasmus wrote in this vein, his Handbook of the Militant Christian (1503) was the most influential in attracting disciples to his ideas and plans for Christian reform. The work argued that the kernel of all Christ's teachings consisted in love, charity, and respect exercised toward one's neighbors. \"Wish for good, pray for good, act for good to all men\" is how he summarized this great rule in the Handbook. Erasmus's beautiful literary style and his engaging summation of the core of Christian teachings attracted numerous admirers throughout Europe in the sixteenth century. To many educated humanists, his works presented a middle path between the extremes of traditional Catholicism and the newer and more radical forms of Protestantism. Vestiges of his reform ideas survived in the works of many humanists, many of whom served in Christian reform efforts throughout Europe. His ideas, for instance, were particularly important in shaping the course of the Reformation's teachings in England, and had admirers at the same time in the Catholic reformers in Spain and Italy. As the sixteenth century progressed, though, and religious positions hardened on both sides of the Protestant and Catholic divides in Europe, Erasmus attracted increasing criticism from many quarters. Catholic traditionalists identified in Erasmus's emphasis on the spiritual nature of Christianity a set of teachings that was subversive to the sacraments and religious discipline. By the end of the century, a number of his works had been placed upon the Index of Prohibited Books, a list of books which Catholics were forbidden to read. For committed Protestants, too, Erasmus's denial of the concept of justification by faith and his loyalty to Rome helped limit his appeal.\n\nRenaissance humanism attracted significant support from English intellectuals at the end of the fifteenth century, despite the conservative character of intellectual life in the country at the time. Many aspects of English learning remained tied to medieval scholasticism, and chivalric ideals still dominated English elite society in the late fifteenth century. Still, during the 1460s and 1470s a group of English scholars traveled to Italy to study with humanists and several were students of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino. These included Thomas Linacre, William Sellyng, and William Grocyn. This last figure was particularly important in building a circle of humanist scholars in England. Grocyn served as court physician and a royal tutor during the time of Henry VII and Henry VIII. While he did not write a great deal, like Rudolph Agricola in Germany, he helped to popularize humanistic studies among England's intellectual elite. The first undeniably accomplished English humanist, though, was John Colet (1466–1519), who was a member of the clergy and dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. Colet had spent four years in Italy during his youth, much of it in close affiliation with Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. When he returned to England, he helped to spread knowledge of Ficino and Renaissance Platonism. Like Erasmus and other Northern Renaissance humanists, he was critical of the corruption of the church and the popular superstitions of the people, and his sermons argued for a reform of ecclesiastical abuses. His great achievement, though, lay in fostering the study of the humanities in England through his foundation of St. Paul's School in London. This cathedral school opened the way for the training of members of the English elite in the classics and it exerted a significant influence on English intellectual life during the following centuries.\n\nSir Thomas More (1478–1535), an admirer of John Colet, exemplifies a different path taken by some English humanists. He was a layman and a lawyer who occupied the highest political positions in the court ofHenry VIII. More received his Bachelor of Arts at Oxford before studying law at the Inns of Court in London. By 1510, he had become an official in the City of London and he soon rose to serve in Henry VIII's diplomatic service. It was while on a diplomatic mission to Flanders that More wrote part of his famous Utopia, a work that has since his time been the model for many imaginary visions of a perfect society. The Utopia, one of the best examples of sixteenth-century literature, also reflects More's personal philosophy (see Literature: Utopia). He was skeptical of humankind's ability to achieve virtue, and the society he imagined in his work was tightly ordered and highly disciplined so that its people could avoid their natural inclinations toward wrong-doing. More was well read, and an excellent stylist in Latin prose; he was also well connected among humanists in England and in Europe. Among his correspondents, he maintained a close friendship with Erasmus throughout his life, and Erasmus dedicated his Praise of Folly to him. Religiously, though, More was more conservative than the Dutch humanist. He engaged in prayer vigils and practiced ascetic disciplines like the wearing of a hair shirt. While he enthusiastically supported charities, he was also an unswerving opponent of heresy. As a royal official, he supported the persecution of heretics, including those who were drawn to the new Protestant ideas that began to circulate in England in the 1520s. The same sword of royal authority that More wielded to eradicate Protestants in England would eventually be turned against him. Because of his loyalty to the Roman Church, he refused to recognize Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and he was condemned and beheaded in 1535.\n\nIn France, humanism developed within the same time frame as it did in Germany, the Netherlands, and England. While the country's intellectual centers, particularly the University of Paris, were resistant to the new studies, humanists had established themselves at Lyon and Paris by the late fifteenth century. Both towns were important printing centers, and they played a key role in spreading the new humanistic knowledge throughout Europe. Robert Gaguin (1433–1501) was the first in a distinguished lineage of French humanists. In his works he tried to harmonize classical philosophy with Christian teaching, a goal that would be pursued by a number of French Renaissance thinkers. Gaguin's influence upon his students at Paris helped to permanently establish the humanities within the university. His influence, though, was soon to be eclipsed by Giullaume Budé (1467–1540) and Jacques Lefèvre D'Etaples (1450–1536), the two most accomplished scholars of the French Renaissance. By training, Budé was a lawyer, and found no university appointment until he established his own college late in life. He was a particularly astute philologist, who translated the Greek works of Plutarch and wrote treatises in Greek even in his youth. Of the many honors that Budé received during his lifetime, one was to prove particularly important for posterity: his appointment as the head of the king's library enabled him to purchase a number of important Greek manuscripts. Jacques Lefèvre D'Etaples, by contrast, took a different turn in his scholarship. Inspired by the example of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Lefèvre became convinced of the unity of philosophical truth. As a result he ranged broadly in his studies, dedicating himself to the works of Italian Renaissance Platonists, the medieval scholastics and mystics, the Jewish cabalistic writers, and hermeticism. As he matured, though, he concentrated his efforts on biblical scholarship, and in his studies of the New Testament he developed ideas that were similar to many German Protestants. Lefèvre remained a devout Catholic, but as a consequence, his scriptural studies shaped the ideas of some of France's early Protestant reformers.\n\nHumanist influences can be seen in both Spain and Portugal from the early fifteenth century as the works of Petrarch and Boccacio became popular in the peninsula. In both countries, as elsewhere in Europe, the demand for properly trained secretaries and diplomats helped to fuel the popularity of humanism. The presence of an increasing number of skilled Latinists within the region in the fifteenth century encouraged the study of classical texts, as well as the importation of works by the Italian humanists and their translation into Spanish and Portuguese. During the reign of the married monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, humanist study within the two kingdoms of Castile and Aragon expanded. The project for a new polyglot Bible at Alcala, which became known as the Complutensian Polyglot, brought many humanists to Spain in the early sixteenth century. But it was not until the reign of the Spanish emperor Charles V (r. 1516–1556) that a true Renaissance in Spanish learning occurred. During the early part of Charles' reign Spain's humanists revered the works of Erasmus, including the Handbook of the Militant Christian, which for a time became the country's most widely read devotional book. Its influence persisted even after its placement on the Index in 1559. In Charles' Spain, a number of distinguished humanists were actively engaged in the king's service. These included Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Juan de Valdés, and Antonio de Guevara. The greatest of Spain's humanists, Juan Luis Vives, was also from a family of recent converts to Christianity. Known as conversos, these former Jews or descendants of Jews were particularly receptive to the ideas of Erasmian humanism. Vives studied in Spain until his teenage years, when he moved to the University of Paris. When still young, he distinguished himself through the publication of his The Fable of Man, a work tinged with Renaissance Platonism. As a result of his literary successes, Vives became a professor of literature at the University of Louvain, and eventually served as the royal tutor in the court of Henry VIII. When he failed to endorse Henry's divorce of Catherine of Aragon, he was forced to emigrate, and he settled in Bruges in Flanders where he spent the remainder of his life. Vives' death came before a great change in attitude toward humanism began to sweep across his native Spain. At home, fears of Protestantism gave rise after mid-century to attempts to suppress the Erasmian humanism that had circulated in Spain relatively freely during the first half of the century. Humanists came to be suspected of heresy, and followers of Erasmus, together with Spanish mystics (known as the Alumbrados) became victims of persecution. In Portugal, the rise of counter-reforming sentiments similarly discouraged a nascent humanist culture.\n\nC. G.

Tucidide e Machiavelli (Somiglianze – Differenze). Di Apostolos Apostolou: Tucidide: C’era di nome una democrazia ma di fatto un governo del cittadino migliore..\n\n Machiavelli: Tutti gli stati, tutti i domini che hanno avuto e hanno imperio sopra gli uomini, sono stati e sono o repubbliche o principati.\n\nTucidide.\n\n Di solito il realismo politico si caratterizza per il principio di privilegiare l’interesse e la sicurezza nazionale rispetto ad ideologie e problematiche morali e sociali. Tucidide vede il realismo politico con un senso più ampio, cioè come realtà storica attraverso un approccio empirico. Ma anche come l’esperienza del contatto che include le esperienze di posizione, di equilibrio e di supporto.\n\nIl realismo politico secondo Tucidide è il comune (koinon B35). La democrazia è il regime esplicitamente fondato sull’opinione, sul confronto tra le opinioni, sulla formazione di un’opinione comune. La confutazione delle opinioni altrui è ben più che permessa e legittima, essa è addirittura l’ossigeno della vita pubblica (Peri homonoias H 93).\n\nLa vita è esperienza, cioè improvvisazione, utilizzazione delle occasioni, tentativi in tutte le direzioni. E il cittadino ha dignità solo quando può scegliere il suo modo d’essere. Perciò il termine polis indica l’ipotetico patto fondato sul reciproco interesse dei politai (cioè cittadini) della città. (Γ 82). Perché come dirà il poeta K. Kavafis: “…. Ti verrà dietro la città. Per le vie girerai: le stesse. E negli stessi quartieri invecchierai, ti farai bianco nelle stesse mura. Perenne approdo, questa città….”\n\nCon altre parole secondo Tucidide il rapporto tra polis e polites (cittadini) non è lo stesso con quello di civis-civitas. Perché nella democrazia ateniese, il potere è nelle mani del popolo: nei tribunali tutti i cittadini sono eguali, e nell’esercito (i cittadini sono anche oplite, cioè soldati) delle cariche la capacità e il merito hanno annullato ogni differenza tra ricchi e poveri. La philotimia (Tucidide III, 82,8) è la virtù dei cittadini. (Nietzsche nella philotimia di Tucidide cerca il concetto dell’uomo superiore.) Euripide ha disegnato nei suoi versi un ritratto lusinghiero della polis democratica, dove regnano libertà e uguaglianza, amicizia e unione.\n\nLibertà, amicizia, eguaglianza è la concordia. Questa ultima è l’unità del sentire e del pensare (homonoia) raggiunta dai cittadini nella determinazione dei fini comuni e delle scelte necessarie per conseguirli. Se non c’è frattura tra l’individuo e la comunità, tra la sua vita privata e quella pubblica, la connessione è una dialettica della pluralità del diverso su cui la dialettica non avrebbe più alcun potere (Tucidide H 97. Sygrasis – Mescolanza. O come dice Aristotele ex anomoion he polis, Politica 3,1277° 5-6, cioè, la città è ineguale).\n\nPoiché nella città secondo Tucidide esiste sempre l’antinomia, discorso doppio (Dissoi logoi, cioè discorsi doppi) e l’idea della mutua paura (antipalon deos) necessaria al mantenimento dell’equilibrio. Così la mutua paura (antipalon deos) diventa (isopalo sevas) bilanciato rispetto.\n\nNella guerra civile esiste la techne politiche, (Protagora 322 b-c) cioè la formazione del cittadino e dei dirigenti, il compito di un processo indicativo che riguarda almeno in teoria, tutti gli uomini. E con questa techne politiche, si può risalire ad una concezione del rapporto di individuo e comunità, di cittadino e stato.\n\nAnche questa è la concezione che Platone in un passo delle Leggi riproduce dicendo che un’educazione rettamente intesa è quella che sa far nascere negli animi fin degli anni dell’infanzia, il desiderio di diventare un perfetto cittadino, capace ad un tempo di obbedire e di comandare secondo giustizia.\n\nSocrate accetta il giudizio del tribunale formato dai propri concittadini. Possiamo vedere nel Critone il suo discorso, scambiato tanto spesso per un’arringa moralistica, e uno sviluppo magnifico della fondamentale idea greca della formazione dell’individuo attraverso la propria città. Simodide scriveva: polis andra didaskei, cioè la città educa l’uomo.\n\nQui posiamo vedere anche la differenza tra Tucidide e Machiavelli. Il realismo politico di Machiavelli è il successo. E il successo per un principe nuovo si misura dalla sua capacità di conservare lo stato.\n\nL’introduzione del criterio del successo come unico metro di giudizio politico permette al Machiavelli di distinguere anche all’interno della categoria del tiranno. Il tiranno Agatocle e il tiranno Liverotto da Fermo sono i modelli di realismo politico secondo Machiavelli. Agatocle, e Liverotto da Fermo avevano conquistato lo stato con delitti e efferati. (Principe, cap. XVIII).\n\nTucidide si differenzia anche dalla dottrina spinoziana dello Stato, esposta nel Trattato politico e nel Trattato teologico- politico. Però quello di Spinoza è un realismo politico condensato sul principio della tolleranza (che significa aggiustamenti e riforme senza rivolgimenti rivoluzionari) e sul dogma come diceva Caillois Roland che sostiene: “il sistema rimane l’uomo muore”.\n\nIl realismo politico di Tucidide non esprime una speranza, perché secondo Tucidide la speranza è una condizione umana molto complessa e articolata fatta di pieni e vuoti, di esplosioni e di ripiegamenti e non è mai un sentire identico (Tucidide E 84-116). Anche l’idea di “ necessità”, considera in maniera troppo compatta situazioni che, invece sono molto differenziate (A,22,1-2). Possiamo dunque dire che il realismo politico di Tucidide diventa una riforma della politica per mezzo della molteplicità delle esperienze vitali.\n\nAlla natura del governo, che è ravvisabile nell’uso platonico e tucididico, sembrano propri alcuni elementi. Innanzitutto quello della pluralità delle parti che costituiscono un insieme, sia questo l’anima, l’ambito della casa, o quello della polis. Innanzitutto quello della pluralità delle parti che costituiscono un insieme, sia questo l’anima, l’ambito della casa, o quello della polis.\n\nTucidide era sostenitore di Teramene. Tucidide Libro H). Teramene fu uno dei fautori del colpo di Stato oligarchico ateniese del 411 a.C., che portò al governo la Boulé dei Quattrocento. Successivamente si oppose a tale regime, sostituendolo con l’assemblea dei Cinquemila che, dopo aver eliminato i principali esponenti dei Quattrocento, nel 409 restaurò pienamente la democrazia. Tucidide scrive: ἐγίγνετό τε λόγῳ µὲν δηµοκρατία, ἔργῳ δὲ ὑπὸ τοῦ πρώτου ἀνδρὸς ἀρχή («C’era di nome una democrazia, ma di fatto un governo del cittadino migliore» II,65,9)\n\nMachiavelli.\n\n “Tutti gli stati, tutti i domini che hanno avuto e hanno imperio sopra li uomini, sono stati e sono o repubbliche o principati.” Con queste parole apre il Principe di Machiavelli (1469-1527). Ai principati nuovi, è dedicato la maggior parte del libro “Discorsi” di Machiavelli. Distingue quattro specie secondo il diverso modo con cui il potere viene conquistato: I) per virtù; II) per fortuna; III) per scelera , con la violenza; IV) col consenso dei cittadini. Queste quattro specie si dispongono in coppie antitetiche; virtù – fortuna, forza – consenso.\n\nMachiavelli è considerato il primo grande teorico della politica moderna e dello Stato uscito dal medioevo. La virtù politica comprende anche l’astuzia e l’uso della violenza, purché essa sia “ben usata” per costituire o difendere uno Stato ben ordinato. Il principe deve agire da “ volpe e leone”, cioè deve essere astuto e deciso, ingannatore e violento.\n\nMachiavelli sostiene che per salvare lo Stato il principe deve essere disposto anche a “operare contro la fede, la carità, l’umanità e la religione”, poiché se riuscirà, con tali mezzi, a conseguire quell’obiettivo, allora tutti lo loderanno e lo considereranno “virtuoso”.\n\nNel capitolo XV del Principe troviamo, la prospettiva machiavelliana: “Essendo l’intento mio scrivere cosa utile a chi la intende, mi è parso più conveniente andare drieto alla verità effettuale della cosa, che all’immaginazione di essa. E molti si sono immaginati repubbliche e principati che non si sono mai visti né conosciuti essere in vero; perché elli è tanto discosto da come si vive a come si doverrebbe vivere, che colui che lascia quello che si fa per quello che si doverrebbe fare, impara più tosto la ruina che la perservazione sua: perché uno uomo che voglia fare in tutte le parte professione di buono, conviene rovini infra tanti che non sono buoni. Onde è necessario a uno principe, volendosi mantenere, imparare a potere essere non buono, et usarlo e non usare secondo la necessità. Lasciando adunque indrieto le cose circa uno principe immaginate, e discorrendo quelle che sono vere, dico che tutti li uomini, quando se ne parla, e massime e principi, per essere posti più alti, sono notati di alcune di queste qualità che arrecano loro o biasimo o laude “.\n\n \n\n Cioè i concetti di virtù e di fortuna sono come è noto, centrali nella concezione machiavellica della storia.\n\nLa virtù secondo Machiavelli è la capacità personale di dominare gli eventi e di realizzare, anche ricorrendo a qualsiasi mezzo, il fine proposto; per fortuna, intende il corso degli eventi che non dipendono dalla volontà umana. Oggi cerchiamo il momento per esempio soggettivo, il momento oggettivo, o il momento storico. Secondo Machiavelli ciò che uno consegue non dipende né tutto dalla virtù, né tutto dalla fortuna, non tutto dal merito personale, non tutto dal favore delle circostanze, ma dall’una e dall’altra in parti uguali.\n\nScrive per esempio (cap.XXV) “ Nondimanco perché il nostro libero arbitrio non sia spento, iudico potere essere vero che la fortuna sia arbitra della metà delle azioni nostre, ma che atiam lei ne lasci governare l’ altra metà, o presso a noi.”\n\nCon Machiavelli l’Italia ha conosciuto il più grande teorico della politica e ha influenzato tutto il pensiero politico occidentale, e come leggiamo in Wikipedia . «Secondo Machiavelli la politica è il campo nel quale l’uomo può mostrare nel modo più evidente la propria capacità d’iniziativa, il proprio ardimento, la capacità di costruire il proprio destino secondo il classico modello del faber fortunae suae.Nel suo pensiero si risolve il conflitto fra regole morali e ragion di Stato che impone talvolta di sacrificare i propri princìpi in nome del superiore interesse di un popolo.»\n\nMolti hanno scritto che il Principe di Machiavelli era una specie di manuale delle nefandezze della tirannide celebre, mentre altri che la politica si presenta come puro calcolo di interessi, e la politica è un prodotto della immortalità, le passioni gli interessi sono il luogo, la sostanza della politica.

It is Real Madrid's reserve team. They play their home games at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium with a capacity of 6,000 seats.[2]\n\nReserve teams in Spain play in the same league system as their senior team rather than a separate league. Reserve teams, however, cannot play in the same division as their senior team. Therefore, Real Madrid Castilla are ineligible for promotion to the La Liga as long as Real Madrid plays there. Consequently, they must play at least one level below their main side and they are not eligible to play in the Copa del Rey. In addition, only under-23 players, or under-25 players with a professional contract, can switch between senior and reserve teams.\n\nIn 1948, Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, a local amateur team, then playing in the Tercera División, agreed to become a feeder club for Real Madrid. Originally formed in 1930, the team took its name from the national motto of Spain. Real gave AD Plus Ultra financial support and in return were given first refusal on the club's best players. By 1949, they made their debut in the Segunda División and in 1952, the club became the official Real reserve team. In 1959, they reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Generalísimo, losing 7–2 on aggregate to eventual runners-up Granada.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, future senior Real Madrid players and Spanish internationals such as José María Zárraga, Enrique Mateos, Ramón Marsal, Pedro Casado, Juan Manuel Villa, José María Vidal, Fernando Serena and Ramón Grosso all spent time at the club, and Juan Alonso finished off his career there. The singer Julio Iglesias played as a goalkeeper for the club in the early 1960s until injury ended his football career.[3] Miguel Muñoz began his coaching career at the club. In 1972, Plus Ultra folded because of the demise of the insurance company of the same name, and their position in the Tercera División was taken by Castilla Club de Fútbol, the new reserve team for Real Madrid, on 21 July.\n\nAs Castilla CF, the team enjoyed something of a golden age. During this era, with a team that included Agustín, Ricardo Gallego and Francisco Pineda, Castilla reached the final of the 1979–80 Copa del Rey. During their cup run, they beat four Primera División teams, including Hércules, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Sporting de Gijón.[4] The latter two eventually finished second and third in the Primera División. In the final, they played Real Madrid but lost 6–1. Because Real also won the Primera División, however, Castilla qualified for the 1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup. Despite beating West Ham United 3–1 in the opening game at the Santiago Bernabéu, they lost the return 5–1 after extra time and went out in the first round.[4] Castilla reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on three further occasions, in 1984, 1986, and 1988.\n\nIn 1984, with Amancio Amaro as coach, Castilla won the Segunda División. Amaro's tenure as coach saw the rise of the famous La Quinta del Buitre – Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel, and Miguel Pardeza. Castilla were ineligible for promotion, however, because Real Madrid were already in the Primera División. In the 1987–88 season, they finished third in the Segunda División, but were once again ineligible for promotion.\n\nIn 1991, the Royal Spanish Football Federation banned the use of separate names for reserve teams and Castilla CF became known as Real Madrid Deportiva and then Real Madrid B. In the early 1990s, two former Castilla players, Vicente del Bosque and Rafael Benítez, began their coaching careers with the team. In 1997, the team was relegated to the Segunda División B, but despite this, they continued to produce internationally acclaimed players. These have included Raúl, Guti and Iker Casillas, who all became established members of the senior Real Madrid team.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, coach Juan Ramón López Caro guided the team back to the Segunda División and the team subsequently revived the El Castilla name and became known as Real Madrid Castilla. In 2006, the new stadium of the club's training facilities Ciudad Real Madrid was named the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium and Francisco Moreno Cariñena became the first independent chairman in 16 years. In this year, the team also has continued to produce quality players such as Roberto Soldado and Álvaro Arbeloa.\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, the team was relegated to the Segunda División B under the management of ex-Real Madrid legend Míchel after occupying 19th place in the league in a disappointing season. Míchel received a lot of criticism and accepted all the blame for the team's bad performances, especially for those who had a wonderful season in the 2005–06 season, such as Rubén de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi García. The reserves produced other quality players, including Juan Mata and Álvaro Negredo.\n\nReal Madrid Castilla was promoted back to the Segunda División at the end of the 2011–12 season after beating Cádiz in the play-offs with an aggregate of score 8–1 and this year the club produced one quality player, Dani Carvajal who was sold to Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 before he returned to Real Madrid in 2013 to play in the first team.\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, three quality players Nacho, Álvaro Morata and Jesé were promoted to the first team, and then Castilla was relegated in the last matchday after being defeated by Real Murcia in the last match of the season.\n\nSince 2014 when they played in the third division, Castilla continued to produce other quality players, including Lucas Vázquez, Fernando Pacheco, Borja Mayoral, Marcos Llorente, Sergio Reguilón, Óscar Rodríguez, Achraf Hakimi and Fran García.\n\nAfter the resumption of competitions in the 2020–21 season, the team finished runner-up in their group and qualified to play in the promotion system to the new categories of Spanish football after a restructuring of the same by the RFEF for the 2021–22 season.[5] In the promotion playoffs, the team finished third, which secured their place in the Primera Federación. They also had the chance to move up to the Segunda División, but they were eliminated in the semifinals by Ibiza.[6] The team was thus one of those that premiered the new Primera Federación, being placed in Group II. In 2022–23 season, Castilla placed in Group I and finished in third place, they have chance promotion to Segunda División, but they were eliminated in the final play off by Eldense. In the 2023–24 season, still under the direction of Raúl González, they finished in tenth position.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

A diferencia de otras Ligas europeas y mundiales de fútbol, en España la regulación y normativas que afecta a los equipos filiales permiten que estos puedan actuar como clubes profesionales a todos los efectos —pudiendo competir en el mismo sistema de Liga que el resto de equipos—, en vez de jugar una Liga separada de equipos filiales. El Castilla no puede ascender a una categoría superior o igual del fútbol español a la del primer equipo, siendo esta la Primera División.[10]​\n\nPese a que históricamente siempre actuó como un club de fútbol más dentro de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) —y por lo tanto con los mismos derechos que cualquier otro— en cuanto a las competiciones a disputar,[n 4]​ en el año 1991 la Federación llevó a efecto un cambio en sus estatutos que afectó directamente a dichos equipos \"B\" o filiales. Desde ese momento se impidió la participación de estos equipos en la Copa del Rey,[11]​ —circunstancia aún vigente en la actualidad—, y que ha dejado al equipo madridista como único filial de España y primero del mundo en disputar la final del torneo de Copa doméstica,[n 5]​ en la que curiosamente se enfrentó a su primer equipo, el Real Madrid C. F.\n\nEntre sus logros deportivos destaca un campeonato de la Segunda División en la temporada 1983-84,[1]​ siendo el único filial español en conseguirlo, y el mencionado subcampeonato en la Copa del Rey de 1979-80 que perdió frente a su equipo matriz por 6-1.[1]​ Este logró vino con el honor de ser el primer equipo de inferior categoría que conseguía eliminar a cuatro equipos de la Primera División,[12]​,[n 6]​ otorgándole además el derecho a disputar la Recopa de Europa de la temporada 1980-81 al estar ya clasificado el primer equipo para disputar la Copa de Europa,[n 7]​ convirtiéndose en el único equipo filial en la historia del fútbol en Europa en disputar una competición en dicho continente.[n 8]​ Es además el mejor club filial por resultados deportivos de España.[13]​\n\nEl Castilla disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano localizado en la Ciudad Real Madrid,[14]​ —complejo deportivo del club situado en Valdebebas y comúnmente denominado como Ciudad Deportiva en referencia a las antiguas instalaciones—, construido en honor al presidente de honor del club D. Alfredo Di Stéfano Laulhé con una capacidad de 6500 espectadores.[15]​\n\nPese a que el equipo filial madridista es fundado oficialmente en 1972 como un club absolutamente dependiente del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol, ya durante la temporada 1931-32 aparece un Castilla F. C. formado por jugadores del Racing de Madrid, el desaparecido Sporting de Madrid y algunos antiguos jugadores madridistas donde se fogueaba a futuras promesas hasta que finalmente desaparece en 1933. ​\n\nParalelamente, el 16 de diciembre de 1930 los empleados de la compañía de seguros Plus Ultra fundan la sociedad polideportiva Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, con una masa social de 800 personas y secciones de baloncesto, rugby o remo entre otras.[16]​ El club también actuaba y hacía las funciones de equipo filial del club madridista junto a otras entidades como el Club Deportivo Pardiñas, la Sociedad Primitiva Amistad, la Sociedad Recreativa El Cafeto, la Sociedad Stadium Foot-ball Club, el Club Patria Balompié, el Imperio Foot-ball Club o la Sociedad Deportiva Leganés, sociedades dispuestas a suministrarle jugadores al club de Chamartín a cambio de diferentes ayudas para su progresión y subsistencia en algunos casos. ​ ​ A ellos se unieron después de la Guerra Civil otros como la Agrupación Deportiva Ferroviaria, o el Club Deportivo Mediodía como equipos ayudados por los madridistas en su devenir deportivo. ​[1]​\n\nOriginalmente el Real Madrid C. F. mantenía diversos acuerdos con varios clubes madrileños que le hacían las veces de cantera, de donde nutrirse de jugadores que le resultaran interesantes para su primer equipo, recibiendo material deportivo y ayudas económicas a cambio. Uno de esos equipos era la citada Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra y que en 1946 se fusiona con el Club Deportivo Cifesa con motivo del ascenso a la Tercera División y antes del ascenso a la Segunda División en apenas dos temporadas.[19]​ Uno año después estableció finalmente un acuerdo formal con el Real Madrid C. F. por el que pasó a convertirse en su club filial a cambio de las citadas ayudas prevaleciendo por encima del resto de clubes.\n\nDisputaba sus partidos tanto en su propio estadio, el Velódromo de Ciudad Lineal, como en el Estadio de Chamartín, recinto del primer equipo madridista,[16]​ y estuvo cerca del ascenso a la Primera División en la temporada 1959-60. Del club aparecen grandes figuras como José María Zárraga, Enrique Mateos, Ramón Grosso, o Miguel Muñoz, y el club se convierte en un equipo inestable tras subir y bajar de categoría en numerosas ocasiones. Tras muchos esfuerzos para retornar a la Segunda División y tras perder varias fases de ascenso en las temporadas 1963-64, 1965-66, 1966-67, y 1967-68, entró en dificultades financieras a comienzos de los años setenta, momento en el que cedió los derechos federativos de forma oficial y permanente al club madridista en 1972, y pasar a ser un club con dependencia total de los blancos.[1]​\n\nEl 21 de julio de 1972, al finalizar la temporada 1971-72, la A. D. Plus Ultra se disuelve por los malos resultados y es entonces cuando el Real Madrid, de mano de su presidente Santiago Bernabéu, adquiere los derechos deportivos y federativos del que a partir de entonces fue de manera oficial el nuevo filial madridista bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol, en honor de la región histórica de Castilla.[20]​\n\nAl año siguiente comenzó su andadura en la Tercera División donde se mantuvo hasta su ingreso en 1977 en la recién estrenada Segunda División \"B\" como tercera categoría del fútbol español. En ella se proclama subcampeón en el año de su estreno y así, en 1978, asciende finalmente a la Segunda División.[20]​\n\nEn la temporada 1979-80 fue subcampeón de la Copa del Rey disputando una histórica final contra el primer equipo del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Esta hazaña no ha sido igualada nunca, poseyendo el honor de ser el único equipo filial que haya disputado una final en la historia de la Copa pese a que perdería por 6-1. En las eliminatorias, el Castilla se deshizo del Extremadura, el AD Alcorcón, el Racing de Santander y a los entonces equipos de primera división, Hércules CF (tras levantar el 4-1 de la ida con un 4-0 en Madrid), el Athletic Club (al vencer en la vuelta en San Mamés por 1-2 y el empate sin goles en la capital), y a la Real Sociedad (con un resultado global de 3-2), que ese año terminaría siendo subcampeón de liga y la ganaría los dos años siguientes. En semifinales se enfrentó al Sporting de Gijón de Quini, tras vencer por 4-1 en el partido de vuelta, remontando un 2-0 de la ida.[1]​\n\nPor tal motivo, participó en la Recopa de Europa del siguiente año donde caería en la primera ronda frente al West Ham United, venciendo en el Santiago Bernabéu por 3-1, pero cayendo derrotado por 5-1 en Londres tras una prórroga.\n\nFue el periodista Julio César Iglesias el primero en usar el apelativo, en un artículo publicado por el diario El País el 14 de noviembre de 1983 titulado «Amancio y la quinta del Buitre».[21]​[22]​ En él, Iglesias hablaba de un grupo de cinco futbolistas que por entonces destacaban en el Castilla Club de Fútbol —filial del Real Madrid C. F.—, y que esa temporada se proclamó campeón de la Segunda División de España siendo el primer y único filial de la historia en conseguirlo.\n\nEl hecho se produjo en la temporada 1983-84 bajo la dirección de Amancio Amaro tras superar en la última jornada al Athletic Club, el Bilbao Athletic de Julio Salinas y Genar Andrinua que entrenaba José Ángel Iribar. El equipo estaba formado por la mítica generación de «La Quinta de El Buitre» que iba alternando su actuación en el filial con apariciones en la primera plantilla.[1]​ La misma estuvo formada por Emilio Butragueño —líder deportivo de la generación—, Míchel González, Miguel Pardeza, Manolo Sanchís y Rafael Martín Vázquez.\n\nLa expectación por ver a los jóvenes futbolistas era tal que en ocasiones disputaba sus partidos en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Sus partidos llevaban casi tantos espectadores como los partidos del primer equipo, como los partidos de Copa del Rey o frente al citado Bilbao Athletic con quien mantenía una gran rivalidad y disputa, y que llegaban a reunir hasta a ochenta mil espectadores.[24]​ Sus resultados además se vieron secundados por grandes actuaciones en la Copa del Rey, competición que disputó hasta la prohibición de la Federación a equipos filiales, y en donde eliminó a varios equipos de Primera División en sus participaciones.\n\nSanchís y Martín Vázquez fueron los primeros en debutar en la primera plantilla en Primera División, dándoles la oportunidad el entonces técnico Alfredo Di Stéfano. Fue en Murcia, el 4 de diciembre de 1983. A pesar de sus 18 años, ambos tuvieron una actuación destacada, y Sanchís incluso marcó el gol de la victoria. Unos días después, el 31 de diciembre de 1983, Pardeza disputó siete minutos con el primer equipo ante el Real Club Deportivo Español. El onubense —era el único integrante de la Quinta nacido fuera de Madrid— no tuvo la continuidad de Sanchís y Martín Vázquez, y completó la mayor parte de la temporada en el filial.[25]​\n\nApenas unos meses después, el 5 de febrero de 1984, debutó Emilio Butragueño en Cádiz. El Buitre saltó al terreno de juego cuando su equipo perdía 2-0 frente al Cádiz Club de Fútbol y revolucionó el partido con dos goles y una asistencia que culminaron la remontada madridista.[26]​\n\nMíchel fue el único que disputó toda la temporada 1983/84 en el Castilla C. F. y no le llegó la oportunidad de debutar en el primer equipo hasta el 2 de septiembre de 1984, coincidiendo con la primera jornada de la siguiente temporada.\n\nMientras Butragueño, Sanchís, Martín Vázquez y Míchel se consolidaron en el primer equipo, Pardeza militó en el Castilla durante toda la temporada 1984/85 y la 1985/86 fue cedido al Real Zaragoza. Un año después volvió a la disciplina madridista, pero en 1987 se desvinculó definitivamente del club blanco para regresar a Zaragoza.\n\nLos otros cuatro integrantes de la Quinta del Buitre convirtieron al club en uno de los mejores equipos de España y Europa durante la segunda mitad de los años 1980. Conquistaron, entre otros títulos, cinco campeonatos de Liga consecutivos (1985 a 1990), siendo la segunda vez que lo conseguía y el único club en lograrlo en la historia de la competición, una Copa de la Liga (1985), tres Supercopas de España (1988-90) y dos Copas de la UEFA (1985 y 1986).\n\nEn 1990, tras una normativa de la Federación Española que afectaba los equipos filiales, debe disolverse. Así ocurre el 1 de julio y desaparece como club pasando a ser equipo dependiente y adoptando la denominación de Real Madrid Deportivo, perdiendo además del nombre, su escudo original, y los nuevos los adoptaría ambos del primer equipo. Durante esos primeros años empiezan en el club su carrera como entrenadores dos antiguos futbolistas que pasaron por sus filas: Vicente del Bosque y Rafa Benítez. Los siguientes años alternaría descensos y ascensos entre la segunda y la segunda división \"B\" ya bajo el nombre de Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"B\" debido a normas federativas.[20]​\n\nFue entonces cuando surgirían en el equipo otros grandes talentos como Ismael Urzaiz, Santiago Cañizares, José María Gutiérrez Guti o Álvaro Benito entre otros, además de Raúl González o Iker Casillas, aunque estos últimos apenas disputaron uno y cuatro partidos en el equipo filial y fueron promocionados prematuramente al primer equipo. Grandes generaciones dentro del equipo permitieron que el filial disputase 18 temporadas en la Segunda División compitiendo con primeros equipos históricos del fútbol español. Durante la temporada 2004-2005, el equipo ascendió a la Segunda División de España, tras derrotar en la fase de ascenso al Zaragoza \"B\" y al UB Conquense en unos partidos que disputó como local en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[27]​\n\nPor esta razón, en el verano de 2005 la Federación Española de Fútbol le concedió la petición de cambio de nombre al de Real Madrid Castilla C. F.. Sin embargo, no logra recuperar su antiguo escudo bajo la dirección del nuevo presidente Francisco Moreno Cariñena.[n 9]​ En la temporada 2005-06, disputó las dos primeras jornadas como local en el estadio Santiago Bernabéu para luego disputar el resto de la temporada en la Ciudad Deportiva de Valdebebas. Los últimas dos jornadas como local ya las pudo disputar en el recién inaugurado Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano. En la dicha temporada consiguió mantenerse pero en la temporada 2006-07 perdió la categoría al finalizar 19.º, pese a contar con una de las mejores generaciones de futbolistas que dio la cantera, con hombres como Juan Mata, Roberto Soldado o Álvaro Negredo. Desde entonces se mantuvo un lustro en la Segunda División \"B\", sin conseguir ascender a la Segunda División.[1]​\n\nEn la temporada 2010-11, ya bajo la presidencia de Nicolás Martín-Sanz, el equipo consigue acceder a la fase de ascenso a segunda división, pero cae derrotado frente al fuerte C. D. Alcoyano —que finalmente logró subir de categoría— por 0-2 en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu y tras empatar 2-2 en la vuelta en Alcoy.[20]​ Al año siguiente, queda campeón del Grupo I, lo que le permite jugar la eliminatoria directa por el ascenso contra el Cádiz CF. En el partido de ida, el Castilla vence por 0-3 a domicilio, lo que le dejó a priori un partido cómodo para la vuelta en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano, al no poder disputarse en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu por encontrarse en reformas.[28]​ En el partido de vuelta, el Castilla resuelve la eliminatoria con un 5-1 y logra el ascenso a Segunda División tras lograr un resultado global de 8-1.[29]​\n\n Posteriormente, y con el ascenso ya logrado, disputó contra el C. D. Mirandés la final para dilucidar el campeón de la Segunda División \"B\". En ella, jugada a doble partido, el Castilla derrotó al conjunto castellano-leonés por un global de 6-0, conquistando así su cuarto título de esta categoría. En aquel equipo militaron futbolistas como Jesé Rodríguez y Álvaro Morata —referentes del grupo— Dani Carvajal, Nacho Fernández, Denís Chéryshev o Lucas Vázquez entre otros, formando otra de las mejores generaciones dadas por el club.\n\nEn la nueva temporada, el Real Madrid Castilla sorprende tanto por su acierto goleador, como por su debilidad defensiva, dejando ver en sus encuentros un gran número de goles,[30]​ aunque con el paso de los partidos se fue notando su crecimiento en la nueva categoría, demostrando la gran diferencia de competitividad respecto al año anterior.[31]​ Al final del curso, batió su mejor registro goleador en la categoría, superando al Castilla de la «Quinta del Buitre» alcanzando un total de setenta y un goles,[n 10]​ dos más que los logrados en la citada campaña 1983-84 donde se proclamó campeón de la categoría.[32]​\n\nAl año siguiente, la salida de muchos de los citados futbolistas de la plantilla propició que se hubiese de reestructurar el equipo por completo lo que unido a una gran escasez goleadora —en contraposición con el curso anterior— acarreó un mal arranque liguero,[33]​ que a su vez desencadenó la destitución al frente del equipo de Alberto Toril,[34]​ entrenador del mismo desde enero de 2011.\n\nSu sucesor en el cargo, José Manuel Díaz —hasta la fecha entrenador del segundo filial, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"C\"—, trajo nuevos aires que dieron con una mejoría en el conjunto que le permitió abandonar el último lugar de la clasificación merced a cuatro victorias consecutivas encadenadas, algo que no lograba el filial en la categoría de plata desde la temporada 1988-89.[35]​ Sin embargo, una mala racha de resultados en la recta final del campeonato terminó provocando el descenso del Castilla en la última jornada del campeonato.\n\nPara afrontar el regreso a la Segunda División, el club confirmó al histórico exfutbolista francés Zinedine Zidane al frente de la plantilla,[36]​ además de llevar a cabo una reestructuración en las categorías inferiores que propició la desaparición del hasta entonces segundo filial, con el propósito de reunir únicamente en el Castilla a los mejores candidatos de ambos equipos que pudieran llegar a formar parte de la primera plantilla madridista en el futuro.[37]​[38]​\n\nTras no conseguir disputar la fase de ascenso al finalizar quintos de su grupo, se llevaron a cabo contrataciones de futbolistas con gran proyección como Carlos Abad, además de promocionar a jugadores como Borja Mayoral, Marcos Llorente o José Carlos Lazo entre otros. El equipo, del que se hizo cargo a mitad de temporada Luis Miguel Ramis debido a la promoción de Zidane al primer equipo,[39]​ realizó una buena campaña merced sobre todo al acierto goleador de Mariano Díaz, autor de 25 tantos que ayudaron al equipo se proclamase por quinta vez en su historia campeón de grupo de la división. Ello le valió para disputar la fase de ascenso en la que cayó derrotado en la ruta de los campeones frente al Universidad Católica de Murcia Club de Fútbol por un global de 4-3 en una eliminatoria llena de polémica por la excesiva dureza y permisividad de los árbitros en favor del equipo murciano,[40]​[41]​ llevándole a disputar la segunda fase de ascenso. En ella cayó en la primera eliminatoria frente al Club Lleida Esportiu tras un 0-4 global que le impidió subir a la segunda categoría del fútbol español.[42]​\n\nEl equipo no volvió a tener oportunidad de ascenso hasta la temporada 2018-19, dirigidos por Manolo Díaz, en la que nuevamente fue eliminado en el primer cruce por el Fútbol Club Cartagena. Una victoria por 3-1 en la ida fue revertida por los cartageneros al vencer en la vuelta por 2-0 y clasificarse merced al gol en campo rival en el empate técnico 3-3.[43]​ Para la nueva temporada fue contratado el exjugador y excanterano Raúl González como entrenador, hasta entonces dirigiendo al juvenil \"B\". La dificultad para planificar la plantilla con mayoría de jugadores procedentes del primer equipo juvenil a comienzo de temporada condicionó la temporada,[44]​ situándose en mitad de la tabla de clasificación al final de la primera vuelta.\n\nA mitad del curso —tras una mejora del equipo— las competiciones se cancelaron por parte de la UEFA, la RFEF y la La Liga,[45]​[46]​[47]​ debido a un brote del coronavirus tipo 2 del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave, una pandemia global vírica[48]​ que llegó a Europa desde Asia,[49]​[50]​ provocando contagios, fallecimientos y retroceso económico. Tras una mejoría después de meses de confinamiento de la población para frenar los contagios, el gobierno decretó que las competiciones profesionales pudieran retomar su actividad sin público en las gradas, no así las del resto de categorías, dándose por finalizadas tal cual se encontrasen en ese momento las clasificaciones.[51]​ Así, el equipo finalizó séptimo el campeonato.\n\nTras la reanudación de las competiciones en la temporada 2020-21, el equipo finalizó subcampeón de su grupo y se clasificó para disputar el sistema de ascenso a las nuevas categorías del fútbol español tras una reestructuración de las mismas por parte de la RFEF de cara al curso 2021-22.[52]​ En la disputa del ascenso finalizó como tercero con lo que aseguró su plaza en la Primera Federación —categoría que sustituyó a la Segunda División \"B\"— y tuvo opción de subir a la Segunda División de España, pero fue eliminado en las semifinales por la Unión Deportiva Ibiza.[53]​\n\nFue así uno de los equipos que estrenó la nueva Primera Federación, encuadrado en el grupo II y también en temporada 2023–24 , aún bajo dirección de Raúl González, donde finalizó en décima posición.\n\nEn sus inicios como A. D. Plus Ultra el club filial poseía su propio uniforme al igual que el escudo. Este constaba de camiseta azul, pantalones blancos y medias azules. Así continuó, salvo pequeñas modificaciones aunque siempre manteniendo sus colores, hasta la temporada 1972, fecha en la que se disuelve para pasar a ser oficialmente el filial del Real Madrid y tener total dependencia de él. En su primera temporada el Castilla mantiene el color azul en su equipación, pero en 1973 cambia sus colores por los de su equipo matriz, con todos sus complementos de color blanco, manteniéndose inalterable, y evolucionando al igual que el del primer equipo, hasta la actualidad.\n\nEn sus inicios como A. D. Plus Ultra poseyó un escudo propio hasta que se cambió en 1972 —fecha en la que pasó a tener total dependencia del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol— por uno propio a semejanza del club madridista.\n\nCon las iniciales de Castilla Club de Fútbol entrelazadas como en el escudo del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, la sustitución de la \"M\" por la \"C\" del Castilla, con la banda morada atravesándolo, pero sin la corona real, y con la denominación del club alrededor de un fondo azul. A partir de 1990-91, tras la normativa de filiales de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol, el club pasa a usar el escudo del Real Madrid. Hubo un intento por recuperarlo en 2005 al igual que se recuperó el nombre, pero no se consiguió y el filial sigue usando el escudo del primer equipo.\n\nEl Real Madrid Castilla disputa sus encuentros como local en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano, situado en la Ciudad Real Madrid en Valdebebas. Fue inaugurado el 9 de mayo de 2006 y posee una capacidad de 6000 espectadores,[14]​ todos sentados, y unas dimensiones de 105 x 68 metros.[14]​ La capacidad del estadio se verá aumentada a los 25 000 espectadores cuando concluyan todas las fases de construcción previstas en la Ciudad Real Madrid.[54]​\n\nLa calefacción propia, con la que el recinto puede ser también utilizado si fuese conveniente como zona de entrenamiento del club y la cubierta movible del lateral son algunas de las más novedosas técnicas de que dispone el estadio, para favorecer tanto al club como a los medios informativos y los aficionados.[54]​\n\nEl estadio fue inaugurado con un encuentro entre el primer equipo, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol y el Stade de Reims, en honor a la final de la primera Copa de Europa, máxima competición de clubes europeos, que fue ganada por el equipo blanco por 6-1. El autor del primer gol fue Sergio Ramos en el minuto 14' tras un pase de Robinho.[55]​ Antes de dicho encuentro se jugó un partido que enfrentó al equipo de veteranos del club contra un combinado de veteranos de la selección española, que precedió al acto de presentación y homenaje al presidente de honor D. Alfredo Di Stéfano, emblemático jugador del club del que toma su nombre.[54]​\n\nUna estatua de bronce del citado exfutbolista preside el acceso al estadio, representando una de sus más conocidas estampas al celebrar un gol en las semifinales de la Copa de Europa de 1957-58 frente al Budapesti Vasas S. C. en el que anotó un triplete, en la que a la postre sería la tercera Copa de Europa consecutiva del club.[56]​\n\nAntiguamente y bajo la denominación de A. D. Plus Ultra disputaba sus partidos en el extinto Velódromo de Ciudad Lineal (renombrado Estadio Antonio Borrachero el 1 de abril de 1966), el antiguo campo donde el primer equipo del Real Madrid C. F. jugó como local en la temporada 1923-24. Fue adquirido en propiedad por el club en la temporada 1945-46 en su estreno en Tercera División.[20]​\n\nDesde la temporada 1972-73, fecha en la que el club es rebautizado y refundado oficialmente como filial madridista con el nombre de Castilla C. F., hasta la temporada 1991-92, el equipo disputó sus partidos como local en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[57]​ En la temporada 1992-93, el filial se movió a la antigua Ciudad Deportiva del Real Madrid.[58]​ Allí permaneció hasta agosto de 2004, cuando el equipo se trasladó de forma temporal a la Ciudad del Fútbol de Las Rozas para poder entrenar y jugar los partidos como local[59]​ mientras tenían lugar las obras de demolición de la antigua Ciudad Deportiva y construcción de la nueva. En octubre de 2005, se mudó definitivamente a Valdebebas, lugar de la actual Ciudad Deportiva del club: la Ciudad Real Madrid.[14]​\n\nPara la temporada 2020-21, dado que el primer equipo seguiría disputando sus encuentros como local en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano debido a las obras de remodelación que el club está acometiendo en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu y al hecho de que no se permitía el ingreso de público en los estadios de equipos profesionales en España por la pandemia de COVID-19, el Castilla pasó a jugar sus partidos en el campo 7 de la Ciudad Real Madrid.[60]​\n\nLa oficialmente denominada Ciudad Real Madrid es un complejo deportivo donde se encuentran las residencias de jugadores y los campos de entrenamiento de las distintas categorías de la sección de fútbol, además de las sedes de la radio y la televisión del club. Se encuentra situada en el Parque de Valdebebas, en el norte de Madrid, muy cercana al aeropuerto de Madrid-Barajas. Es inaugurada en el año 2005, en sustitución de la antigua Ciudad deportiva del Paseo de la Castellana, tras una recalificación de los terrenos en propiedad del club en una operación junto con el Ayuntamiento de Madrid.\n\nTiene una superficie de 1 200 000 metros cuadrados, de los que hasta el momento se han desarrollado unos 300 000. El complejo incluye además de las instalaciones médicas y de entrenamiento para el primer equipo y las secciones inferiores de fútbol, residencias y doce campos de juego, incluyendo el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano.[61]​\n\nA lo largo de su historia, el equipo madridista ha visto como el nombre del club variaba por diversas circunstancias hasta la denominación actual de Real Madrid Castilla Club de Fútbol, vigente desde 2005. El club filial se inició bajo el nombre de Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, cuando en 1947 se oficializa el acuerdo de colaboración con la entidad de seguros, y con el de Castilla Club de Fútbol tras su oficialización en 1972.\n\nA continuación se listan las distintas denominaciones de las que ha dispuesto el club a lo largo de su historia:\n• Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra: (1947-1972) Nombre bajo el acuerdo como filial con la A. D. Plus Ultra.\n• Castilla Club de Fútbol: (1972-1990) Oficialización y compra de los derechos como filial a la A. D. Plus Ultra.\n• Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"B\": (1991-2005) Cambio tras la normativa de la RFEF respecto a equipos filiales.\n• Real Madrid Castilla Club de Fútbol: (2005-Act.) Recuperación de la histórica denominación tras recibir el permiso de la RFEF.\n\nEl Castilla C. F. acumula en sus más de 66 años de historia como filial madridista numerosos trofeos nacionales. Entre sus mejores actuaciones destacan por importancia, una Liga —complementada con otras diez de divisiones inferiores— y un subcampeonato de la Copa del Rey que le permitió lograr el mayor logro deportivo de su historia: una participación en competición continental —concretamente en la Recopa de Europa y siendo equipo de Segunda División—, siendo el único filial en la historia del fútbol en lograr los tres citados honores.[62]​\n\nPosee tres récords únicos, el de único club militante de la Segunda División de España en disputar una competición europea en España, la Recopa de Europa en la temporada 1980-81 donde fue eliminado en treintaidosavos de final; el de único club filial europeo en disputar una competición internacional, la ya citada Recopa de Europa; y ser el único equipo filial en disputar una final de Copa del Rey. Estos dos últimos son inigualables al no estar ya permitida la participación de filiales tanto en competición europea como en la Copa del Rey.\n\nA raíz de su clasificación para la Recopa de Europa por su papel en la anterior Copa del Rey donde fue subcampeón tras enfrentarse al primer equipo, tanto la UEFA como la RFEF iniciaron un proceso de modificación de las normativas, efecto en la temporada 1990-91, para evitar que cualquier otro club filial pudiese participar tanto en competición nacional como internacional —a excepción de la Liga que le corresponda, siempre en divisiones inferiores a la de su primer equipo—.\n\nNota: en negrita competiciones vigentes en la actualidad. Indicado el récord del torneo\n\nSuma unos números a lo largo de sus participaciones ligueras que le han permitido colocarse en la vigesimosegunda posición histórica de la Segunda División, entre sus 172 participantes históricos,[n 11]​ superando a numerosos primeros equipos que pueden participar —a diferencia de los castillistas— en la máxima categoría del fútbol nacional. Es el mejor equipo filial en la historia del campeonato merced a sus 33 temporadas de participación,[n 12]​ y el único entre ellos en haberse proclamado campeón de la categoría,[63]​ la cual es su mejor resultado histórico. El peor lo sufrió en dos campañas, con un decimoctavo puesto.[n 13]​\n\nSu debut en Segunda División de produjo en la temporada 1949-50 en un partido frente a la Unión Deportiva Salamanca que finalizó con victoria del equipo filial madrileño —bajo su antigua denominación de A. D. Plus Ultra— por cuatro goles a tres. En lo referente a goleadas, el equipo logró su mejor victoria en la temporada 1960-61 cuando derrotó al Real Jaén Club de Fútbol por un contundente 11-0,[64]​ mientras que su peor resultado fue en la temporada 1988-89 cuando cayó derrotado frente a la Real Zaragoza por 7-0, quien fue el vencedor final de dicho torneo.[65]​\n\nEn la segunda competición por importancia, el Campeonato de España de Copa, lo disputó un total de treinta ocasiones antes de que la RFEF modificase los estatutos prohibiendo disputarla a los equipos filiales. Pese a ello, sumó un subcampeonato en 1979-80 como mejor resultado, que le permitió disputar la Recopa de Europa y ser el único equipo filial en disputarla en la historia del torneo. Su peor participación en Copa la repitió en diez ocasiones al ser eliminado en la primera ronda.[66]​\n\nDesde la temporada 1990-91 el Real Madrid Castilla C. F. no puede disputar la Copa del Rey debido a la nueva normativa de la RFEF sobre equipos filiales.\n\nHasta la temporada 1977-78 no existía la Segunda División \"B\" de fútbol en España por lo que la Tercera División —hasta entonces la tercera categoría del país—, pasó a convertirse en la cuarta categoría en detrimento de la nueva división creada. Del mismo modo, en 2021 hubo una nueva reestructuración en la que las nuevas categorías de la Federación conformaron un nuevo sistema. Así, la Segunda División \"B\" fue sustituida por la Primera Federación, y la Tercera por la Segunda División RFEF.\n\nLa Primera División y la Segunda División son las categorías profesionales de fútbol en España desde su creación en el año 1929, debido a la profesionalización de este deporte en 1925.\n\nEl equipo podría haber ascendido en tres ocasiones a la Primera División, pero por su condición de filial finalmente su derecho a ascender directamente o jugar la promoción de ascenso le correspodería al siguiente clasificado en la Liga. Estas fueron las temporadas de 1983-84, 1987-88 y 1995-96.\n\nAntes de ser nombrado Castilla C. F., por el primigenio Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra pasaron jugadores como José María Zárraga, Pedro Casado, José María Vidal, Fernando Serena, Goyo Benito, Enrique Mateos o Ramón Grosso, que posteriormente integraron e hicieron carrera en el primer equipo del club, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol,[67]​ así como otros jugadores internacionales reconocidos del fútbol patrio como Juan Manuel Villa, Feliciano Rivilla, Luis Aragonés, José Macías o Ángel Lanchas.[68]​\n\nMás tarde, por las filas del Real Madrid Castilla han pasado históricos jugadores del primer equipo procedentes de «la fábrica blanca» como: José Antonio Camacho, Isidoro San José, Isidro Díaz, García Hernández, Agustín Rodríguez, Ricardo Gallego, Francisco Pineda, José Manuel Ochotorena, Miguel Porlán Chendo, Emilio Butragueño, Míchel González, Martín Vázquez, Manolo Sanchís, Sebastián Losada, Raúl González, José María Gutiérrez Guti, Álvaro Benito, Iker Casillas, Paco Pavón, Álvaro Arbeloa, Esteban Granero, Rubén de la Red, Nacho Fernández, Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vázquez, Carlos Casemiro, Fede Valverde o Vinícius Júnior, así como futbolistas que han desarrollado el grueso de su carrera en otros equipos importantes como Juan Macua, Rafa Benítez, Juan Señor, Javier Castañeda, Javier Maté, Rafael García Cortés, Poli Rincón, Miguel Pardeza —integrante histórico de la «Quinta del Buitre»—, José Aurelio Gay, Enrique Velasco, Pepe Mel, Julio Llorente, Julen Lopetegui, José Luis Caminero, Santiago Cañizares, Ismael Urzaiz, Torres Mestre, Christopher Ohen, Mutiu Adepoju, Juan Esnáider, Luis Miguel Ramis, Dani García, José Luis Morales, Samuel Eto'o, Fernando Sanz —hijo de Lorenzo Sanz—, Luis García, Esteban Cambiasso, David Barral, Miguel Ángel Ferrer Mista, Alberto Rivera, Roberto Soldado —quien es el máximo goleador histórico del filial madridista—, Juanfran Torres, Iván Sánchez-Rico Riki, Diego López, Filipe Luís, Álvaro Negredo, Borja Valero, Juan Mata, Dani Parejo, Javi García, José Callejón, Álvaro Morata, Pablo Sarabia, o Álex Fernández, Jesé Rodríguez, Denís Chéryshev, Antonio Adán, Raúl de Tomás, Diego Llorente, Fernando Pacheco, Rubén Yáñez, Marcos Llorente, Borja Mayoral, Martin Ødegaard, Mario Hermoso, Achraf Hakimi o Sergio Reguilón como ejemplos.[67]​\n\nNota: En negrita los jugadores activos en el club.\n\nMerecen ser destacadas algunas generaciones de futbolistas del club como la generación que posteriormente conformó el «Madrid de los García» —plantilla subcampeona de la Copa de Europa que consiguió alcanzar la final del máximo torneo continental tras quince años de ausencia— o los integrantes de la «Quinta del Buitre» —equipo que conquistó cinco Ligas consecutivas y dos Copas de la UEFA—. En lo individual, los canteranos Emilio Butragueño y Raúl González fueron galardonados con dos Balones de Bronce el primero, y un Balón de Plata y un Bronze FIFA World Player el segundo.\n• Como exigen las normas de la RFEF, los dorsales de los futbolistas se comprenderán entre los números 1 y 23, reservando el 1 y el 13 para los guardametas. En caso de ser necesario un tercer guardameta con licencia en el primer equipo se le reservará el dorsal número 24. Del dorsal 25 en adelante serán a todos los efectos jugadores pertenecientes a equipos filiales o dependientes, y como tales, podrán compaginar partidos con ambos equipos. Dichos jugadores deberán portar un dorsal fijo en cada uno de los partidos que intervengan.\n• Según normativa UEFA, un canterano debe permanecer al menos tres años en edad formativa en el club (15-21 años) para ser considerado como tal. 72 ​\n• Los equipos de la Primera Federación no están limitados a tener en la plantilla un número máximo de jugadores sin pasaporte de la Unión Europea. Según normativa UEFA, cada club solo puede tener en plantilla un máximo de tres jugadores extracomunitarios que ocupen plaza de extranjero. La lista incluye sólo la principal nacionalidad de cada jugador, algunos de los jugadores no europeos tienen otra nacionalidad de algún país de la UE:\n• None Los precios no se incluye IVA o sumas por objetivos, ya que no han sido efectivos.\n\nEl vigente entrenador desde 2019 es Raúl González —quien fuera integrante tanto del filial como del primer equipo, además de ser el jugador con más partidos disputados como madridista (741) y su máximos goleador histórico al momento de su retirada profesional (323 goles)—.[75]​ Tras superar el curso de entrenador UEFA Pro[76]​ pasó a formar parte de las divisiones inferiores del club en donde fue desarrollando su labor como técnico por las diferentes categorías logrando varios campeonatos.[77]​ En la temporada 2019-20 se convierte en el primer entrenador del filial, y momentáneamente del juvenil tras suspenderse las competiciones por la pandemia de COVID-19, para proclamarse Campeón de Europa.[78]​ Retomadas las competiciones, el equipo obtuvo plaza en la nueva Primera Federación.\n\nEntre los entrenadores del club también figuran otros exjugadores del club como Antonio Ruiz, Manuel Sanchís, Juan Santisteban —quien más partidos dirigió—, Amancio Amaro —quien dirigió a la «Quinta del Buitre»—, Ramón Grosso, Vicente del Bosque, Mariano García Remón, Rafa Benítez, Francisco García Hernández, Toni Grande, Paco Buyo, Míchel González, Zinedine Zidane o Santiago Solari por citar algunos.[79]​ Antes de todos ellos, cuando el equipo era aún la Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, contó con ilustres exintegrantes del club como Antonio Bonet,[80]​ o Miguel Muñoz —antes de convertirse en el entrenador con más partidos dirigidos del primer equipo—.[81]​\n\nPese a que el club y sus competencias pertenecen al Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, el equipo filial ha contado con presidencia propia desde sus inicios hasta el año 1990. Tras dieciséis años sin presidente propio, y siendo el presidente de la entidad Florentino Pérez, instauró el 28 de julio de 2006 de nuevo el antiguo privilegio a Francisco Moreno Cariñena, socio de la entidad y compromisario desde 1982, nombrándole así primer máximo mandatario del filial blanco desde hacía décadas. El mandatario ya fue además directivo del Castilla desde 1988 hasta la llegada de Ramón Mendoza a la presidencia blanca. Este último fue sucedido en el cargo por Lorenzo Sanz.\n\nEn la actualidad la presidencia del equipo filial recae en Nicolás Martín-Sanz, tras suceder en el cargo al guadalajareño, quien obtuviese el cargo en el año 2009.\n\nA continuación se listan los presidentes de la historia del club filial:\n• None (2008).

He was a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1951. He was one of the founders of the Italian Republic and a central figure of the Italian political left from the 1920s to the 1960s.\n\nNenni was born in Faenza, in Emilia-Romagna. After his peasant parents died, he was placed in an orphanage by an aristocratic family. Every Sunday, he recited his catechism before the countess and if he did well, he received a silver coin, which he recalled as \"generous but humiliating\".[3]\n\nNenni was affiliated with the Italian Republican Party. In 1908, he became editor of a republican paper in Forlì. The socialist paper in the town was edited at the time by Benito Mussolini, later the Fascist dictator of Italy. In 1909 he entered political life by joining the Italian Republican party. Nenni was arrested in 1911 for his participation in a socialist protest against Italy's imperialistic war in Libya alongside Mussolini and was imprisoned for seven months.[4]\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, Nenni advocated the intervention of Italy in the war. In 1915, he volunteered for the Isonzo front. After he was wounded and sent home, he became an editor of the republican paper Mattine d'Italia. He defended Italy's participation in the war but tried not to alienate his socialist friends. In the last years of the war Nenni served at the front again.[4]\n\nWhen the war was over, Nenni founded, together with some disillusioned revolutionary ex-servicemen, a group called \"Fascio\", which was soon dissolved and replaced by a real Fascist body.[4] While the socialist Mussolini became a fascist, the republican Nenni joined the Socialist Party in 1921 after its split with the wing that would form the Italian Communist Party (PCI).\n\nIn 1923, after the Fascist March on Rome, Nenni became the editor of PSI's official organ, Avanti!, and engaged in antifascist activism. In 1925 he was arrested for publishing a booklet on the fascist murder of Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti. When the Avanti offices were set aflame and the paper prohibited in 1926, he took refuge in France, where he became secretary of the PSI.\n\nNenni had worked in Paris as a correspondent of the Avanti in 1921 and had become acquainted with Léon Blum, Marcel Cachin, Romain Rolland and Georges Sorel. During his Parisian exile, Nenni made a decisive contribution to the survival of the Italian Socialist Party, which had moved abroad, and he worked for an alliance between the various anti-fascist parties which had been driven into exile. In 1935, he helped lead the Italian opposition to Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. Nenni went on to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was the co-founder and the political commissar of the Garibaldi Brigade. After the defeat of the Spanish Republic and the victory of General Francisco Franco he returned to France. In 1943, he was arrested by the Germans in Vichy France and then imprisoned in Italy on the island of Ponza.\n\nNenni's third daughter, Vittoria, was active in the French resistance. She was captured and deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered on 15 July 1943, aged 28.[5] After being liberated in August 1943, he returned to Rome to lead the Italian Socialist Party, which had been reunified as the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity. After the surrender of Italy with the Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, he was one of the political officials of the National Liberation Committee, the underground political entity of Italian Partisans during the German occupation.\n\nIn 1944, Nenni became the national secretary of the PSI again, favoring close ties between his party and the PCI. After the Liberation, he took up government responsibilities, becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Constituent Assembly in the government of Ferruccio Parri and the first government of Alcide De Gasperi. He was Minister for the Constitution, and in October 1946 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the second De Gasperi government.\n\nThe close ties between the PSI and the PCI caused the Giuseppe Saragat-led anti-communist wing of the PSI to leave and form the Italian Socialist Workers' Party in 1947 (later merged into the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, PSDI). During the early stage of the cold war he opposed Italy's entry into NATO fearing that it could drag the country into a war between the two Superpowers and reignite the Italian civil war and instead favoured a policy of Neutrality. In 1951 he was awarded the Stalin peace prize.\n\nIn 1956, Nenni broke with the PCI after Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary.[6] He returned the award and donated the Prize money ($25,000) to the International red Cross.[3] Subsequently, he slowly led his party into supporting membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and he sought co-operation with the leading party, the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Nenni facilitated an \"opening to the centre-left\" enabling coalition governments between the PSI and the Christian Democrats and leading the socialists back into office for the first time since 1947.[7] He formed a centre-left coalition with Saragat, Aldo Moro and Ugo La Malfa, and favored a reunion with the PSDI. From 1963 to 1968 he was Deputy Prime Minister in the three successive governments led by Moro and in December 1968 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the first government of Mariano Rumor, but resigned in July 1969, when the center-left alliance collapsed.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough the reunification attempts between the socialists and Giuseppe Saragat's breakaway Social Democrats resulted in the formation of a joint list Unified PSI–PSDI, both parties fared poorly in the 1968 Italian general election. In 1969, a disillusioned Nenni virtually retired and Francesco De Martino took his place.[8] He resigned as head of the PSI and was made a senator for life in 1970 and in 1971 he ran unsuccessfully for President of Italy. He died in Rome on 1 January 1980. She is commemorated in the writings of Charlotte Delbo.[citation needed] He was an atheist.[9]\n• Address given by Pietro Nenni on the military intervention in Czechoslovakia, Rome, 29 August 1968\n• Newspaper clippings about Pietro Nenni in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBWPietro Nenni - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Pietro Sandro Nenni (Faenza, 9 de febrero de 1891 - Roma, 1 de enero de 1980) fue un político socialista italiano.[1]​\n\nNacido en Faenza, en la provincia de Ravenna, de una familia modesta: sus padres José y Angela Castellani estaban al servicio de los condes de Ginnasi.\n\nNenni quedó huérfano de padre cuando tenía solo cinco años (1896).\n\nNenni fue periodista y posteriormente se convirtió en político. En 1911 fue encarcelado por organizar una manifestación en contra de la invasión italiana de Libia. En su estancia en la cárcel conoció a Benito Mussolini. En 1921 se afilió al Partido Socialista Italiano (PSI). En 1922 como redactor jefe del periódico Avanti!, atacó duramente a Mussolini que había llegado ese mismo año al poder. El periódico fue definitivamente clausurado en 1926 y Nenni se exilió a Francia, siendo elegido secretario general del PSI.\n\nEn 1936 participó en la guerra civil española como comisario político de la Brigada Garibaldi.[2]​\n\nDespués de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y de nuevo en Italia, ocupó distintos cargos gubernamentales, entre ellos los de vicepresidente del consejo de ministros (1945-1946) y Ministro de Asuntos Exteriores (1946-1947). Como consecuencia de la división del PSI, Nenni se quedó a la cabeza del bando más a la izquierda, aliándose con los comunistas, con los que rompió en 1957 debido a la invasión de Hungría.\n\nEn 1963, su entrada como vicepresidente de un gobierno de centro-izquierda originó la escisión del ala izquierda socialista que dio nacimiento al PSIUP. ​ Tras la reunificación en 1966, fue elegido presidente del partido y ocupó nuevamente el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores en 1968. En 1969 dimitió de todos sus cargos al salir derrotada en el congreso del partido su moción favorable a la continuación de la alianza centro-izquierda.\n\nEn 1970, fue nombrado senador vitalicio. Años más tarde volvió a presidir el Partido Socialista y en 1978 se presentó con este partido como candidato para la presidencia de la República.Pietro Nenni | Socialist leader, Italian statesman, anti-fascist | Britannica: Pietro Nenni (born February 9, 1891, Faenza, Italy—died January 1, 1980, Rome) was a journalist and politician who was leader of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), twice foreign minister, and several times vice-premier of Italy.\n\nThe son of a peasant, Nenni first became a journalist. When Italy invaded Libya in September 1911, Nenni organized a strike against the campaign. He was jailed for his activities and met Benito Mussolini in prison. He joined the PSI in 1921. In 1922, when Mussolini came to power, Nenni, an ardent antifascist, attacked him in the newspaper Avanti, of which he was chief editor. In 1925 he was arrested for publishing a booklet on the Fascists’ murder of Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti, and in the following year, after the suppression of Avanti, he fled to Paris. During the Spanish Civil War, Nenni was cofounder and political commissar of the Garibaldi Brigade. In 1940 he was arrested in Vichy France by the German Gestapo, taken back to Italy in 1943, and interned on the island of Ponza by Mussolini. In August of the same year, he was released by order of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. Nenni was then elected secretary-general of the PSI and in 1945 became vice-premier in the government of Feruccio Parri. Elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1946, he became vice-premier again in Christian Democrat Alcide De Gasperi’s coalition government. In 1946 Nenni was named foreign minister, but in January 1947 the PSI split and Nenni, heading the party’s left wing, made an alliance with the Communists. For almost a decade the alliance opposed Christian Democrat governments.\n\nNenni broke with the Communists after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. In 1963 he finally brought the PSI back into a full-fledged coalition with the Christian Democrats under Aldo Moro. He served as foreign minister in 1968–69 and was vice-premier in three successive cabinets, but, when the centre-left alliance collapsed in 1969, Nenni resigned as head of the PSI. Nenni was made a senator for life in 1970.Fondazione Pietro Nenni: An analysis of policies to empower labour in the digital workplacePremier League Football News, Fixtures, Scores & Results: Who is Man City's new signing Vitor Reis and how will he fit in?\n\nOpta Analyst's Oliver Hopkins looks at the Brazilian centre-back's stats and story so far1951 - Wikipedia: 阳金虎年\n\n(male Iron-Tiger)\n\n2077 or 1696 or 924\n\n — to —\n\n阴金兔年\n\n(female Iron-Rabbit)\n\n2078 or 1697 or 925The 1951 Refugee Convention: Refugees are in extremely vulnerable circumstances, lacking the protection of their own countries and facing immense challenges to their safety and well-being.

It consists of chips of marble, quartz, granite, glass, or other suitable material, poured with a cementitious binder (for chemical binding), polymeric (for physical binding), or a combination of both. Metal strips often divide sections, or changes in color or material in a pattern. Additional chips may be sprinkled atop the mix before it sets. After it is cured it is ground and polished smooth or otherwise finished to produce a uniformly textured surface. \"Terrazzo\" is also often used to describe any pattern similar to the original terrazzo floors.[1] Modern forms of terrazzo include polished concrete.\n\nAlthough the history of terrazzo can be traced back to the ancient mosaics of Egypt, its more recent predecessors come from Italy. The form of terrazzo used today derives partly from the 18th century pavimento alla Veneziana (Venetian pavement) and the cheaper seminato. Pavimento alla Veneziana had workers place marble fragments next to each other in a mortar base. Terrazzo is also related to the technique seminato for which workers tossed larger marble chips into the cement that was then ground and polished. Together, these methods create the generic form of terrazzo that involves pieces of stone that are bonded to a cement bed. Terrazzo was first introduced in the United States in the late 1890s, but did not achieve popularity until the 1920s.[2] Until then it was hand polished with a long handled tool called a galera.[2] Due to its likelihood of cracking, terrazzo was used at a small scale in comparison to the large expanses we see today. Two inventions resulted in its rise in popularity: divider strips and the electric grinding machine. The invention of divider strips by L. Del Turco and Bros. in 1924 contained the cracking of terrazzo by allowing the material greater space to expand and shrink after installation. This invention made terrazzo a durable and reliable material in addition to allowing for further design work within the floor.[3] Installers use the dividing strips as guides when they work with different colored terrazzo. Additionally, the electric grinding machine and mechanization of the production process cut down on costs and installation time, making terrazzo an affordable flooring option.\n\nArt Deco and Moderne styles from the 1920s to 1940s favored terrazzo with the dividers allowing for straight or curved lines that increased the decorative potential.[4] The popularity of terrazzo led to an increase in installers in the 1920s. The National Terrazzo and Mosaic Organization was formed in 1931 to further professionalize the practice of terrazzo installation.[5] One of the best-known examples of terrazzo is the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Created in 1958, the walk honors celebrities in the form of a terrazzo star that displays their name.[6]\n\nArchaeologists have adopted the term terrazzo to describe the floors of early Neolithic buildings (PPNA and PPNB, ca. 9,000–8,000 BC) in Western Asia constructed of burnt lime and clay, colored red with ochre and polished. The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance. The use of fire to produce burnt lime, which was also used for the hafting of implements, predates production of fired pottery by almost a thousand years.[citation needed] In the early Neolithic settlement of Çayönü in eastern Turkey about 90 m2 (970 sq ft) of terrazzo floors have been uncovered. The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevalı Çori measure about 80 m2 (860 sq ft). They are 15 cm (5.9 in) thick, and contain about 10–15% lime.\n\nThese floors are almost impenetrable to moisture and very durable, but their construction involved a high input of energy. Gourdin and Kingery (1975) estimate that the production of any given amount of lime requires about five times that amount of wood.[7][clarification needed] Recent experiments by Affonso and Pernicka[8] have shown that only twice the amount is needed, but that would still amount to 4.5 metric tonnes of dry wood for the floors in Çayönü. Other sites with terrazzo floors include Nevalı Çori, Göbekli Tepe, Jericho, and Kastros (Cyprus).\n\nTerrazzo artisans create walls, floors, patios, and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is 3 to 4 inches (76 to 102 mm) deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a 1 inch (25 mm) layer of sandy concrete. Before this layer sets, terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo. For the final layer, terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented. While the mixture is still wet, workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a weighted roller (100–125 pounds (45–57 kg)) over the entire surface.\n\nIn the 1970s, polymer-based terrazzo was introduced and is called thin-set terrazzo. Initially polyester and vinyl ester resins were used as the binder resin. Today, most of the terrazzo installed is epoxy terrazzo. The advantages of this material over cementitious terrazzo include a wider selection of colors, 1⁄4 to 3⁄8 inch (6.4 to 9.5 mm) installation thickness, lighter weight, faster installation, impermeable finish, higher strength, and less susceptibility to cracking. The disadvantage of epoxy resin–based terrazzo is that it can only be used for interior, not exterior, applications. Epoxy-based terrazzo will lose its color and slightly peel when used outdoors, whereas cement-based terrazzo will not. In addition to marble aggregate blends, other aggregates have been used, such as mother of pearl and abalone shell. Recycled aggregates include: glass, porcelain, concrete, and metal. Shapes and medallions can be fabricated on site by bending divider strips, or off site by water-jet cutting.\n\nWhen the terrazzo is thoroughly cured, helpers grind it with a terrazzo grinder, which is somewhat like a floor polisher, only much heavier. Slight depressions left by the grinding are filled with a matching grout material and hand-troweled for a smooth, uniform surface; it is then cleaned, polished, and sealed.[9]\n\nTerrazzo installation includes both bonded and unbonded methods. Bonded systems include: bonded underbed, monolithic, chemically bonded, and the most recent, thin set method (epoxy resin). Bonded terrazzo is applied over a sand-cement mortar underbed which sits on top of a concrete slab. The sand-cement layer allows for variations in the finished concrete slab that it sits on. Monolithic terrazzo is applied directly over an extremely flat and high quality concrete sub-floor. Thin-set terrazzo does not require a concrete sub-floor. Instead, a flexible membrane can be installed so that cracks do not appear on the surface.[10] Unbonded includes the sand cushion method which uses wire reinforcing, an isolation sheet, and sand dusting that absorbs any movement from the concrete slab.[11]\n\nAlthough terrazzo derives from the mosaic artform, it does not necessarily place individual pieces in a decorative pattern. Instead, small pieces are thrown into the mortar base creating a more uniform surface appearance. Decorative patterns are often created by using dividers which creates lines between different colored terrazzo mixtures.\n\nCracking is a common form of failure and is often caused by the structural system that supports the terrazzo rather than the material itself. Contact with alkalis or acids can deteriorate the bonding agents used in terrazzo. As the aggregates are often marble dust which is calcium carbonate, strong acid can also cause deterioration to the aggregates. When partial replacement is necessary, a \"bracketing\" system mixing and matching different chips is used to create potential matches.[11] Aged terrazzo can be resurfaced to restore its original look by re-polishing.[12]The Terrazzo: The main buildings in the Cadet Area surround a large pavilion known as The Terrazzo, designed by landscape architect Dan Kiley. The name comes from the walkway’s terrazzo tiles that are set among a checkerboard of marble strips.\n\nWith the building of Sijan Hall on the south side of the Terrazzo in 1968, the Terrazzo area was enclosed, creating a large quadrangle. Only the top of the hill, now known as “Spirit Hill,” remains in the central grassy area of the Terrazzo. At the east end of the Terrazzo are the “Air Gardens,” 700-feet of lighted pools, lowered grass sections and maze-like walkways.\n\nSeveral retired aircraft now call the Terrazzo home, including:\n\nThis 1976 model F-15 flew most of its career with the 48th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (FIS) at Langley AFB, VA. The 48 FIS flew the jet on intercept missions for the Southeast Air Defense Sector. The jet was painted in the colors of Tyndall AFB, FL, for its last few missions before it was retired on 30 November 1992. It was donated in 1993.\n\nThis is the only aircraft credited with six MiG kills since the Korean War. Captain Richard S. Ritchie, Class of 1964, made his first and fifth kills in this aircraft. It was presented to the Academy in 1986.Township of Verona NJ - Home - New: Get it DoneVerona, WI - Official Website | Official Website: \n• Century School Park Ice Rink: Rental Skates are now available!

The metropolitan area of Verona covers an area of 1,426 km2 (550.58 sq mi) and has a population of 714,310 inhabitants.[4] It is one of the main tourist destinations in Northern Italy because of its artistic heritage and several annual fairs and shows as well as the opera season in the Arena, an ancient Roman amphitheater.\n\nBetween the 13th and 14th centuries, the city was ruled by the della Scala family. Under the rule of the family, in particular of Cangrande I della Scala, the city experienced great prosperity, becoming rich and powerful and being surrounded by new walls.[5] The della Scala era is preserved in numerous monuments around Verona.\n\nTwo of William Shakespeare's plays are set in Verona: Romeo and Juliet (which also features Romeo's visit to Mantua) and The Two Gentlemen of Verona. It is unknown if Shakespeare ever visited Verona or Italy, but his plays have lured many visitors to Verona and surrounding cities. Verona was also the birthplace of Isotta Nogarola, who is said to be the first major female humanist and one of the most important humanists of the Renaissance.[6] In November 2000, the city was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO because of its urban structure and architecture.\n\nThe city is scheduled to host the 2026 Winter Olympics closing ceremonies.\n\nThe precise details of Verona's early history remain a mystery along with the origin of its name. One theory is that it was a city of the Euganei, who were obliged to give it up to the Cenomani (550 BC). With the conquest of the Valley of the Po, the Veronese territory became Roman about 300 BC. Verona became a Roman colonia in 89 BC. It was classified as a municipium in 49 BC, when its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Poblilia or Publicia.\n\nThe city became important because it was at the intersection of several roads. Stilicho, a military commander in the Roman army, defeated Alaric and his Visigoths here in 402. Later, Verona was conquered by the Ostrogoths in 489, and the Gothic domination of Italy began. Theoderic the Great was said to have built a palace there. It remained under the power of the Goths throughout the Gothic War (535–552), except for a single day in 541, when the Byzantine officer Artabazes made an entrance. The defections of the Byzantine generals over the booty made it possible for the Goths to regain possession of the city. In 552 the Romans under the general Valerian vainly endeavored to enter the city, but it was only when the Goths were fully overthrown that they surrendered it.[7]\n\nIn 569, it was taken by Alboin, King of the Lombards,[8] in whose kingdom it was, in a sense, the second most important city. There, Alboin was \"killed by his own people with the connivance of his wife\" in 572.[9] The dukes of Treviso often resided there. Adalgisus, son of Desiderius, in 774 made his last resistance in Verona to Charlemagne, who had destroyed the Lombard kingdom.[10] Verona became the ordinary residence of the kings of Italy, the government of the city becoming hereditary in the family of Count Milo, progenitor of the counts of San Bonifacio. From 880 to 951 the two Berengarii resided there.\n\nUnder Holy Roman and Austrian rule, Verona was alternatively known in German as Bern, Welsch-Bern[11] or Dietrichsbern. Otto I ceded to Verona the marquisate dependent on the Duchy of Bavaria, however, the increasing wealth of the burgher families eclipsed the power of the counts, and in 1135 Verona was organised as a free commune. In 1164 Verona joined with Vicenza, Padua and Treviso to create the Veronese League, which was integrated with the Lombard League in 1167 to battle against Frederick I Barbarossa. Victory was achieved at the Battle of Legnano in 1176, and the Treaty of Venice signed in 1177 followed by the Peace of Constance in 1183.[12]\n\nWhen Ezzelino III da Romano was elected podestà in 1226, he converted the office into a permanent lordship. In 1257 he caused the slaughter of 11,000 Paduans on the plain of Verona (Campi di Verona).[clarification needed] Upon his death, the Great Council elected Mastino I della Scala as podestà, and he converted the \"signoria\" into a family possession, though leaving the burghers a share in the government. Failing to be re-elected podestà in 1262, he affected a coup d'état, and was acclaimed Capitano del Popolo, with the command of the communal troops. Long internal discord took place before he succeeded in establishing this new office, to which was attached the function of confirming the podestà. In 1277, Mastino della Scala was killed by the faction of the nobles.\n\nThe reign of his son Alberto della Scala as capitano (1277–1302) was a time of incessant war against the counts of San Bonifacio, who were aided by the House of Este. Of his sons, Bartolomeo, Alboino and Cangrande I della Scala (1291–1329), only the last shared the government (1308); he was great as warrior, prince, and patron of the arts; he protected Dante, Petrarch, and Giotto. By war or treaty, he brought under his control the cities of Treviso (1308), Vicenza (1311), and Padua (1328). At that time before the Black Death, the city was home to more than 40,000 people.[13]\n\nCangrande was succeeded by Mastino II (1329–1351) and Alberto, sons of Alboino. Mastino continued his uncle's policy, conquering Brescia in 1332 and carrying his power beyond the Mincio. He purchased Parma (1335) and Lucca (1339). After the King of France, he was the richest prince of his time. A powerful league was formed against him in 1337 – Florence, Venice, the Visconti, the Este, and the Gonzaga. After a three-year war, the Scaliger dominions were reduced to Verona and Vicenza (Mastino's daughter Regina-Beatrice della Scala married to Barnabò Visconti). Mastino's son Cangrande II (1351–1359) was a cruel, dissolute, and suspicious tyrant; not trusting his own subjects, he surrounded himself with Brandenburgian mercenaries. He was killed by his brother Cansignorio (1359–1375), who beautified the city with palaces, provided it with aqueducts and bridges, and founded the state treasury. He also killed his other brother, Paolo Alboino. Fratricide seems to have become a family custom, for Antonio (1375–1387), Cansignorio's natural brother, slew his brother Bartolomeo, thereby arousing the indignation of the people, who deserted him when Gian Galeazzo Visconti of Milan made war on him. Having exhausted all his resources, he fled from Verona at midnight on 19 October 1387, thus putting an end to the Scaliger domination, which, however, survived in its monuments.\n\nThe year 1387 is also the year of the Battle of Castagnaro, fought between Giovanni Ordelaffi for Verona and John Hawkwood for Padua. The latter emerged as the winner.\n\nAntonio's son Canfrancesco attempted in vain to recover Verona (1390). Guglielmo (1404), natural son of Cangrande II, was more fortunate; with the support of the people and the Carraresi, he drove out the Milanese, but he died ten days after. After a period of Cararrese rule, Verona submitted to Venice (1405). The last representatives of the Scaligeri lived at the imperial court and repeatedly attempted to recover Verona by the aid of popular risings.\n\nFrom 1508 to 1517, the city was in the power of the Emperor Maximilian I. There were numerous outbreaks of the plague, and in 1629–1633, Italy was struck by its worst outbreak in modern times. Around 33,000 people died in Verona (over 60% of the population at the time) in 1630–1631.[14]\n\nIn 1776, a method of bellringing was developed called Veronese bellringing art. Verona was occupied by Napoleon in 1797, but on Easter Monday the populace rose and drove out the French. It was then that Napoleon made an end of the Venetian Republic. Verona became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. It was taken from Austria by the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 and became part of Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy, but was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia.\n\nThe Congress of Verona, which met on 20 October 1822, was part of the series of international conferences or congresses, opening with the Congress of Vienna in 1814–1815, that marked the continuing enforcement of the \"Concert of Europe\".\n\nIn 1866, following the Third Italian War of Independence, Verona, along with the rest of Venetia, became part of a united Italy.\n\nThe advent of fascism added another dark chapter to the annals of Verona. Throughout Italy, the Jewish population was hit by the Manifesto of Race, a series of anti-Semitic laws passed in 1938, and after the invasion by Nazi Germany in 1943, deportations to Nazi concentration camps. An Austrian Fort (now a church, the Santuario della Madonna di Lourdes), was used to incarcerate and torture Allied troops, Jews and anti-fascists, especially after 1943, when Verona became part of the Italian Social Republic.\n\nDuring Austrian rule Verona became of great strategic importance to the regime. Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini's son-in-law, was accused of plotting against the republic; in a show trial staged in January 1944 by the Nazi and fascist hierarchy at Castelvecchio (the Verona trial), Ciano was executed on the banks of the Adige with many other officers on what is today Via Colombo. This marked another turning point in the escalation of violence that would only end with the final liberation by allied troops and partisans on 26 April 1945.\n\nAfter World War II, as Italy joined the NATO alliance, Verona once again acquired its strategic importance, due to its geographical closeness to the Iron Curtain. The city became the seat of SETAF (South European Allied Terrestrial Forces) and had during the whole duration of the Cold War period a strong military presence, especially American, which has since decreased.\n\nVerona has a humid subtropical climate characteristic of Northern Italy's inland plains, with hot summers and cool, humid winters, even though Lake Garda has a partial influence on the city.[15] The relative humidity is high throughout the year, especially in winter when it causes fog, mainly from dusk until late morning, although the phenomenon has become less and less frequent in recent years.\n\nIn 2009, 265,368 people were residing in Verona, located in the province of Verona, Veneto, of whom 47.6% were male and 52.4% were female. Minors (children aged 0–17) totaled 16.05% of the population compared to pensioners who numbered 22.36%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The average age of Verona residents is 43 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Verona grew by 3.05%, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%.[21] The current birth rate of Verona is 9.24 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.\n\nAs of 2009 , 87% of the population was Italian.[22] The largest immigrant group comes from other European nations (the largest coming from Romania): 3.60%, South Asia: 2.03%, and sub-saharan Africa 1.50%. The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, but due to immigration now has some Orthodox Christian, and Muslim followers.\n\nSince the local government political reorganization in 1993, Verona has been governed by the City Council of Verona, which is based in Palazzo Barbieri. Voters elect directly 33 councilors and the mayor of Verona every five years.\n\nVerona is also the capital of its own province. The Provincial Council is seated in Palazzo del Governo. The current mayor of Verona is Damiano Tommasi, elected on 26 June 2022.[23]\n\nVerona has traditionally been a right-wing traditionalist Catholic city, reflecting its former status as one of the major cities of Italian Social Republic, and the right-wing politics of the Veneto region. In October 2018, Verona became the first city in Italy to declare itself pro-life, and hosted the American Christian right lobby group World Congress of Families' conference in 2019.[24][25][26] Despite this, since the mayors became directly elected in 1994, the city has elected two left-wing mayors - Paolo Zanotto in 2002 and current mayor Damiano Tommasi in 2022, largely due to incumbent mayor Federico Sboarina's refusal to include center-right parties in his right-wing coalition.[27]\n\nBecause of the value and importance of its many historical buildings, Verona has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Verona preserved many ancient Roman monuments (including the magnificent Arena) in the early Middle Ages, but many of its early medieval edifices were destroyed or heavily damaged by the earthquake of 3 January 1117, which led to a massive Romanesque rebuilding. The Carolingian period Versus de Verona contains an important description of Verona in the early medieval era.\n\nThe Roman military settlement in what is now the center of the city was to expand through the cardines and decumani that intersect at right angles. This structure has been kept to the present day and is clearly visible from the air. Further development has not reshaped the original map. Though the Roman city with its basalt-paved roads is mostly hidden from view it stands virtually intact about 6 m below the surface. Most palazzi and houses have cellars built on Roman structures that are rarely accessible to visitors.\n\nVerona is famous for its Roman amphitheater, the Arena, found in the city's largest piazza, the Piazza Bra. Completed around 30 AD, it is the third-largest in Italy after Rome's Colosseum and the Amphitheatre of Capua. It measures 139 meters long and 110 meters wide, and could seat some 25,000 spectators in its 44 tiers of marble seats. The ludi (shows and gladiator games) performed within its walls were so famous that they attracted spectators from far beyond the city. The current two-story façade is actually the internal support for the tiers; only a fragment of the original outer perimeter wall in white and pink limestone from Valpolicella, with three stories remains. The interior is very impressive and is virtually intact, and has remained in use even today for public events, fairs, theatre, and open-aired opera during warm summer nights.\n\nPiazza delle Erbe, near the Roman forum was rebuilt by Cangrande I and Cansignorio della Scala I, lords of Verona, using material (such as marble blocks and statues) from Roman spas and villas.\n\nThere is also a variety of other Roman monuments to be found in the town, such as the Roman theatre of Verona. This theatre was built in the 1st century BC, but through the ages had fallen in disuse and had been built upon to provide housing. In the 18th century Andrea Monga, a wealthy Veronese, bought all the houses that in time had been built over the theatre, demolished them, and saved the monument. Not far from it is the Ponte di Pietra (\"Stone Wall Bridge\"), another Roman landmark that has survived to this day.\n\nThe Arco dei Gavi was built in the 1st century AD and is famous for having the name of the builder (architect Lucius Vitruvius Cordone) engraved on it, a rare case in the architecture of the epoque. It originally straddled the main Roman road into the city, now Corso Cavour. It was demolished by French troops in 1805 and rebuilt in 1932.\n\nNearby is the Porta Borsari, an archway at the end of Corso Porta Borsari. This is the façade of a 3rd-century gate in the original Roman city walls. The inscription is dated 245 AD and gives the city name as Colonia Verona Augusta. Corso Porta Borsari, the road passing through the gate is the original Via Sacra of the Roman city. Today, it is lined with several Renaissance palazzi and the ancient Church of Santi Apostoli, a few meters from Piazza delle Erbe.\n\nPorta Leoni is the 1st century BC ruin of what was once part of the Roman city gate. A substantial portion is still standing as part of the wall of a medieval building. The street itself is an open archaeological site, and the remains of the original Roman street and gateway foundations can be seen a few feet below the present street level. As can be seen from there, the gate contains a small court guarded by towers. Here, carriages and travelers were inspected before entering or leaving the city.\n\nThe Santo Stefano church is dedicated to the first Christian martyr, was erected in the Paleochristian era, and houses the burials of the first bishops of Verona. Throughout the centuries Saint Stephen underwent complex architectural transformations. Particularly striking is the rare two-story ambulatory, probably built to give pilgrims visual access to the abundant collection of important relics for which the church was famous. Also to be visited is the cruciform crypt with its forest of columns, arches, and cross vaults. Saint Stephen was the first Christian martyr and, according to the Acts of the Apostles, was stoned just outside Jerusalem, in a place still remembered today, near the so-called \"Porta Leoni\".[28]\n\nThe Basilica of San Zeno Maggiore is a Romanesque style church, the third such structure on its site, built from 1123 to 1135, over the 4th-century shrine to Verona's patron saint, St. Zeno (bishop of Verona from 362 to 380[29] when he died). The façade dominates the large square, and is flanked with a 72-meter-tall bell tower, which is mentioned by Dante in Canto 18 of Purgatory in the Divine Comedy. The weathered Veronese stone gives a warm golden glow, and the restrained lines of the pillars, columns, and cornices, and the gallery with its double windows, give the façade an air of harmonious elegance. The huge rose window is decorated as a Wheel of Fortune. The lintels above the portal have carvings of the months of the year. Each side of the doorway is embellished with 18 bas-relief panels of biblical scenes, and the inner bronze door panels have 48 primitive but forceful depictions of Biblical scenes and episodes from the life of St Zeno. The meaning of some of the scenes is now unknown, but the extraordinarily vivid energy of the figures is a superb blend of traditional and Ottonian influences. The interior of the church is divided into the Lower Church, occupying about ⅔ of the structure, and the Upper Church, occupying the remainder. The walls are covered with 12th and 14th century frescos and the ceiling of the nave is a magnificent example of a ship's keel ceiling. The vaulted crypt contains the tomb of St. Zeno, the first Bishop of Verona, as well as the tombs of several other saints. North of the church is a pleasant cloister. The church also houses the tomb of King Pippin of Italy (777–810).\n\nPiazza dei Signori is an elegant medieval square with various buildings and towers. It has a monument dedicated to Dante Alighieri.\n\nThe Basilica of San Lorenzo is another Romanesque church, albeit smaller. It dates from around 1177, but was built on the site of a Paleochristian church, fragments of which remain. The church is built of alternating tracks of brick and stone, and has two cylindrical towers, housing spiral staircases to the women's galleries. The interior is sober but still quiet. The striped bands of stone and brick and the graceful arches complement the setting.\n\nSanta Maria Antica is a small Romanesque church that served as the private chapel of the Scaligeri clan, and is famous for the Gothic Scaliger Tombs.\n\nThe Verona Cathedral, also known as the Duomo, is a notable Romanesque church.\n\nSant'Anastasia is a huge and lofty church built from 1290 to 1481 by the Dominicans to hold the massive congregations attracted by their sermons. The Pellegrini chapel houses the fresco St. George and the Princess of Trebizond by Pisanello as well as the grave of Wilhelm von Bibra. An art festival is held in the square each May.\n\nThe Castelvecchio Bridge, also known as Ponte Scaligero, is a segmental arch bridge. At the time of its completion in 1356, it was the world's largest bridge arch. It has a span length of 48.70 m (159.78 ft).\n\nThe city has two professional football teams. Historically, the city's major team has been Hellas Verona. They won the Italian Serie A championship in 1984–85 and played in the European Cup the following year. Chievo Verona represented Chievo, a suburb of Verona, and was created in 1929. However, they ceased to exist in 2021 due to outstanding tax payments. As of the 2021–22 season, Hellas plays in the first division of Italian football, Serie A, while Virtus Verona, the other club in the city, plays in the Serie C. The teams of Hellas and Chievo contested the Derby della Scala and shared the 38,402-seater Stadio Marcantonio Bentegodi (now only home to Hellas due to the fold of Chievo), which was used as a venue at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.\n\nVerona is home to the volleyball team Verona Volley (now in Serie A1), the rugby team Franklin and Marshall Cus Verona Rugby (now in Serie A1), and the basketball team Scaligera Basket (now in Legadue).\n\nThe city has twice hosted the UCI Road World Championships, in 1999 (with Treviso as co-host) and in 2004. The city also regularly hosts stages of the Giro d'Italia annual cycling race. Verona also hosted the baseball world cup in 2009, and the Volleyball World Cup in September–October 2010. Verona is hosting the Volleyball Women's World Championship in September–October 2014.[30]\n\nPublic transit has been operated by the provincial public transport company, Azienda Trasporti Verona (ATV), since 2007. From 1884 to 1951, the city was served by the Verona tram network [it]. Trolleybuses replaced the trams which were themselves replaced by buses in 1975. A new trolleybus network is currently under construction by ATV and is expected to open in 2026.[31]\n\nAn incline lift, the Verona funicular, opened in 2017 and provides access from the Ponte Pietra to the Roman theatre museum and San Pietro Castle.\n\nVerona lies at a major route crossing where the north–south rail line from the Brenner Pass to Rome intersects with the east–west line between Milan and Venice, giving the city rail access to most of Europe. In addition to regional and local services, the city is served by direct international trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, and Munich. ÖBB nightjet provides overnight sleeper service via Verona on its La Spezia to Wien and München lines.[32]\n\nVerona's main station is Verona Porta Nuova railway station, to the south of the city center. It is considered to be the ninth busiest railway station in Italy, handling approximately 68,000 passengers per day, or 25 million passengers per year.[33]\n\nThere is a lesser station to the east of the city at Porta Vescovo, which used to be the main station in Verona, but now only receives trains between Venice and Porta Nuova.\n\nVerona Airport is located 10 km (6.2 mi) southwest of Verona. It handles around 3 million passengers per year. It is linked to Porta Nuova railway station by a frequent bus service.[33]\n\nThere are direct flights between Verona and Rome Fiumicino, Munich, Berlin, Moscow, Naples, Frankfurt, Catania, London Gatwick, Dublin, Palermo, Cork, Manchester, Liverpool[34] and Cagliari among others.\n• Paolo Bellasio (1554–1594), composer of the Renaissance; member of the Roman School\n• Paolo Caliari (1528–1588), well known as \"Veronese\", painter\n• Gigliola Cinquetti (born 1947), singer who brought Italy its first Eurovision Song Contest win in 1964\n• Damiano Cunego, former world number 1 cyclist and former Giro d'Italia winner\n• Girolamo Fracastoro, also known as Fracastorius, renowned scholar, physician, and poet\n• Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, fictional characters from Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet\n• Sara Simeoni, the former world high jump primatist and Olympic gold medalist\n• Achille Lauro, singer, rapper, and songwriter who represented San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022\n\nTwo of William Shakespeare's plays, Romeo and Juliet and The Two Gentlemen of Verona, are set in the city of Verona.[36][37] No evidence suggests that Shakespeare had ever been to the city. In May 2024, Pope Francis regarded Verona as the city of love.[38]\n• Idea Verona, an Italian language, art, and culture school for foreigners visiting or living in VeronaVerona: Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the Town Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the Town Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the Town Authentic Italian Cuisine in the Heart of the TownHome - Verona Area School District: Verona Area High School Graduation will take place on Sunday, June 8th, 2025.

The protagonist makes key decisions that affect the plot, primarily influencing the story and propelling it forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.[4]\n\nThe protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist provides obstacles and complications and creates conflicts that test the protagonist, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist's character, and having the protagonist develop as a result.\n\nThe term protagonist comes from Ancient Greek πρωταγωνιστής (prōtagōnistḗs) 'actor who plays the chief or first part', combined of πρῶτος (prôtos, 'first') and ἀγωνιστής (agōnistḗs, 'actor, competitor'), which stems from ἀγών (agṓn, 'contest') via ἀγωνίζομαι (agōnízomai, 'I contend for a prize').[5]\n\nThe earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in Ancient Greece. At first, dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. Then in Poetics, Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engaging in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C.[6] Then the poet Aeschylus, in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. Sophocles then wrote plays that included a third actor.[7][8][9][10]\n\nA description of the protagonist's origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later.[11] There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as deuteragonist and tritagonist primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part.[12] However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the deuteragonist (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the tritagonist (third most important character), the left.[12]\n\nIn Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term \"hero\", which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being in the narrative.[10]\n\nIn literary terms, a hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) protagonist is typically admired for their achievements and noble qualities.[13] Heroes are lauded for their strength, courage, virtuousness, and honor, and are considered to be the \"good guys\" of the narrative.[14]\n\nExamples include DC Comics' Superman (hero) and Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games (heroine).\n\nAn antihero (sometimes spelled as anti-hero) or antiheroine is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism, courage, and morality.\n\nExamples include Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye, Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind, Jay Gatsby from The Great Gatsby, and Walter White from Breaking Bad.\n\nA tragic hero is the protagonist of a tragedy.\n\nExamples include Oedipus from Oedipus Rex and Prince Hamlet from Shakespeare's Hamlet.\n\nThe protagonist is not always conventionally good.[15] Contrasting the hero protagonist, a villain protagonist is a protagonist who is a villain, driving the story forward regardless of the evil qualities the main character has. These traits can include being cruel, malicious, and wicked.[16]\n\nExamples include Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita[17] and Richard III in the eponymous play by William Shakespeare.[18]\n\nWhen a supporting protagonist appears, the story is told from the perspective of a character who appears to be minor. This character may be more peripheral from the events of the story and are not as involved within the \"main action\" of the plot. The supporting protagonist may be telling the story while viewing another character as the main influence of the plot.[19]\n\nOne example is Nick in The Great Gatsby.[citation needed]\n\nEuripides' play Hippolytus may be considered to have two protagonists, though one at a time. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.[20]\n\nIn Henrik Ibsen's play The Master Builder, the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.[21]\n\nIn Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.[22]\n\nIn Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist is the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).[23]\n\nSometimes, a work will have a false protagonist, who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho (1960) is an example.[24]\n\nA novel may contain a number of narratives, each with its own protagonist. Alexander Solzhenitsyn's The First Circle, for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a gulag camp.[25] Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.[26]\n\nThough many people equate protagonists with the term hero and possessing heroic qualities, it is not necessary, as even villainous characters can be protagonists. For example Michael Corleone from The Godfather (1972–1990) film series (1978–1983).\n\nIn some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in Richard Adams' novel Watership Down, a group of anthropomorphised rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.[27]Personalidad ENFJ (Protagonista): Los Protagonistas (ENFJ) se sienten llamados a servir a un propósito mayor en la vida. Reflexivos e idealistas, estos tipos de personalidad se esfuerzan por tener un impacto positivo en otras personas y en el mundo que les rodea. Rara vez rehúyen la oportunidad de hacer lo correcto, aunque no sea nada fácil.\n\nLos Protagonistas son líderes natos, lo que explica que estas personalidades se encuentren entre muchos políticos, entrenadores y profesores notables. Su pasión y carisma les permiten inspirar a los demás, no sólo en sus carreras profesionales, sino en todos los ámbitos de sus vidas, incluidas sus relaciones. Pocas cosas aportan a los Protagonistas una mayor sensación de alegría y satisfacción que guiar a sus amigos y seres queridos para que den lo mejor de sí mismos.\n\nDefender Lo Que Es Justo\n\nLos Protagonistas tienden a expresar sus valores, incluidos la autenticidad y el altruismo. Cuando algo les parece injusto o equivocado, lo denuncian. Pero rara vez dan la impresión de ser impetuosos o prepotentes, ya que su sensibilidad y perspicacia les llevan a hablar de un modo que resuena en los demás.\n\nEste tipo de personalidad tiene una asombrosa capacidad para captar las motivaciones y creencias subyacentes de las personas. A veces, ni siquiera entienden cómo llegan a captar tan rápidamente la mente y el corazón de otra persona. Estos destellos de perspicacia pueden convertir a los Protagonistas en comunicadores increíblemente persuasivos e inspiradores.\n\nCambiar la mentalidad de la gente no es tarea fácil, pero si alguien puede hacerlo, esos son los Protagonistas.\n\nEl arma secreta de los Protagonistas es su pureza de intenciones. En general, están motivados por un deseo sincero de hacer lo correcto más que por el deseo de manipular o tener poder sobre otras personas. Incluso cuando no están de acuerdo con alguien, los Protagonistas buscan puntos en común. El resultado es que las personas con este tipo de personalidad pueden comunicarse con una elocuencia y una sensibilidad que son casi imposibles de ignorar, sobre todo cuando hablan de asuntos que les llegan al corazón.\n\nCuando los Protagonistas se preocupan por alguien, quieren ayudar a resolver los problemas de esa persona, a veces a cualquier precio. La buena noticia es que muchas personas agradecen la ayuda y los consejos de los Protagonistas. Después de todo, hay una razón por la que estas personalidades tienen fama de ayudar a los demás a mejorar sus vidas.\n\nLos Protagonistas son personas auténticas y cariñosas que hablan y actúan. Nada les hace más felices que motivar a otras personas para que hagan lo correcto.\n\nPero involucrarse en los problemas de los demás no siempre es una receta para el éxito. Los Protagonistas suelen tener una visión clara de lo que la gente puede o debe hacer para mejorar, pero no todo el mundo está dispuesto a hacer esos cambios. Si los Protagonistas presionan demasiado, sus seres queridos pueden sentirse resentidos o juzgados injustamente. Y aunque este tipo de personalidad es conocida por su perspicacia, incluso los Protagonistas más sabios pueden a veces malinterpretar una situación o dar un mal consejo sin darse cuenta.\n\nLas personas con este tipo de personalidad son altruistas devotos, dispuestos a enfrentarse a hondas y flechas para defender a las personas y las ideas en las que creen. Esta fuerza de convicción refuerza las habilidades innatas de liderazgo de los Protagonistas, sobre todo su capacidad para guiar a las personas para que trabajen juntas al servicio de un bien mayor.\n\nPero su mayor don puede que sea predicar con el ejemplo. En su vida cotidiana, los Protagonistas revelan cómo situaciones aparentemente ordinarias pueden manejarse con compasión, dedicación y cuidado. Para estas personalidades, incluso las decisiones y acciones cotidianas más insignificantes -desde cómo pasan el fin de semana hasta qué le dicen a un compañero de trabajo que tiene problemas- pueden convertirse en una oportunidad para abrir el camino hacia un futuro mejor.Novella - Wikipedia: A novella is a narrative prose fiction whose length is shorter than most novels, but longer than most novelettes and short stories. The English word novella derives from the Italian novella meaning a short story related to true (or apparently so) facts.\n\nThe Italian term is a feminine of novello, which means new, similarly to the English word news.[1] Merriam-Webster defines a novella as \"a work of fiction intermediate in length and complexity between a short story and a novel\".[1] There is disagreement regarding the number of pages or words necessary for a story to be considered a novella, a short story or a novel.[2] The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association defines a novella's word count to be between 17,500 and 40,000 words;[3][4] at 250 words per page, this equates to 70 to 160 pages. See below for definitions used by other organisations.\n\nThe novella as a literary genre began developing in the Italian literature of the early Renaissance, principally by Giovanni Boccaccio, author of The Decameron (1353).[5] The Decameron featured 100 tales (named novellas) told by ten people (seven women and three men) fleeing the Black Death, by escaping from Florence to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors, notably the French queen Marguerite de Navarre, whose Heptaméron (1559) included 72 original French tales and was modeled after the structure of The Decameron.\n\nThe Italian genre novella grew out of a rich tradition of medieval short narrative forms. It took its first major form in the anonymous late 13th century Libro di novelle et di bel parlar gentile, known as Il Novellino, and reached its culmination with The Decameron. Followers of Boccaccio such as Giovanni Fiorentino, Franco Sacchetti, Giovanni Sercambi and Simone de' Prodenzani continued the tradition into the early 15th century. The Italian novella influenced many later writers, including Shakespeare.[6]\n\nNovellas were also written in Spain. Miguel de Cervantes' book Novelas ejemplares (1613) added innovation to the genre with more attention to the depiction of human character and social background.[7]\n\nNot until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a realistic mode. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the novelle (German: \"Novelle\"; plural: \"Novellen\").[7] For the German writer, a novella is a fictional narrative of indeterminate length—a few pages to hundreds—restricted to a single, suspenseful event, situation, or conflict leading to an unexpected turning point (Wendepunkt), provoking a logical but surprising end. Novellen tend to contain a concrete symbol, which is the narrative's focal point.[citation needed]\n\nThe novella influenced the development of the short story and the novel throughout Europe.[8] In the late 19th century Henry James was one of the first English language critics to use the term novella for a story that was longer and more complex than a short story, but shorter than a novel.[7]\n\nIn English speaking countries the modern novella is rarely defined as a distinct literary genre, but is often used as a term for a short novel.[9]\n\nA novella generally features fewer conflicts than a novel, yet more complex conflicts than a short story. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Novellas may or may not be divided into chapters (good examples of those with chapters are Animal Farm by George Orwell and The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells), and white space is often used to divide the sections, something less common in short stories. Novellas may be intended to be read at a single sitting, like short stories, and thus produce a unitary effect on the reader.[10] According to Warren Cariou, \"The novella is generally not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.[11]\n\nThe term novel, borrowed from the Italian novella, originally meant \"any of a number of tales or stories making up a larger work; a short narrative of this type, a fable\", and was then many times used in the plural,[12] reflecting the usage as in The Decameron and its followers. Usage of the more italianate novella in English seems to be a bit younger.[13] The differentiation of the two terms seems to have occurred only in the 19th century, following the new fashion of the novella in German literature. In 1834, John Lothrop Motley could still speak of \"Tieck's novels (which last are a set of exquisite little tales, novels in the original meaning of the word)\".[14] But when the term novella was used it was already clear that a rather short and witty form was intended: \"The brief Novella has ever been a prodigious favorite with the nation…since the days of Boccaccio.\"[15] In 1902, William Dean Howells wrote: \"Few modern fictions of the novel's dimensions…have the beauty of form many a novella embodies.\"[16]\n\nSometimes, as with other genres, the genre name is mentioned in the title of a single work (compare the Divine Comedy or Goethe's Das Märchen). Austrian writer Stefan Zweig's Die Schachnovelle (1942) (literally, \"The Chess Novella\", but translated in 1944 as The Royal Game) is an example of a title naming its genre. This might be suggestive of the genre's historicization.[citation needed]\n\nCommonly, longer novellas are referred to as novels; Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886)[17] and Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899)[18] are sometimes called novels, as are many science fiction works such as H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (1897) and Philip Francis Nowlan's Armageddon 2419 A.D. (1928). Less often, longer works are referred to as novellas. The subjectivity of the parameters of the novella genre is indicative of its shifting and diverse nature as an art form.[citation needed] In her 2010 Open Letters Monthly series, \"A Year With Short Novels\", Ingrid Norton criticizes the tendency to make clear demarcations based purely on a book's length, saying that \"any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size are bound to be misleading.\"[19]\n\nStephen King, in his introduction to Different Seasons, a 1982 collection of four novellas, notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the commercial publishing world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers.[20] Despite these problems, however, the novella's length provides unique advantages; in the introduction to a novella anthology titled Sailing to Byzantium, Robert Silverberg writes:\n\nIn his essay, \"Briefly, the case for the novella\", Canadian author George Fetherling (who wrote the novella Tales of Two Cities) said that to reduce the novella to nothing more than a short novel is like \"insisting that a pony is a baby horse\".[22]\n\nThe sometimes blurry definition between a novel and a novella can create controversy, as was the case with British writer Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach (2007). The author described it as a novella, but the panel for the Man Booker Prize in 2007 qualified the book as a \"short novel\".[23] Thus, this \"novella\" was shortlisted for an award for best original novel. A similar case is found with a much older work of fiction: The Call of the Wild (1903) by Jack London. This book, by modern standards, is short enough and straightforward enough to qualify as a novella. However, historically, it has been regarded as a novel.[citation needed]\n\nDictionaries define novelette similarly to novella, sometimes identically,[24] sometimes with a disparaging sense of being trivial or sentimental.[25] Some literary awards have a longer \"novella\" and a shorter \"novelette\" category, with a distinction based on word count. Among awards, a range between 17,500 and 40,000 words is commonly used for the novella category, whereas 7,500–17,500 is commonly used for novelettes.[26][27][28] According to The Writer, a novelette is approximately between 7,000 and 20,000 words in length, anything shorter being considered a short story.[29]\n\nThis list contains those novellas that are widely considered to be the best examples of the genre, through their appearance on multiple best-of lists.[30][31][32][33][34][35]\n\nSome literary awards include a \"best novella\" award and sometimes a separate \"best novelette\" award, separately from \"best short story\" or \"best novel\". The distinction between these categories may be entirely by word count.\n• None Fassler, Joe (24 April 2012). \"The Return of the Novella, the Original #Longread\".

A tribute to unmatched excellence.Inferno (Dante) - Wikipedia: Inferno (Italian: [iɱˈfɛrno]; Italian for 'Hell') is the first part of Italian writer Dante Alighieri's 14th-century narrative poem The Divine Comedy, followed by Purgatorio and Paradiso. The Inferno describes the journey of a fictionalised version of Dante himself through Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the \"realm [...] of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen\".[1] As an allegory, the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin.[2]\n\nThe poem begins on the night of Maundy Thursday on March 24 (or April 7), 1300, shortly before the dawn of Good Friday.[3][4] The narrator, Dante himself, is 35 years old, and thus \"midway in the journey of our life\" (Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita)[5] – half of the biblical lifespan of 70 (Psalm 89:10 in the Vulgate; numbered as Psalm 90:10 in the King James Bible). The poet finds himself lost in a dark wood (selva oscura),[6] astray from the \"straight way\" (diritta via,[7] also translatable as 'right way') of salvation. He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain, but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade: a lonza[8] (usually rendered as 'leopard' or 'leopon'),[9] a leone[10] (lion), and a lupa[11] (she-wolf). The three beasts, taken from Jeremiah 5:6,[12] are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell. According to John Ciardi, these are incontinence (the she-wolf); violence and bestiality (the lion); and fraud and malice (the leopard).[13]\n\nIt is now dawn of Good Friday, April 8, with the sun rising in Aries. The beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error, a \"lower place\" (basso loco)[14] where the sun is silent (l sol tace).[15] However, Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born sub Iulio[16] (i.e., in the time of Julius Caesar) and lived under Augustus: it is the shade of the Roman poet Virgil, author of the Aeneid, a Latin epic which also featured a journey through the underworld.\n\nOn the evening of Good Friday, Dante hesitates as he follows Virgil; Virgil explains that he has been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of Divine Love. Beatrice had been moved to aid Dante by the Virgin Mary (symbolic of compassion) and Saint Lucia (symbolic of illuminating Grace). Rachel, symbolic of the contemplative life, also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil. The two of them then begin their journey to the underworld. Feeling uncertain of his worthiness for the journey, Dante reflects on the paths of Aeneas and Paul, who were granted access to the realms of the afterlife, and doubts his own capability to undertake such a passage (Inf. 2.10-36).\n\nDante passes through the gate of Hell, which bears an inscription ending with the phrase \"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate\",[17] most frequently translated as \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here\".[nb 1] Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted. These are the souls of people who in life took no sides; the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil, but instead were merely concerned with themselves. Among these Dante recognises a figure who made the \"great refusal\", implied to be Pope Celestine V, whose \"cowardice (in selfish terror for his own welfare) served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church\".[18] Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the Rebellion of Angels. These souls are forever unclassified; they are neither in Hell nor out of it, but reside on the shores of the Acheron. Naked and futile, they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive, wavering banner (symbolic of their pursuit of ever-shifting self-interest) while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets, who continually sting them.[19] Loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners' feet drink the putrid mixture of blood, pus, and tears that flows down their bodies, symbolising the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin. This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived.\n\nAfter passing through the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who does not want to let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole (\"It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed\"),[20] referring to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until they reach the other side.\n\nVirgil proceeds to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at the centre of the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a contrapasso, a symbolic instance of poetic justice. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter fortune-tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they tried to see the future through forbidden means. Such a contrapasso \"functions not merely as a form of divine revenge, but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life\".[21] People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant.\n\nDante's Hell is structurally based on the ideas of Aristotle, but with \"certain Christian symbolisms, exceptions, and misconstructions of Aristotle's text\",[22] and a further supplement from Cicero's De Officiis.[23] Virgil reminds Dante (the character) of \"Those pages where the Ethics tells of three / Conditions contrary to Heaven's will and rule / Incontinence, vice, and brute bestiality\".[24] Cicero, for his part, had divided sins between violence and fraud.[25] By conflating Cicero's violence with Aristotle's bestiality, and his fraud with malice or vice, Dante the poet obtained three major categories of sin, as symbolized by the three beasts that Dante encounters in Canto I: these are Incontinence, Violence/Bestiality, and Fraud/Malice.[22][26] Sinners punished for incontinence (also known as wantonness) – the lustful, the gluttonous, the hoarders and wasters, and the wrathful and sullen – all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites, desires, and natural urges; according to Aristotle's Ethics, incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality, and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of Upper Hell (Circles 2–5). These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell, located within the walls of the City of Dis, for committing acts of violence and fraud – the latter of which involves, as Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason\".[26] The deeper levels are organised into one circle for violence (Circle 7) and two circles for fraud (Circles 8 and 9). As a Christian, Dante adds Circle 1 (Limbo) to Upper Hell and Circle 6 (Heresy) to Lower Hell, making 9 Circles in total; incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile, this leads to Hell containing 10 main divisions.[26] This \"9+1=10\" structure is also found within the Purgatorio and Paradiso. Lower Hell is further subdivided: Circle 7 (Violence) is divided into three rings, Circle 8 (Fraud) is divided into ten bolge, and Circle 9 (Treachery) is divided into four regions. Thus, Hell contains 24 divisions in total.\n\nDante awakens to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle contains the unbaptised and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful enough to warrant damnation, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward.\"[27] Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows, and thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism (\"the portal of the faith that you embrace\")[28] they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus (\"a Mighty One\") descend into Limbo and take Adam, Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, Rachel, and others (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the Harrowing of Hell, supposedly occurred around AD 33 or 34.\n\nDante encounters the poets Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who include him in their number and make him \"sixth in that high company\".[29] They reach the base of a great Castle – the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity – surrounded by seven gates, and a flowing brook. After passing through the seven gates, the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and Dante encounters the inhabitants of the Citadel. These include figures associated with the Trojans and their descendants (the Romans): Electra (mother of Troy's founder Dardanus), Hector, Aeneas, Julius Caesar in his role as Roman general (\"in his armor, falcon-eyed\"),[30] Camilla, Penthesilea (Queen of the Amazons), King Latinus and his daughter, Lavinia, Lucius Junius Brutus (who overthrew Tarquin to found the Roman Republic), Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia Africana. Dante also sees Saladin, a Muslim military leader known for his battle against the Crusaders, as well as his generous, chivalrous, and merciful conduct.\n\nDante next encounters a group of philosophers, including Aristotle with Socrates and Plato at his side, as well as Democritus, \"Diogenes\" (either Diogenes the Cynic or Diogenes of Apollonia), Anaxagoras, Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and \"Zeno\" (either Zeno of Elea or Zeno of Citium). He sees the scientist Dioscorides, the mythical Greek poets Orpheus and Linus, and Roman statesmen Marcus Tullius Cicero and Seneca. Dante sees the Alexandrian geometer Euclid and Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer, as well as the physicians Hippocrates and Galen. He also encounters Avicenna, a Persian polymath, and Averroes, a medieval Andalusian polymath known for his commentaries on Aristotle's works. Dante and Virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey.\n\nAlthough Dante implies that all virtuous non-Christians find themselves here, he later encounters two (Cato of Utica and Statius) in Purgatory and two (Trajan and Ripheus) in Heaven. In Purgatorio XXII, Virgil names several additional inhabitants of Limbo who were not mentioned in the Inferno.[31]\n\nDante and Virgil leave Limbo and enter the Second Circle – the first of the circles of Incontinence – where the punishments of Hell proper begin. It is described as \"a part where no thing gleams\".[32] They find their way hindered by the serpentine Minos, who judges all of those condemned for active, deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles. At this point in Inferno, every soul is required to confess all of their sins to Minos, after which Minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a number of times corresponding to the circle of Hell to which the soul must go. The role of Minos here is a combination of his classical role as condemner and unjust judge of the underworld and the role of classical Rhadamanthus, interrogator and confessor of the underworld.[33] This mandatory confession makes it so every soul verbalises and sanctions their own ranking amongst the condemned since these confessions are the sole grounds for their placement in hell.[34] Dante is not forced to make this confession; instead, Virgil rebukes Minos, and he and Dante continue on.\n\nIn the second circle of Hell are those overcome by lust. These \"carnal malefactors\"[35] are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolises the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly: \"as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried away by their passions, so now they drift for ever. The bright, voluptuous sin is now seen as it is – a howling darkness of helpless discomfort.\"[36] Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not, therefore, completely self-centred, Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper.[36][37] The \"ruined slope\"[38] in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.[39]\n\nIn this circle, Dante sees Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Paris, Achilles, Tristan, and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life. Due to the presence of so many rulers among the lustful, the fifth Canto of Inferno has been called the \"canto of the queens\".[40] Dante comes across Francesca da Rimini, who married the deformed Giovanni Malatesta (also known as \"Gianciotto\") for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother Paolo Malatesta; the two began to carry on an adulterous affair. Sometime between 1283 and 1286, Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca's bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death. Francesca explains:\n\nFrancesca further reports that she and Paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between Lancelot and Guinevere in the Old French romance Lancelot du Lac. Francesca says, \"Galeotto fu 'l libro e chi lo scrisse\".[42] The word Galeotto means 'pander', but is also the Italian term for Gallehaut, who acted as an intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere, encouraging them on to love. John Ciardi renders line 137 as \"That book, and he who wrote it, was a pander.\"[43] Inspired by Dante, author Giovanni Boccaccio invoked the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to The Decameron, a 14th-century collection of novellas. Ultimately, Francesca never makes a full confession to Dante. Rather than admit to her and Paolo's sins, the very reasons they reside in this circle of hell, she consistently takes an erroneously passive role in the adulterous affair. The English poet John Keats, in his sonnet \"On a Dream\", imagines what Dante does not write, the point of view of Paolo:\n\nAs he did at the end of Canto III, Dante – overcome by pity and anguish – describes his swoon: \"I fainted, as if I had met my death. / And then I fell as a dead body falls\".[45]\n\nIn the third circle, the gluttonous wallow in a vile, putrid slush produced by a ceaseless, foul, icy rain – \"a great storm of putrefaction\"[46] – as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite. Cerberus (described as il gran vermo, literally 'the great worm', line 22), the monstrous three-headed beast of Hell, ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire, mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs. Virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud.\n\nDorothy L. Sayers writes that \"the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary self-indulgence\".[47] The gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves, sightless and heedless of their neighbors, symbolising the cold, selfish, and empty sensuality of their lives.[47] Just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle, here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality – which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink, but also other kinds of addiction.[48]\n\nIn this circle, Dante converses with a Florentine contemporary identified as Ciacco, which means 'hog'.[49] A character with the same nickname later appears in The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio, where his gluttonous behaviour is clearly portrayed.[50] Ciacco speaks to Dante regarding strife in Florence between the \"White\" and \"Black\" Guelphs, which developed after the Guelph/Ghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the Ghibellines. In the first of several political prophecies in the Inferno, Ciacco \"predicts\" the expulsion of the White Guelphs (Dante's party) from Florence by the Black Guelphs, aided by Pope Boniface VIII, which marked the start of Dante's long exile from the city. These events occurred in 1302, prior to when the poem was written but in the future at Easter time of 1300, the time in which the poem is set.[49]\n\nThe Fourth Circle is guarded by a figure Dante names as Pluto: this is Plutus, the deity of wealth in classical mythology. Although the two are often conflated, he is a distinct figure from Pluto (Dis), the classical ruler of the underworld.[nb 2] At the start of Canto VII, he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe, but Virgil protects Dante from him.\n\nThose whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle. They include the avaricious or miserly (including many \"clergymen, and popes and cardinals\"),[51] who hoarded possessions, and the prodigal, who squandered them. The hoarders and spendthrifts joust, using great weights as weapons that they push with their chests:\n\nRelating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it (lust and gluttony), Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"Mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite; now, that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people. Indifference becomes mutual antagonism, imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering.\"[53] The contrast between these two groups leads Virgil to discourse on the nature of Fortune, who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty, as she shifts, \"those empty goods from nation unto nation, clan to clan\".[54] This speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem, since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that Virgil tells Dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them – indeed, they have lost their individuality and been rendered \"unrecognizable\".[55]\n\nIn the swampy, stinking waters of the river Styx – the Fifth Circle – the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, \"into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe\".[53] At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh, Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another; at the bottom, the sullen hatreds lie gurgling, unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them\".[53] As the last circle of Incontinence, the \"savage self-frustration\" of the Fifth Circle marks the end of \"that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion\".[53]\n\nPhlegyas reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across the Styx in his skiff. On the way they are accosted by Filippo Argenti, a Black Guelph from the prominent Adimari family. Little is known about Argenti, although Giovanni Boccaccio describes an incident in which he lost his temper; early commentators state that Argenti's brother seized some of Dante's property after his exile from Florence.[56] Just as Argenti enabled the seizing of Dante's property, he himself is \"seized\" by all the other wrathful souls.\n\nWhen Dante responds \"In weeping and in grieving, accursed spirit, may you long remain,\"[57] Virgil blesses him with words used to describe Christ himself (Luke 11:27).[58] In a literal sense, this reflects the fact that souls in Hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen, but allegorically, it reflects Dante's beginning awareness of his own sin.[59]\n\nIn the distance, Dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques. Virgil informs him that they are approaching the City of Dis. Dis, itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls.[60] Dis is one of the names of Pluto, the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. The walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter.\n\nDante is threatened by the Furies (consisting of Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone) and Medusa. An angel sent from Heaven secures entry for the poets, opening the gate by touching it with a wand, and rebukes those who opposed Dante. Allegorically, this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that philosophy and humanism cannot fully understand. Virgil also mentions to Dante how Erichtho sent him to the lowest circle of Hell to bring back a spirit from there.[59]\n\nIn the sixth circle, heretics, such as Epicurus and his followers (who say \"the soul dies with the body\")[61] are trapped in flaming tombs. Dante holds discourse with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs: Farinata degli Uberti, a famous Ghibelline leader (following the Battle of Montaperti in September 1260, Farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of Florence at the meeting of the victorious Ghibellines; he died in 1264 and was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1283); and Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, a Guelph who was the father of Dante's friend and fellow poet, Guido Cavalcanti. The political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of Florentine politics. In response to a question from Dante about the \"prophecy\" he has received, Farinata explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when \"the portal of the future has been shut\",[62] it will no longer be possible for them to know anything. Farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are Emperor Frederick II, commonly reputed to be an Epicurean, and Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, whom Dante refers to as il Cardinale.\n\nDante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to Pope Anastasius II – although some modern scholars hold that Dante erred in the verse mentioning Anastasius (\"Anastasio papa guardo, / lo qual trasse Fotin de la via dritta\", lines 8–9), confusing the pope with the Byzantine emperor of the time, Anastasius I.[63][64][65][66] Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul-smelling seventh circle, Virgil explains the geography and rationale of Lower Hell, in which the sins of violence (or bestiality) and fraud (or malice) are punished. In his explanation, Virgil refers to the Nicomachean Ethics and the Physics of Aristotle, with medieval interpretations. Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources (\"Nature\") and human labour and activity (\"Art\"). Usury, to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.[67]\n\nVirgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars' positions. The \"Wain\", the Great Bear, now lies in the northwest over Caurus (the northwest wind). The constellation Pisces (the Fish) is just appearing over the horizon: it is the zodiacal sign preceding Aries (the Ram). Canto I notes that the sun is in Aries, and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at two-hour intervals, it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise: 4:00 a.m. on Holy Saturday, April 9.[67][68]\n\nThe Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent. Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle, having first to evade the Minotaur (L'infamia di Creti, \"the infamy of Crete\", line 12); at the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, Theseus. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death (Matthew 27:51),[69] at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. Ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell (the entrance of the Second Circle, Canto V).\n\nProtected by the powers of the boiling rivulet, Dante and Virgil progress across the burning plain. They pass a roving group of Sodomites, and Dante, to his surprise, recognizes Brunetto Latini. Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection, \"paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the Inferno\",[76] thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell.[77] Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works (\"you taught me how man makes himself eternal; / and while I live, my gratitude for that / must always be apparent in my words\");[78] Brunetto prophesies Dante's bad treatment by the Florentines. He also identifies other sodomites, including Priscian, Francesco d'Accorso, and Bishop Andrea de' Mozzi.\n\nThe Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle when three shades break from their company and greet them. They are Iacopo Rusticucci, Guido Guerra, and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi – all Florentines much admired by Dante. Rusticucci blames his \"savage wife\" for his torments. The sinners ask for news of Florence, and Dante laments the current state of the city. At the top of the falls, at Virgil's order, Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge; as if in answer, a large, distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss.\n\nThe creature is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck (\"On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast\").[79] The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, Ciappo Ubriachi, the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni (who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join him here), and Giovanni di Buiamonte. Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.\n\nGeryon, the winged monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the Eighth Circle, was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies.[80] Dante's Geryon, meanwhile, is an image of fraud,[81] combining human, bestial, and reptilian elements: Geryon is a \"monster with the general shape of a wyvern but with the tail of a scorpion, hairy arms, a gaudily-marked reptilian body, and the face of a just and honest man\".[82] The pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions \"behind the face\" are all monstrous, cold-blooded, and stinging with poison.\n\nDante now finds himself in the Eighth Circle, called Malebolge (\"Evil ditches\"): the upper half of the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, concentric ditches or trenches called bolge (singular: bolgia). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like umbrella ribs or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is \"the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence – all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified\".[83]\n• 1 – Panderers and seducers: These sinners make two files, one along either bank of the ditch, and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned demons for eternity. They \"deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests, are themselves driven and scourged\". 83 Dante makes reference to a recent traffic rule developed for the Jubilee year of 1300 in Rome. 83 In the group of panderers, the poets notice Venedico Caccianemico, a Bolognese Black Guelph who sold his own sister Ghisola to the Marchese d'Este. In the group of seducers, Virgil points out Jason, the Greek hero who led the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece from Aeëtes, King of Colchis. He gained the help of the king's daughter, Medea, by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for Creusa. 83 Jason had previously seduced Hypsipyle when the Argonauts landed at Lemnos on their way to Colchis, but \"abandoned her, alone and pregnant\". 84\n• 2 – Flatterers: These also exploited other people, this time abusing and corrupting language to play upon others' desires and fears. They are steeped in excrement (representative of the false flatteries they told on earth) as they howl and fight amongst themselves. Alessio Interminei of Lucca and Thaïs are seen here. 83\n• 3 – Simoniacs: Dante now forcefully expresses his condemnation of those who committed simony, or the sale of ecclesiastic favours and offices, and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to God: \"Rapacious ones, who take the things of God, / that ought to be the brides of Righteousness, / and make them fornicate for gold and silver! / The time has come to let the trumpet sound / for you\". 85 The sinners are placed head-downwards in round, tube-like holes within the rock (debased mockeries of baptismal fonts), with flames burning the soles of their feet. The heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt. The simile of baptismal fonts gives Dante an incidental opportunity to clear his name of an accusation of malicious damage to the font at the Baptistery of San Giovanni. 86 Simon Magus, who offered gold in exchange for holy power to Saint Peter and after whom the sin is named, is mentioned here (although Dante does not encounter him). One of the sinners, Pope Nicholas III, must serve in the hellish baptism by fire from his death in 1280 until 1303 – the arrival in Hell of Pope Boniface VIII, who will take his predecessor's place in the stone tube until 1314, when he will in turn be replaced by Pope Clement V, a puppet of King Philip IV of France who moved the Holy See to Avignon, ushering in the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377). Dante delivers a denunciation of simoniacal corruption of the Church.\n• 4 – Sorcerers: In the middle of the bridge of the Fourth Bolgia, Dante looks down at the souls of fortune tellers, diviners, astrologers, and other false prophets. The punishment of those who attempted to \"usurp God's prerogative by prying into the future\", 87 is to have their heads twisted around on their bodies; in this horrible contortion of the human form, these sinners are compelled to walk backwards for eternity, blinded by their own tears. John Ciardi writes, \"Thus, those who sought to penetrate the future cannot even see in front of themselves; they attempted to move themselves forward in time, so must they go backwards through all eternity; and as the arts of sorcery are a distortion of God's law, so are their bodies distorted in Hell.\" 88 While referring primarily to attempts to see into the future by forbidden means, this also symbolises the twisted nature of magic in general. 87 Dante weeps in pity, and Virgil rebukes him, saying, \"Here pity only lives when it is dead; / for who can be more impious than he / who links God's judgment to passivity?\" 89 Virgil gives a lengthy explanation of the founding of his native city of Mantua. Among the sinners in this circle are King Amphiaraus (one of the Seven against Thebes; foreseeing his death in the war, he sought to avert it by hiding from battle but died in an earthquake caused by Zeus' thunderbolt when trying to flee) and two Theban soothsayers: Tiresias (in Ovid's Metamorphoses III, 324–331, Tiresias was transformed into a woman upon striking two coupling serpents with his rod; seven years later, he was changed back to a man in an identical encounter) and his daughter Manto. Also in this are Aruns (an Etruscan soothsayer who predicted the Caesar's victory in the Roman civil war in Lucan's Pharsalia I, 585–638), the Greek augur Eurypylus, astrologers Michael Scot (served at Frederick II's court at Palermo) and Guido Bonatti (served the court of Guido da Montefeltro), and Asdente (a shoemaker and soothsayer from Parma). Virgil implies that the moon is now setting over the Pillars of Hercules in the West: the time is just after 6:00 a.m., the dawn of Holy Saturday.\n• 5 – Barrators: Corrupt politicians, who made money by trafficking in public offices (the political analogue of the simoniacs), are immersed in a lake of boiling pitch, which represents the sticky fingers and dark secrets of their corrupt deals. 90 They are guarded by demons called the Malebranche (\"Evil Claws\"), who tear them to pieces with claws and grappling hooks if they catch them above the surface of the pitch. The Poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting Senator of Lucca and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him. Virgil secures safe-conduct from the leader of the Malebranche, named Malacoda (\"Evil Tail\"). He informs them that the bridge across the Sixth Bolgia has collapsed (as a result of the earthquake that shook Hell at the death of Christ in 34 AD) but that there is another path further on. He sends a squad of demons led by Barbariccia to escort them safely. Based on details in this Canto (and if Christ's death is taken to have occurred at exactly noon), the time is now 7:00 a.m. of Holy Saturday. 91 nb 4 The demons provide some satirical black comedy – in the last line of Canto XXI, the sign for their march is provided by a fart: \"and he had made a trumpet of his ass\". 93\n\nOne of the grafters, an unidentified Navarrese (identified by early commentators as Ciampolo), is seized by the demons, and Virgil questions him. The sinner speaks of his fellow grafters, Friar Gomita (a corrupt friar in Gallura eventually hanged by Nino Visconti – see Purgatorio VIII – for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michele Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party. Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away.\n• 6 – Hypocrites: The Poets escape the pursuing Malebranche by sliding down the sloping bank of the next pit. Here they find the hypocrites listlessly walking around a narrow track for eternity, weighted down by leaden robes. The robes are brilliantly gilded on the outside and are shaped like a monk's habit – the hypocrite's \"outward appearance shines brightly and passes for holiness, but under that show lies the terrible weight of his deceit\", 94 a falsity that weighs them down and makes spiritual progress impossible for them. 95 Dante speaks with Catalano dei Malavolti and Loderingo degli Andalò, two Bolognese brothers of the Jovial Friars, an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by Papal decree. 95 Friar Catalano points out Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel under Pontius Pilate, who counseled the Pharisees to crucify Jesus for the public good (John 11:49–50). 96 He himself is crucified to the floor of Hell by three large stakes, and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him: he \"must suffer upon his body the weight of all the world's hypocrisy\". 94 The Jovial Friars explain to Virgil how he may climb from the pit; Virgil discovers that Malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the sixth .\n• 7 – Thieves: Dante and Virgil leave the of the Hypocrites by climbing the ruined rocks of a bridge destroyed by the great earthquake, after which they cross the bridge of the seventh to the far side to observe the next chasm. The pit is filled with monstrous reptiles: the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by snakes and lizards, who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their hands behind their backs. The full horror of the thieves' punishment is revealed gradually: just as they stole other people's substance in life, their very identity becomes subject to theft here. 97 One sinner, who reluctantly identifies himself as Vanni Fucci, is bitten by a serpent at the jugular vein, bursts into flames, and is re-formed from the ashes like a phoenix. Vanni tells a dark prophecy against Dante.\n\nVanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him. The centaur Cacus arrives to punish him; he has a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. (In Roman mythology, Cacus, the monstrous, fire-breathing son of Vulcan, was killed by Hercules for raiding the hero's cattle; in Aeneid VIII, 193–267, Virgil did not describe him as a centaur). Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations. Agnello Brunelleschi, in human form, is merged with the six-legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati. A figure named Buoso (perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati, the latter of whom is mentioned in Inferno XXX.44) first appears as a man, but exchanges forms with Francesco de' Cavalcanti, who bites Buoso in the form of a four-footed serpent. Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being.\n• 8 – Counsellors of Fraud: Dante addresses a passionate lament to Florence before turning to the next . Here, fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about, hidden from view inside individual flames. These are not people who gave false advice, but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud. Ulysses and Diomedes are punished together within a great double-headed flame; they are condemned for the stratagem of the Trojan Horse (resulting in the Fall of Troy), for persuading Achilles to sail for Troy (causing Deidamia to die of grief), and for the theft of the sacred statue of Pallas, the Palladium (upon which, it was believed, the fate of Troy depended). Ulysses, the figure in the larger horn of the flame, narrates the tale of his last voyage and death, a creation of Dante's that illustrates the extent of his own pride despite his condemnation of this principal vice throughout the Divine Comedy. 98 Ulysses tells how, after his detainment by Circe, his love for neither his son, his father, nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to \"gain experience of the world / and of the vices and the worth of men\". As they approach the Pillars of Hercules, Ulysses urges his crew:\n\nDante is approached by Guido da Montefeltro, head of the Ghibellines of Romagna, asking for news of his country. Dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of Romagna. Guido then recounts his life: he advised Pope Boniface VIII to offer a false amnesty to the Colonna family, who, in 1297, had walled themselves inside the castle of Palestrina in the Lateran. When the Colonna accepted the terms and left the castle, the Pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge. Guido describes how St. Francis, founder of the Franciscan order, came to take his soul to Heaven, only to have a demon assert prior claim. Although Boniface had absolved Guido in advance for his evil advice, the demon points out the invalidity: absolution requires contrition, and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it.[100]\n• 9 – Sowers of Discord: In the ninth , the Sowers of Discord are hacked and mutilated for all eternity by a large demon wielding a bloody sword; their bodies are divided as, in life, their sin was to tear apart what God had intended to be united; 101 these are the sinners who are \"ready to rip up the whole fabric of society to gratify a sectional egotism\". 102 The souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch, their wounds healing in the course of the circuit, only to have the demon tear them apart anew. These are divided into three categories:\n• Religious schism and discord: Chief among this category is Muhammad, the founder of Islam: his body is ripped from groin to chin, with his entrails hanging out. Dante apparently saw Muhammad as causing a schism within Christianity when he and his followers splintered off. 102 103 Dante also condemns Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali, for schism between Sunni and Shiite: his face is cleft from top to bottom. Muhammad tells Dante to warn the schismatic and heretic Fra Dolcino.\n• Civil strife and political discord: In this category are Pier da Medicina (his throat slit, nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows, a wound where one of his ears had been), the Roman tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio (who advised Caesar to cross the Rubicon and thus begin the Civil War; his tongue is cut off), and Mosca dei Lamberti (who incited the Amidei family to kill Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, resulting in conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines; his arms are hacked off).\n• Family disunion, or discord between kinsmen: Finally, in the third category of sinner, Dante sees Bertran de Born (1140–1215). The knight carries his severed head by its own hair, swinging it like a lantern. Bertran is said to have caused a quarrel between Henry II of England and his son Prince Henry the Young King; his punishment in Hell is decapitation, since dividing father and son is like severing the head from the body. 102\n• 10 – Falsifiers: The final of the Eighth Circle is home to various sorts of falsifiers. A \"disease\" on society, they are themselves afflicted with different types of afflictions: 104 horrible diseases, stench, thirst, filth, darkness, and screaming. Some lie prostrate while others run hungering through the pit, tearing others to pieces. Shortly before their arrival in this pit, Virgil indicates that it is approximately noon of Holy Saturday, and he and Dante discuss one of Dante's kinsmen (Geri de Bello) among the Sowers of Discord in the previous ditch. The first category of falsifiers Dante encounters are the Alchemists (Falsifiers of Things). He speaks with two spirits viciously scrubbing and clawing at their leprous scabs: Griffolino d'Arezzo (an alchemist who extracted money from the foolish Alberto da Siena on the promise of teaching him to fly; Alberto's reputed father the Bishop of Siena had Griffolino burned at the stake) and Capocchio (burned at the stake at Siena in 1293 for practicing alchemy).\n\nSuddenly, two spirits – Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and Myrrha, both punished as Imposters (Falsifiers of Persons) – run rabid through the pit. Schicchi sinks his teeth into the neck of an alchemist, Capocchio, and drags him away like prey. Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the Counterfeiters (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine florins of 21 (rather than 24) carat gold, he was burned at the stake in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers (Falsifiers of Words). These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph in Genesis 39:7–19[105]) and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (Aeneid II, 57–194); Sinon is here rather than in Bolgia 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning fever. Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide. Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge \"began with the sale of the sexual relationship, and went on to the sale of Church and State; now, the very money is itself corrupted, every affirmation has become perjury, and every identity a lie\"[104] so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed.\n\nDante and Virgil approach the Central Well, at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolise pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery[106] – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and are visible from the Malebolge.[107] Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed had challenged the gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the poets in his palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.\n\nAt the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or \"rounds\") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of lords. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, \"The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead centre of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice.\"[108] This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers (its most famous inmate is Judas Iscariot).\n• Round 1 – Caina: this round is named after Cain, who killed his own brother in the first act of murder (Genesis 4:8). 109 This round houses the Traitors to their Kindred: they have their necks and heads out of the ice and are allowed to bow their heads, allowing some protection from the freezing wind. Here Dante sees the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, who killed each other over their inheritance and their politics some time between 1282 and 1286. Camiscion de' Pazzi, a Ghibelline who murdered his kinsman Ubertino, identifies several other sinners: Mordred (traitorous son of King Arthur); Vanni de' Cancellieri, nicknamed Focaccia (a White Guelph of Pistoia who killed his cousin, Detto de' Cancellieri); and Sassol Mascheroni of the noble Toschi family of Florence (murdered a relative). Camiscion is aware that, in July 1302, his relative Carlino de' Pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the Castle of Piantravigne to the Blacks, betraying the Whites. As a traitor to his party, Carlino belongs in Antenora, the next circle down – his greater sin will make Camiscion look virtuous by comparison. 107\n• Round 2 – Antenora: the second round is named after Antenor, a Trojan soldier who betrayed his city to the Greeks. Here lie the Traitors to their Country: those who committed treason against political entities (parties, cities, or countries) have their heads above the ice, but they cannot bend their necks. Dante accidentally kicks the head of Bocca degli Abati, a traitorous Guelph of Florence, and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met. Also punished in this level are Buoso da Duera (Ghibelline leader bribed by the French to betray Manfred, King of Naples), Tesauro dei Beccheria (a Ghibelline of Pavia; beheaded by the Florentine Guelphs for treason in 1258), Gianni de' Soldanieri (noble Florentine Ghibelline who joined with the Guelphs after Manfred's death in 1266), Ganelon (betrayed the rear guard of Charlemagne to the Muslims at Roncesvalles, according to the French epic poem The Song of Roland), and Tebaldello de' Zambrasi of Faenza (a Ghibelline who turned his city over to the Bolognese Guelphs on Nov. 13, 1280). The Poets then see two heads frozen in one hole, one gnawing the nape of the other's neck. The gnawing sinner tells his story: he is Count Ugolino, and the head he gnaws belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri. In \"the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the Inferno\", 110 Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri in 1288 to oust his nephew, Nino Visconti, and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa. However, as soon as Nino was gone, the Archbishop, sensing the Guelphs' weakened position, turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the Torre dei Gualandi. In March 1289, the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower.\n• Round 3 – Ptolomaea: the third region of Cocytus is named after Ptolemy, who invited his father-in-law Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them (1 Maccabees 16). 111 112 Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets, sealing them with small visors of crystal – even the comfort of weeping is denied to them. Dante encounters Fra Alberigo, one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza, who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes. In 1285, Alberigo invited his opponents, Manfred (his brother) and Alberghetto (Manfred's son), to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests. He explains that often a living person's soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies (\"before dark Atropos has cut their thread\"). 113 Then, on earth, a demon inhabits the body until the body's natural death. Fra Alberigo's sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d'Oria, a Genoese Ghibelline who, in 1275, invited his father-in-law, Michele Zanche (seen in the Eighth Circle, 5), and had him cut to pieces. Branca (that is, his earthly body) did not die until 1325, but his soul, together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery, fell to Ptolomaea before Zanche's soul arrived at the of the Barrators. Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo's eyes of ice (\"And yet I did not open them for him; / and it was courtesy to show him rudeness\"). 114\n• Round 4 – Judecca: the fourth division of Cocytus, named for Judas Iscariot, contains the Traitors to their Lords and benefactors. Upon entry into this round, Virgil says (\"The banners of the King of Hell draw closer\"). 115 Judecca is completely silent: all of the sinners are fully encapsulated in ice, distorted and twisted in every conceivable position. The sinners present an image of utter immobility: it is impossible to talk with any of them, so Dante and Virgil quickly move on to the centre of Hell.\n\nIn the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin (personal treachery against God), is the Devil, referred to by Virgil as Dis (the Roman god of the underworld; the name \"Dis\" was often used for Pluto in antiquity, such as in Virgil's Aeneid). The arch-traitor, Lucifer was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God, resulting in his expulsion from Heaven. Lucifer is a giant, terrifying beast trapped waist-deep in the ice, fixed and suffering. He has three faces, each a different colour: one red (the middle), one a pale yellow (the right), and one black (the left):\n\nDorothy L. Sayers notes that Satan's three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three human races: black for the African (the race of Ham), yellow for the Asiatic (the race of Shem), and red for the Europeans (the race of Japheth).[117] All interpretations recognise that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, in contrast to the all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God.[117] Lucifer retains his six wings but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world.[117] In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, \"Just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world.\"[117]\n\nAt about 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first. When they reach Satan's genitalia, the poets pass through the centre of the universe and of gravity from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water. When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb \"upward\" towards the surface of the Earth at the antipodes, Dante, in his confusion, initially believes they are returning to Hell. Virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the canonical hours of Prime (6:00 a.m.) and Terce (9:00 a.m.) — that is, 7:30 a.m. of the same Holy Saturday which was just about to end. Dante is confused as to how, after about an hour and a half of climbing, it is now apparently morning. Virgil explains that it is as a result of passing through the Earth's centre into the Southern Hemisphere, which is twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem, the central city of the Northern Hemisphere (where, therefore, it is currently 7:30 p.m.).\n\nVirgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land, but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean. Meanwhile, the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the centre of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him, forming the Mountain of Purgatory. This mountain – the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere – rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem. The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the \"space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above,\"[118] moving in opposition to Lethe, the river of oblivion, which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory. The poets finally emerge just before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday (March 27 or April 10, 1300) beneath a sky studded with stars.\n• Dante Dartmouth Project: Full text of more than 70 Italian, Latin, and English commentaries on the Commedia, ranging in date from 1322 (Iacopo Alighieri) to the 2000s (Robert Hollander)\n• World of Dante Multimedia website that offers Italian text of Divine Comedy, Allen Mandelbaum's translation, gallery, interactive maps, timeline, musical recordings, and searchable database for students and teachers by Deborah Parker and IATH (Institute for Advanced Technologies in the Humanities) of the University of Virginia\n• Dante's Divine Comedy: Full text paraphrased in modern English verse by Scottish author and artist Alasdair Gray\n• Audiobooks: Public domain recordings from LibriVox (in Italian, Longfellow translation); some additional recordings\n• A 72-piece art collection featured in Dante's Hell Animated and Inferno by Dante films\n• Danteworlds, multimedia presentation of the Divine Comedy for students by Guy Raffa of the University of Texas\n• Dante's Places: a map (still a prototype) of the places named by Dante in the Commedia, created with GoogleMaps.

The book's solution was challenging but elegant; the film clunky and predictable. \n\n\n\nPity.Inferno (2016 film) - Wikipedia: Inferno is a 2016 American action mystery thriller film directed by Ron Howard and written by David Koepp, loosely based on the 2013 novel of the same name by Dan Brown. It is the sequel to The Da Vinci Code (2006) and Angels & Demons (2009), and is the third and final film in the Robert Langdon film series. It stars Tom Hanks, reprising his role as Robert Langdon, alongside Felicity Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Omar Sy, Sidse Babett Knudsen, Ben Foster, and Irrfan Khan.\n\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy, and wrapped on July 21, 2015, in Budapest. The film premiered in Florence on October 9, 2016, and was released in the United States on October 28, 2016, ten years after the release of The Da Vinci Code.[3] The film received negative reviews from critics, and grossed $220 million against a production budget of $75 million.[4][2]\n\nSome time after helping the Holy See dealing with an antimatter threat (as depicted in Angels & Demons), Harvard University professor Robert Langdon awakens in a hospital room in Florence, Italy. He has no memory of the last few days but is plagued with hellish visions. Dr. Sienna Brooks, the doctor tending to him, reveals that he is suffering from amnesia as a result of a bullet wound to the head. An orderly says the police are there to question Langdon but the officer turns out to be Vayentha, an assassin, who shoots the orderly while coming up the hallway. Brooks helps Langdon to escape, and they flee to her apartment.\n\nAmong Langdon's personal belongings, Langdon and Brooks find a Faraday pointer, a miniature image projector with a modified version of Sandro Botticelli's Map of Hell, which itself is based on Dante's Inferno. They soon realize this is the first clue in a trail left by Bertrand Zobrist, a dangerously unstable villain who believed that rigorous measures were necessary to reduce the Earth's growing population, and who committed suicide three days earlier after being chased by armed government agents.\n\nLangdon and Brooks figure out that Zobrist, who was obsessed with Dante, has created a biological superweapon he has dubbed \"Inferno\", with the potential of annihilating half the world's population. In the meantime, they have been traced by both Vayentha and government agents, who try to raid the apartment, forcing them to flee again. The government agents are headed by Elizabeth Sinskey, an old lover of Langdon's. Vayentha reports to her employer Harry Sims, the CEO of a private security company called \"The Consortium\", who is acting on behalf of Zobrist, who gives her instructions to kill Langdon as he had become a liability.\n\nLangdon's knowledge of Dante's work and history, and of hidden passages in Florence, allows the two to follow clues such as letters and phrases which lead to various locations in Florence and Venice, while inadvertently killing Vayentha and evading the agents. Along the way, Langdon discovers that he helped a friend of his steal and hide the Dante death mask, a crucial clue, an event that he also does not remember. Zobrist had provided Sims with a video message about the attack, to be broadcast after it has been released. Shocked by its content, Sims allies with Sinskey to prevent the outbreak. However, Langdon and Brooks are contacted by Christoph Bouchard, a man working with Sinskey, warning them that Sinskey is a double agent and is after the Inferno for her own profit. The three cooperate for a while, until Langdon realizes that Bouchard is lying and seeking to profit from Inferno himself, forcing the duo to flee on their own again.\n\nLangdon figures out that the attack is in the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul. With that knowledge, Brooks abandons Langdon, revealing that she was Zobrist's lover and that she will ensure the release of the weapon. Zobrist and Brooks used to play treasure hunt games; this trail was the backup plan in case something happened to Zobrist. Langdon is recaptured by Bouchard but Sims kills Bouchard and rescues Langdon, who then re-teams with Sinskey, who asked him for help in interpreting the imagery from the Faraday pointer. Sims reveals he was hired by Brooks to kidnap Langdon when Zobrist had been killed, and drugged with benzodiazepine to induce a memory loss; the events in the hospital were all staged.\n\nThey deduce the weapon is in a plastic bag hidden underwater in the Basilica Cistern in Istanbul. The agents team – joined by Langdon, Sims, and Sinskey – race to locate and secure the bag, while Brooks and fellow Zobrist disciples attempt to detonate an explosive to rupture the bag and aerosolize the weapon. Sims incapacitates a disciple and kills another but is fatally stabbed by Brooks who, refusing Langdon's pleas, releases the weapon by manually triggering an underwater blast. The detonation ruptures the bag, which however has been trapped by Sinskey in a special containment unit. After struggling against Sinskey and Langdon to open the container, Brooks' last ally is killed by special units. The weapon is secured for analysis, while Langdon and Sinskey ruminate on the idealism of youth and the future of humanity. Langdon returns to Florence and covertly returns the Dante death mask.\n• Tom Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology at Harvard University. 5\n• Omar Sy as Christophe Bouchard, head of the SRS team (Surveillance and Response Support), of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. 6\n• Ben Foster as Bertrand Zobrist, a billionaire and transhumanist scientist, intent on solving the world's overpopulation problem. 7 8\n• Sidse Babett Knudsen as Dr. Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the World Health Organization. 6\n• Irrfan Khan as Harry \"The Provost\" Sims, head of The Consortium, helping Zobrist in his mission. 6\n• Ana Ularu as Vayentha, The Consortium's agent in Florence who has orders to follow Langdon. 8\n\nOn July 16, 2013, Columbia Pictures set Ron Howard to direct Dan Brown's fourth novel in the Robert Langdon series, Inferno, with David Koepp writing the script. Imagine Entertainment was set to produce the film, while Tom Hanks was again set to reprise his role as Robert Langdon. On August 26, 2014, Sony had finalized the deal with Howard and Hanks, and set the film for April start of production in Italy.[5] Brian Grazer was also set to produce the film with Howard.[5]\n\nOn December 2, Felicity Jones was in early talks to join the film.[10] On February 17, 2015, studio revealed the confirmed cast for the film, including Jones as Dr. Sienna Brooks, Omar Sy as Christoph Bruder, Irrfan Khan as Harry \"The Provost\" Sims, and Sidse Babett Knudsen as Elizabeth Sinskey, head of the World Health Organization.[6] Ben Foster was set for an unspecified villainous role on March 10, 2015, which later revealed to be the role of Bertrand Zobrist.[7]\n\nFilming began on April 27, 2015, in Venice, Italy,[11] and continued in Florence, Italy, starting at the end of April. Outdoor scenes featuring Hanks were filmed near the Palazzo Vecchio and elsewhere in the historic center of the city, starting on May 2, 2015. Some second unit stunts were filmed by Wade Eastwood at an apartment building close to the Ponte Vecchio, in Florence. Low-flying aerial shots of Florence landmarks, its river and bridges were filmed on May 11, 2015.[12] A sequence displayed in an early trailer features a Padova railway station sign; locals of Padova immediately recognized the scene as recreated somewhere else.[13] As of June 5, 2015, most of the film was planned to be shot in Budapest, Hungary, at Korda Studios.[14] Filming wrapped on July 21, 2015.[15]\n\nDuring location filming, its production codename was \"Headache\", a reference to a concussion suffered by Langdon early in the story.[12][16]\n\nThe score was composed by Hans Zimmer and recorded at Synchron Stage Vienna in Austria.[17]\n\nIn July 2013, Sony set the film for a release on December 18, 2015. However, due to the date clash with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the release date was moved to October 14, 2016.[19] In early 2016, the release date was pushed back two more weeks to October 28, 2016.[20]\n\nOn May 9, 2016, Sony Pictures released the first teaser trailer for the film.[21] The film premiered in Florence, Italy on October 8, 2016, at the New Opera Theater[22] and also held a premiere in India on October 13, 2016, due to the popularity of actor Irrfan Khan.[23]\n\nInferno grossed $34.3 million in the United States and Canada and $185.7 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $220 million, against a production budget of $75 million.[2]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, Inferno was initially expected to top the box office with around $25 million from 3,546 theaters in its opening weekend.[24][25] It made $800,000 from Thursday night previews and $5.6 million on its first day, lowering weekend projections to $15 million. It ended up opening to $14.9 million, finishing second at the box office behind Boo! A Madea Halloween and marked the fourth straight domestic disappointment for director Ron Howard.[26]\n\nInternationally, the film was released two weeks ahead of its North American debut, across 53 overseas markets (about 66% of its total international market) in order to avoid competition from Disney/Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange. It finished at first place at the box office in 45 of those countries. In total, it opened to $49.7 million, of which $2.6 million came from IMAX theaters, the second biggest amount of October.[27][28] It fell 49% in its second weekend, earning $28.9 million from 58 markets and was surpassed by Jack Reacher: Never Go Back at the chart.[29] Italy, where the film was partly shot, delivered the biggest opening with $5 million. This was followed by Germany ($4.4 million), where it competed for No. 1 with the animated Finding Dory. Russia similarly opened to $4.4 million, followed by the United Kingdom and Ireland ($3.8 million), Spain ($2 million) and the Netherlands ($1.2 million).[27] Inferno's £2.97 million debut in the U.K. is considerably less than the first (£9.50 million) and the second film (£6.05 million).[30] In Latin America, the film debuted in first in all 11 markets, earning a combined $9 million. Brazil led with $4 million, followed by Mexico ($2.6 million).[27] Similarly in South East Asia, it saw top openings in six out of seven markets for a combined $6 million. Japan ($3.3 million), Taiwan ($1.7 million), India ($1.9 million) and Indonesia ($1 million) posted the biggest debuts.[27] In China, it opened at number one with $13.3 million.[31] In the Oceania region, Australia launched with $1.8 million. Inferno opened to number one across the Middle East for a regional total of $1.8 million.[27] The film opened in France on November 9 and grossed $24.3 million on its opening weekend.[32]\n\nInferno received generally negative reviews from critics.[33] On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, the film has an approval rating of 23% based on 253 reviews; the average rating is 4.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Senselessly frantic and altogether shallow, Inferno sends the Robert Langdon trilogy spiraling to a convoluted new low.\"[34] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 42 out of 100 based on 47 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[35] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[36]\n\nBritish film critic Mark Kermode gave the film a negative review, calling it, \"intergalactically stupid\".[37] Cinema Blend wrote Inferno is \"insufferable. And while you're obviously meant to take Inferno with a dash of salt, it's so preposterously stupid and dumb that this rancid popcorn flick becomes increasingly nauseating the further you taste.\"[38]\n• Dante Alighieri and the Divine Comedy in popular cultureDan Brown: Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels, including The Da Vinci Code, which has become one of the best selling novels of all time as well as the subject of intellectual debate among readers and scholars. Brown’s novels are published in 56 languages around the world with over 200 million copies in print.\n\nIn 2005, Brown was named one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by TIME Magazine, whose editors credited him with “keeping the publishing industry afloat; renewed interest in Leonardo da Vinci and early Christian history; spiking tourism to Paris and Rome; a growing membership in secret societies; the ire of Cardinals in Rome; eight books denying the claims of the novel and seven guides to read along with it; a flood of historical thrillers; and a major motion picture franchise.”\n\nThe son of a mathematics teacher and a church organist, Brown was raised on a prep school campus where he developed a fascination with the paradoxical interplay between science and religion. These themes eventually formed the backdrop for his books. He is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy, where he later returned to teach English before focusing his attention full time to writing. He lives in New England with his yellow lab, Winston.\n\nBrown’s latest novel, Origin, explores two of the fundamental questions of humankind: Where do we come from? Where are we going?Dan Brown - Wikipedia: Daniel Gerhard Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author best known for his thriller novels, including the Robert Langdon novels Angels & Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009), Inferno (2013), and Origin (2017). His novels are treasure hunts that usually take place over a period of 24 hours.[3] They feature recurring themes of cryptography, art, and conspiracy theories. His books have been translated into 57 languages and, as of 2012, have sold over 200 million copies. Three of them, Angels & Demons, The Da Vinci Code, and Inferno, have been adapted into films, while one of them, The Lost Symbol, was adapted into a television series.\n\nThe Robert Langdon novels are deeply engaged with Christian themes and historical fiction, and have generated controversy as a result. Brown states on his website that his books are not anti-Christian and he is on a \"constant spiritual journey\" himself.[4] He states that his book The Da Vinci Code is \"an entertaining story that promotes spiritual discussion and debate\" and suggests that the book may be used \"as a positive catalyst for introspection and exploration of our faith.\"[5]\n\nDaniel Gerhard Brown was born on June 22, 1964, in Exeter, New Hampshire.[6] He has a younger sister, Valerie (born 1968) and brother, Gregory (born 1974). Brown attended Exeter's public schools until the ninth grade.[7] He grew up on the campus of Phillips Exeter Academy, where his father, Richard G. Brown, was a teacher of mathematics and wrote textbooks[8] from 1968 until his retirement in 1997.[9] His mother, Constance (née Gerhard), descended from Pennsylvania Dutch Schwenkfelders,[10] and trained as a church organist and student of sacred music.[7] Brown was raised an Episcopalian,[8] and described his religious evolution in a 2009 interview:\n\nWhen asked in the same interview about his then-current religious views, Brown replied:\n\nBrown's interest in secrets and puzzles stems from their presence in his household as a child, where codes and ciphers were the linchpin tying together the mathematics, music, and languages in which his parents worked. The young Brown spent hours working out anagrams and crossword puzzles, and he and his siblings participated in elaborate treasure hunts devised by their father on birthdays and holidays. On Christmas, for example, Brown and his siblings did not find gifts under the tree, but followed a treasure map with codes and clues throughout their house and even around town to find the gifts.[11] Brown's relationship with his father inspired that of Sophie Neveu and Jacques Saunière in The Da Vinci Code, and Chapter 23 of that novel was inspired by one of his childhood treasure hunts.[12]\n\nAfter graduating from Phillips Exeter, Brown attended Amherst College where he double majored in English and Spanish. At Amherst, he was initiated into the Psi Upsilon fraternity. He played squash, sang in the Amherst Glee Club, and was a writing student of visiting novelist Alan Lelchuk. Brown spent the 1985 school year in Seville, Spain, where he was enrolled in an art history course at the University of Seville.[11] Brown graduated from Amherst in 1986.[13][14]\n\nAfter graduating from Amherst, Brown dabbled with a musical career, creating effects with a synthesizer, and self-producing a children's cassette entitled SynthAnimals, which included a collection of tracks such as \"Happy Frogs\" and \"Suzuki Elephants\"; it sold a few hundred copies. He then formed his own record company called Dalliance, and in 1990 self-published a CD entitled Perspective, targeted to the adult market, which also sold a few hundred copies. In 1991 he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as singer-songwriter and pianist. To support himself, he taught classes at Beverly Hills Preparatory School.[15][16]\n\nBrown joined the National Academy of Songwriters and participated in many of its events. It was there that he met his wife, Blythe Newlon, who was the academy's Director of Artist Development. Though it was not officially part of her job, she took on the seemingly unusual task of helping to promote Brown's projects; she wrote press releases, set up promotional events, and put him in contact with people who could be helpful to his career. She and Brown also developed a personal relationship, though this was not known to all of their associates until 1993, when Brown moved back to New Hampshire, and it was learned that Newlon would accompany him. They married in 1997, at Pea Porridge Pond, near Conway, New Hampshire.[17] In 1994, Brown released a CD titled Angels & Demons. Its artwork was the same ambigram by artist John Langdon which he later used for the novel Angels & Demons. The liner notes also again credited his wife for her involvement, thanking her \"for being my tireless cowriter, coproducer, second engineer, significant other, and therapist\".[17] The CD included songs such as \"Here in These Fields\" and the religious ballad, \"All I Believe\".[18]\n\nBrown and his wife Blythe moved to Rye, New Hampshire, in 1993.[17] Brown became an English teacher at his alma mater Phillips Exeter, and gave Spanish classes to 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at Lincoln Akerman School, a small school for K–8th grade with about 250 students, in Hampton Falls.[19] Brown has written a symphonic work titled Wild Symphony which is supplemented by a book of the same name.[20] The book is illustrated by Hungarian artist Susan Batori[21] which feature simple ambigrams for children, while the visuals trigger the corresponding music in an accompanying app.[22] The music was recorded by the Zagreb Festival Orchestra[23] and will receive its world concert premiere by the Portsmouth Symphony Orchestra in 2020.[24] On March 30, 2022, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Weed Road Pictures will turn Wild Symphony into an animated musical feature film in the vein of Walt Disney's Fantasia, with Brown writing the screenplay and songs, and Akiva Goldsman producing.[25]\n\nWhile on vacation in Tahiti in 1993,[11] Brown read Sidney Sheldon's novel The Doomsday Conspiracy, and was inspired to become a writer of thrillers.[11][26][27] He started work on Digital Fortress, setting much of it in Seville, where he had studied in 1985. He also co-wrote a humor book with his wife, 187 Men to Avoid: A Survival Guide for the Romantically Frustrated Woman, under the pseudonym \"Danielle Brown\".[28] The book's author profile reads, \"Danielle Brown currently lives in New England: teaching school, writing books, and avoiding men.\" The copyright to the book is attributed to Brown.[29]\n\nIn 1996, Brown quit teaching to become a full-time writer. Digital Fortress was published in 1998. His wife Blythe did much of the book's promotion, writing press releases, booking Brown on talk shows, and setting up press interviews. A few months later, Brown and his wife released The Bald Book, another humor book. It was officially credited to his wife, though a representative of the publisher said that it was primarily written by Brown. Brown subsequently wrote Angels & Demons and Deception Point, released in 2000 and 2001 respectively, the former of which was the first to feature the lead character, Harvard symbology expert Robert Langdon.[30]\n\nBrown's first three novels had little success, with fewer than 10,000 copies in each of their first printings. His fourth novel, The Da Vinci Code, became a bestseller, going to the top of the New York Times Best Seller list during its first week of release in 2003. It is one of the most popular books of all time, with 81 million copies sold worldwide as of 2009.[31][32] Its success has helped push sales of Brown's earlier books. In 2004, all four of his novels were on the New York Times list in the same week,[33] and in 2005 he made Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Influential People of the Year. Forbes magazine placed Brown at No. 12 on their 2005 \"Celebrity 100\" list, and estimated his annual income at US$76.5 million. According to the article published in The Times, the estimated income of Brown after Da Vinci Code sales is $250 million.[34]\n\nBrown's third novel featuring Robert Langdon, The Lost Symbol, was released on September 15, 2009.[35] According to the publisher, on its first day the book sold over one million in hardcover and e-book versions in the US, the UK and Canada, prompting the printing of 600,000 hardcover copies in addition to the five million first printing.[36] The story takes place in Washington D.C. over a period of twelve hours, and features the Freemasons. The book also includes many elements that made The Da Vinci Code a number one best seller. Brown's promotional website states that puzzles hidden in the book jacket of The Da Vinci Code, including two references to the Kryptos sculpture at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, give hints about the sequel. Brown has adopted a relevant theme in some of his earlier work.[37]\n\nBrown's fourth novel featuring Robert Langdon, Inferno is a mystery thriller novel released on May 14, 2013, by Doubleday.[38] It ranked No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list for the first 11 weeks of its release, has sold more than 1.4 million copies in the US alone.[39] In a 2006 interview, Brown stated that he had ideas for about 12 future books featuring Robert Langdon.[40] Characters in Brown's books are often named after real people in his life. Robert Langdon is named after John Langdon, the artist who created the ambigrams used for the Angels & Demons CD and novel. Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca is named after On a Claire Day cartoonist friend Carla Ventresca. In the Vatican archives, Langdon recalls a wedding of two people named Dick and Connie, which are the names of his parents. Robert Langdon's editor Jonas Faukman is named after Brown's real life editor Jason Kaufman. Brown also said that characters were based on a New Hampshire librarian, and a French teacher at Exeter, André Vernet. Cardinal Aldo Baggia, in Angels & Demons, is named after Aldo Baggia, instructor of modern languages at Phillips Exeter Academy.[41]\n\nIn interviews, Brown has said his wife, Blythe, is an art historian and painter. When they met, she was the Director of Artistic Development at the National Academy for Songwriters in Los Angeles. During the 2006 lawsuit over alleged copyright infringement in The Da Vinci Code, information was introduced at trial that showed that Blythe did research for the book.[42] In one article, she was described as \"chief researcher\".[43] Doubleday published his seventh book, Origin, on October 3, 2017. It is the fifth book in his Robert Langdon series.[44]\n\nBrown's prose style has been criticized as clumsy,[45][46] with The Da Vinci Code being described as \"committing style and word choice blunders in almost every paragraph\".[47] In his 2005 documentary for Channel 4, The Real Da Vinci Code, author and presenter Tony Robinson criticised both the accuracy of the author's historic research and the writing itself, considering the book to be not particularly well written. Much of the criticism was centered on Brown's claim in his preface that the novel is based on fact in relation to Opus Dei and the Priory of Sion, and that \"all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents and secret rituals in [the] novel are accurate\".[48][49]\n\nIn addition to Sidney Sheldon, Brown has been quite vocal about a number of other literary influences who have inspired his writing. Recurring elements that Brown prefers to incorporate into his novels include a simple hero pulled out of their familiar setting and thrust into a new one with which they are unfamiliar, an attractive female sidekick/ love interest, foreign travel, imminent danger from a pursuing villain, antagonists who have a disability or genetic disorder, and a 24-hour time frame in which the story takes place.[3]\n\nBrown's work is heavily influenced by academic Joseph Campbell, who wrote extensively on mythology and religion and was highly influential in the field of screenwriting. Brown also states he based the character of Robert Langdon on Campbell.[50] Director Alfred Hitchcock appears to be another key influence on Brown. Like Hitchcock, the writer favors suspense-laden plots involving an innocent middle-aged man pursued by deadly foes, glamorous foreign settings, key scenes set in tourist destinations, a cast of wealthy and eccentric characters, young and curvaceous female sidekicks, Catholicism and MacGuffins. Brown does his writing in his loft. He told fans that he uses inversion therapy to help with writer's block. He uses gravity boots and says, \"hanging upside down seems to help me solve plot challenges by shifting my entire perspective\".[51]\n\nIn August 2005 author Lewis Perdue unsuccessfully sued Brown for plagiarism, on the basis of claimed similarity between The Da Vinci Code and his novels, The Da Vinci Legacy (1983) and Daughter of God (2000). Judge George B. Daniels said, in part: \"A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude that The Da Vinci Code is substantially similar to Daughter of God.\"[52] In April 2006 Brown's publisher, Random House, won a copyright infringement case brought by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, who claimed that Brown stole ideas from their 1982 book Holy Blood Holy Grail for his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code. It was in the book Holy Blood Holy Grail that Baigent, Leigh, and co-author Henry Lincoln had advanced the theory that Jesus and Mary Magdalene married and had a child and that the bloodline continues to this day. Brown apparently alluded to the two authors' names in his book. Leigh Teabing, a lead character in both the novel and the film, uses Leigh's name as the first name, and anagrammatically derives his last name from Baigent's. Mr Justice Peter Smith found in Brown's favor in the case, and as a private amusement, embedded his own Smithy code in the written judgment.[53]\n\nOn March 28, 2007, Brown's publisher, Random House, won an appeal copyright infringement case. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the efforts from Baigent and Leigh, who became liable for paying legal expenses of nearly US$6 million.[54] Brown has been sued twice in U.S. federal courts by the author Jack Dunn, who claims Brown copied a huge part of his book The Vatican Boys to write The Da Vinci Code (2006–07) and Angels & Demons (2011–12). Both lawsuits were not allowed to go to a jury trial and Jack Dunn claims the judge in both cases benefited from his decisions by becoming an author published and supported by people associated with Random House, Dan Brown's publisher. In 2017, in London, another claim was begun against Brown by Jack Dunn who claimed that justice was not served in the U.S. lawsuits.[55]\n\nIn October 2004, Brown and his siblings donated US$2.2 million to Phillips Exeter Academy in honor of their father, to set up the Richard G. Brown Technology Endowment to help \"provide computers and high-tech equipment for students in need\".[56] On April 14, 2011, Dan and his wife, Blythe Newlon Brown, created an eponymous scholarship fund to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his graduation from Amherst College. It is a permanently endowed scholarship fund that provides financial aid to students at Amherst, with preference given to incoming students with an interest in writing.[14] On June 16, 2016, Brown donated US$337,000 to the Ritman Library in Amsterdam to digitize a collection of ancient books.[57]\n\nBrown and his wife, Blythe Newlon, were supporters of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation.[58][17] In 2019, after 21 years of marriage, Brown and his wife acrimoniously divorced, with the financial settlement still to be concluded due to Brown's alleged infidelities during the latter part of their marriage.[59] In December 2021, the couple agreed to settle the lawsuit.[60]\n\nIn 2006, Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code was released as a film by Columbia Pictures, with director Ron Howard. It was widely anticipated and launched the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, though it received overall poor reviews. It currently has a 26% rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, derived from 165 negative reviews of the 214 counted.[62] It was later listed as one of the worst films of 2006 on Ebert & Roeper,[63] but also the second highest-grossing film of the year, pulling in US$750 million worldwide.[64]\n\nBrown was listed as one of the executive producers of the film The Da Vinci Code, and also created additional codes for the film. One of his songs, \"Phiano\", which Brown wrote and performed, was listed as part of the film's soundtrack. In the film, Brown and his wife can be seen in the background of one of the early book signing scenes.[65] The next film, Angels & Demons, was released on May 15, 2009, with Howard and Hanks returning. It, too, garnered mostly negative reviews, though critics were kinder to it than to its predecessor; it has a 37% meta-rating at Rotten Tomatoes.[66]\n\nFilmmakers expressed interest in adapting The Lost Symbol into a film as well.[67][68] The screenplay was written by Danny Strong, with pre-production expected to begin in 2013.[69] According to a January 2013 article in Los Angeles Times the final draft of the screenplay was due sometime in February.[69] In July 2013, Sony Pictures announced they would instead adapt Inferno for a release date of October 14, 2016,[70] with Ron Howard as director, David Koepp adapting the screenplay and Tom Hanks reprising his role as Robert Langdon. Inferno was released on October 28, 2016.[71]\n\nImagine Entertainment was announced in 2014 to produce a television series based on Digital Fortress, written by Josh Goldin and Rachel Abramowitz.[72] In 2021, Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol was adapted into a television series repositioned as an origin story for Brown's Robert Langdon character with Ashley Zukerman playing Langdon.[73] It ran on the streaming service Peacock for one season.[74]"}

(medio siglo antes que Kamala Harris)Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (Monrovia, 29 de octubre de 1938) es una economista y política liberiana. Fue la 24.ª presidenta de Liberia, tras vencer en las elecciones presidenciales del 8 de noviembre de 2005, cuando derrotó al otro principal candidato, el exfutbolista George Weah. Tomó posesión de su cargo el 16 de enero de 2006, siendo la primera mujer presidente electa en África,[2]​ cargo que ocupó hasta 2018.\n\nSirvió como ministra de Hacienda bajo el mandato del presidente William Tolbert, desde 1972 hasta 1973, cuando un golpe de Estado derrocó a Tolbert, después de lo cual dejó Liberia y ocupó altos cargos en diversas instituciones financieras. Obtuvo un distante segundo lugar en las elecciones presidenciales de 1997. El 7 de octubre de 2011 recibió el Premio Nobel de la Paz, compartido con su compatriota Leymah Gbowee y con la yemení Tawakel Karman.\n\nPor parte de su padre es de la etnia gola (1/2) y por parte de su madre de la etnia kru (1/4) y alemana (1/4).\n\nEl padre de Johnson-Sirleaf, Jahmale Carney Johnson, nació en la pobreza de las zonas rurales. Fue el hijo de un jefe Gola de nombre Jenneh, en Julijuah, del condado de Bomi. Su padre fue enviado a Monrovia, donde su apellido fue cambiado a Johnson por la lealtad de su padre al Presidente Hilary R. W. Johnson, el primer presidente que nació en Liberia. El padre de Johnson-Sirleaf se convirtió en el primer liberiano proveniente de un grupo de una etnia indígena en ocupar un cargo de la legislación nacional.\n\nSu madre también nació en la pobreza en Greenville. Su abuela Juah Sarwee envió a la madre de Johnson-Sirleaf a Monrovia cuando el abuelo alemán de Johnson-Sirleaf tuvo que huir del país después que Monrovia le declarara la guerra a Alemania durante la Primera Guerra Mundial. Una miembro de una prominente familia estadounidense-liberiana, Cecilia Dunbar, adoptó y crio a la madre de Johnson-Sirleaf.\n\nAunque no sea américo-liberiana por descendencia, Johnson-Sirleaf se considera culturalmente estadounidense-liberiana.\n\nJohnson-Sirleaf estudió economía y cuentas de 1948 a 1955 en el Colegio de África Occidental en Monrovia. Ella se casó con James Sirleaf cuando tenía diecisiete años de edad, y viajó a América en 1961 para continuar sus estudios en la Universidad de Colorado, donde finalmente obtuvo un grado. Johnson-Sirleaf empezó a estudiar economía en Harvard de 1969 a 1971, ganando un Máster en Administración Pública. A continuación, regresó a su país para trabajar bajo el gobierno de William Tolbert. Sirleaf tuvo cuatro hijos y tiene ocho nietos. Además, su sobrino Emmanuel Sumana Elsar fue su consejero político durante las elecciones presidenciales del 2005 en contra de George Weah.\n\nElla sirvió como ministra de Hacienda de 1972 a 1973 bajo el gobierno de Tolbert. Renunció después de entrar en un desacuerdo sobre gastos. Unos años más tarde, el sargento Samuel Doe, uno de los miembros del grupo étnico indígena krahn, tomó el poder en un golpe militar y el presidente William Tolbert fue ejecutado junto con varios miembros de su gabinete por un pelotón de fusilamiento. La Redención del Pueblo tomó el control del país y encabezó una purga contra el ex gobierno. Johnson-Sirleaf logró escapar en sentido estricto y se exilió en Kenia. De 1983 a 1985 se desempeñó como directora del Banco Citibank en Nairobi. Cuando Samuel Doe se declaró a sí mismo presidente de Liberia, decidió regresar a su país de origen a participar en las elecciones y volverse en contra de Doe. Fue puesta bajo arresto domiciliario por el hecho, y fue condenada a 10 años de prisión. Johnson-Sirleaf estuvo un tiempo mucho más corto por tomar la oferta de volver una vez más al exilio.\n\nSe trasladó a Washington, y sirvió como vicepresidente de la Oficina Regional para el Banco Citibank, en Nairobi, y del Banco del Ecuador, en Washington. De 1992 a 1997 trabajó como asistente de administrador y, a continuación, directora del Desarrollo de las Naciones Unidas del Programa de la Oficina Regional para África. Volvió a Liberia durante los disturbios civiles y se conmovió cuando Samuel Doe fue asesinado por un grupo escindido de Charles Taylor del Frente Patriótico Nacional de Liberia. Inicialmente, ella apoyó a Taylor en la sangrienta rebelión contra el presidente Samuel Doe en 1990, que más tarde pasó a oponerse a él. Un gobierno provisional fue puesto en el poder, liderado por una sucesión. En 1997, ella se postuló para las elecciones presidenciales de 1997, donde obtuvo el segundo lugar en una polémica elección, perdiendo ante Charles Taylor consiguiendo un 10% de los votos ante el 75% de Taylor. Muchos observadores dijeron que la elección fue justa, aunque pronto Johnson-Sirleaf fue acusada de traición.\n\nEn 1999 la Guerra Civil regresó a la región y Taylor fue acusado de interferir con sus vecinos, fomentando los disturbios y la rebelión. El 11 de agosto de 2003, después de mucha persuasión, Charles Taylor entregó el poder a su suplente Moses Blah. El nuevo gobierno provisional y los grupos rebeldes firmaron un histórico acuerdo de paz y establecieron la instalación de un nuevo jefe de Estado. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf se propuso como una posible candidata, pero al final los diversos grupos seleccionaron a Gyude Bryant, un político neutral. Johnson-Sirleaf se desempeñó como jefe de la Comisión para la Reforma de la gobernanza. Johnson-Sirleaf desempeñó un papel activo en el gobierno de transición como el país preparándose para las elecciones de 2005, y, finalmente, postuló para la presidencia en contra de su rival, el exfutbolista internacional, George Weah. Johnson-Sirleaf obtuvo una mayoría en la elección a través de la disputa de Weah en los resultados. El anuncio de la nueva líder se aplazó hasta las investigaciones que se llevaron a cabo.\n\nEn la primera vuelta de las elecciones, su candidatura fue la segunda más votada con 175.520 votos, pasando a la segunda vuelta definitiva en la que se enfrentó a George Weah. El 11 de noviembre de 2005, con un escrutinio del 97% de los votos, la Comisión Electoral Nacional de Liberia declaró a Johnson-Sirleaf ganadora de las elecciones, resultado no aceptado por su oponente George Weah, que presentó un recurso ante el Tribunal Supremo liberiano pidiendo que se suspendiera el escrutinio por supuestas irregularidades. Las acusaciones de fraude fueron rechazadas por los observadores internacionales y por la comisión electoral, que el 23 de noviembre confirmó el triunfo de Johnson-Sirleaf.\n\nEl 23 de noviembre de 2005, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf fue declarada la ganadora de las elecciones en Liberia y se confirmó como la próxima presidenta del país. Su inauguración, a la que asistieron numerosos dignatarios extranjeros, incluida la primera dama de EE. UU. Laura Bush y la secretaria de Estado Condoleezza Rice, tuvo lugar el lunes 16 de enero de 2006.\n\nEn marzo de 2012 se vio envuelta en una fuerte polémica por unas declaraciones en las que defendía la criminalización de la homosexualidad[3]​ en su país en un momento en el que se debatían dos proyectos para endurecer las penas. A causa de ello, el ex primer ministro británico Tony Blair, presente en el acto en el cual Johnson-Sirleaf pronunció esas declaraciones, declaró sentirse avergonzado[4]​ y organizaciones defensoras de los derechos de los homosexuales han comenzado una campaña para que el Premio Nobel le sea retirado.[5]​\n\nEn diciembre de 2021, James Sirleaf, uno de los hijos de Ellen Sirleaf, murió en su residencia de Liberia en circunstancias desconocidas.[6]​[7]​\n\nDurante la campaña electoral, la figura de la abuela fue a menudo eclipsada por parte de los funcionarios y guardaespaldas. Un veterano de la escena política de Liberia le dijo a la señora Johnson-Sirleaf que su apodo proviene de su voluntad de hierro y determinación.\n\n\"Hubiera sido mucho más fácil para ella dejar la política y sentarse en casa, otros lo han hecho pero ella nunca ha renunciado\".\n\nEn la primera ronda de votación de 2005, llegó en segundo lugar con 175.520 votos, a través de su puesta a la segunda vuelta de votación el 8 de noviembre contra el exjugador de fútbol George Weah. El 11 de noviembre, la Comisión Electoral Nacional de Liberia declaró a Johnson-Sirleaf la presidenta electa de Liberia. Su inauguración de su cargo tuvo lugar el 16 de enero del 2006; algunos extranjeros que asistieron a la ceremonia fueron Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush y Michaëlle Jean.\n\nEl 15 de marzo del 2006, la presidenta Johnson-Sirleaf pidió una reunión conjunta del Congreso de los Estados Unidos, pidiendo el apoyo de América para ayudar a su país a \"convertirse en un brillante faro, un ejemplo para África y el mundo de lo que el amor por la libertad puede lograr\".\n\nIncómodamente para Johnson-Sirleaf, los seguidores del expresidente Taylor siguen siendo en gran número en el gobierno de Liberia. La distanciada esposa de Taylor, Jewel Howard Taylor, se encuentra en el Senado.\n\nEl 26 de julio de 2007, la presidenta Johnson-Sirleaf, celebra el Día aniversario 160 de la Independencia de Liberia bajo el lema \"En Liberia 160: Reclamemos el futuro\". Ella le pidió al activista de 25 años de edad, Kimmie Weeks, servir como orador nacional para las celebraciones. Kimmie se convirtió en el orador nacional más joven de Liberia en más de un centenar de años y pronunció un discurso de gran alcance. Pidió que el gobierno le dé prioridad a la educación y a la atención de la salud. Unos días más tarde, la presidenta Sirleaf emitió una orden ejecutiva en la que la educación primaria fue declarada gratuita y obligatoria para todos los niños en edad escolar.\n\nLa presidenta Johnson-Sirleaf es una miembro del Consejo de Mujeres Líderes Mundiales, una red internacional de actuales y exmujeres presidentas y primeras ministras, cuya misión es movilizar el mayor nivel de mujeres dirigentes a nivel mundial para la acción colectiva sobre cuestiones de importancia como un desarrollo equitativo.\n\nEn 2011 fue reconocida con el Premio Nobel de la paz junto a la activista Leymah Gbowee del movimiento Mujeres de Liberia Acción Masiva para la Paz y la periodista, activista y política yemení Tawakel Karman.[8]​\n\nEn el legado de Sirleaf destaca haber logrado una década de paz en Liberia y organizar una transición pacífica tras perder las elecciones en 2017 en segunda vuelta. Sin embargo también ha sido acusada de nepotismo a causa del nombramiento de su hijo Charles Sirleaf como vicegobernador del Banco Central de Liberia o la posición de su otro hijo Robert como presidente de la Compañía Nacional de Petróleo de Liberia –NOCAL-.[9]​\n\nHa recibido críticas por los pocos avances durante su mandato en relación con los derechos de las mujeres y las políticas de igualdad de género. La activista Leymah Gbowee que compartió con Sirleaf el premio Nobel en 2011 señaló \"Si bien rompió el techo de cristal, y hay que reconocerlo, sus políticas no han cambiado problemáticas fundamentales de género” y reprochando las declaraciones de Sirleaf en las que tildaba el feminismo de extremismo.[10]​[9]​\n\nEn 2012 fue criticada por organizaciones de derechos humanos por defender una ley que criminaliza las relaciones homosexuales en Liberia[11]​ señalando en unas declaraciones al periódico The Guardian \"Tenemos ciertos valores tradicionales en nuestra sociedad que nos gustaría conservar\".[12]​[13]​\n• Artículos en Wikinoticias: Toma posesión la primera mujer jefe de estado de un país africano\n• Un artículo sobre Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf por el Museo internacional de mujeres.\n• None Liberia: Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf será la primera mujer jefe de Estado en África enlace roto disponible en Internet Archive ; véase el historial , la primera versión y la última ).

One of the two Marxist–Leninist states in Southeast Asia,[i] Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nVietnam was inhabited by the Paleolithic age, with states established in the first millennium BC on the Red River Delta in modern-day northern Vietnam. The Han dynasty annexed Northern and Central Vietnam, which were subsequently under Chinese rule from 111 BC until the first dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences through Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta, conquering Champa. During most of the 17th and 18th centuries, Vietnam was effectively divided into two domains of Đàng Trong and Đàng Ngoài. The Nguyễn—the last imperial dynasty—surrendered to France in 1883. In 1887, its territory was integrated into French Indochina as three separate regions. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the nationalist coalition Viet Minh, led by the communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, launched the August Revolution and declared Vietnam's independence from the Empire of Japan in 1945.\n\nVietnam went through prolonged warfare in the 20th century. After World War II, France returned to reclaim colonial power in the First Indochina War, from which Vietnam emerged victorious in 1954. As a result of the treaties signed between the Viet Minh and France, Vietnam was also separated into two parts. The Vietnam War began shortly after, between the communist North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union and China, and the anti-communist South Vietnam, supported by the United States. Upon the North Vietnamese victory in 1975, Vietnam reunified as a unitary socialist state under the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in 1976. An ineffective planned economy, a trade embargo by the West, and wars with Cambodia and China crippled the country further. In 1986, the CPV initiated economic and political reforms similar to the Chinese economic reform, transforming the country to a socialist-oriented market economy. The reforms facilitated Vietnamese reintegration into the global economy and politics.\n\nVietnam is a developing country with a lower-middle-income economy. It has high levels of corruption, censorship, environmental issues and a poor human rights record. It is part of international and intergovernmental institutions including the ASEAN, the APEC, the CPTPP, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OIF, and the WTO. It has assumed a seat on the United Nations Security Council twice.\n\nThe name Việt Nam (pronounced [viə̂tˀ nāːm], chữ Hán: 越南), literally \"Viet South\", means \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order or \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order.[15] A variation of the name, Nanyue (or Nam Việt, 南越), was first documented in the 2nd century BC. The term \"Việt\" (Yue) (Chinese: 越; pinyin: Yuè; Cantonese Yale: Yuht; Wade–Giles: Yüeh4; Vietnamese: Việt) in Early Middle Chinese was first written using the logograph \"戉\" for an axe (a homophone), in oracle bone and bronze inscriptions of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1200 BC), and later as \"越\". At that time, it referred to a people or chieftain to the northwest of the Shang. In the early 8th century BC, a tribe on the middle Yangtze were called the Yangyue, a term later used for peoples further south.\n\nBetween the 7th and 4th centuries BC, 'Yue'/'Việt' referred to the State of Yue in the lower Yangtze basin and its people. From the 3rd century BC, the term was used for the non-Chinese populations of southern China and northern Vietnam, with particular ethnic groups called Minyue, Ouyue, Luoyue (Vietnamese: Lạc Việt), etc., collectively called the Baiyue (Bách Việt, Chinese: 百越; pinyin: Bǎiyuè; Cantonese Yale: Baak Yuet; Vietnamese: Bách Việt; lit. 'Hundred Yue/Viet').\n\nThe term 'Baiyue'/'Bách Việt' first appeared in the book Lüshi Chunqiu compiled around 239 BC. By the 17th and 18th centuries AD, educated Vietnamese apparently referred to themselves as người Việt (Viet people) or người Nam (southern people).\n\nThe form Việt Nam ( 越南) is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem Sấm Trạng Trình. The name has also been found on 12 steles carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in Hải Phòng that dates to 1558. In 1802, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (who later became Emperor Gia Long) established the Nguyễn dynasty. In the second year of his rule, he asked the Jiaqing Emperor of the Qing dynasty to confer on him the title 'King of Nam Việt / Nanyue' (南越 in Chinese character) after seizing power in Annam. The Emperor refused because the name was related to Zhao Tuo's Nanyue, which included the regions of Guangxi and Guangdong in southern China. The Qing Emperor, therefore, decided to call the area \"Việt Nam\" instead,[j] meaning \"South of the Viet\" per Classical Chinese word order but the Vietnamese understood it as \"Viet of the South\" per Vietnamese word order.[15] Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.[j] It was revived in the early 20th century in Phan Bội Châu's History of the Loss of Vietnam, and later by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDĐ). The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when the imperial government in Huế adopted Việt Nam.\n\nArchaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the Paleolithic age. Stone artefacts excavated in Gia Lai province have been claimed to date to 780,000 years ago,[27] based on associated find of tektites, however this claim has been challenged because tektites are often found in archaeological sites of various ages in Vietnam.[28] Homo erectus fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in Lạng Sơn and Nghệ An provinces in northern Vietnam. The oldest Homo sapiens fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of Middle Pleistocene provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum. Teeth attributed to Homo sapiens from the Late Pleistocene have been found at Dong Can, and from the Early Holocene at Mai Da Dieu, Lang Gao and Lang Cuom. Areas comprising what is now Vietnam participated in the Maritime Jade Road, as ascertained by archeological research.[39][40][41][42]\n\nBy about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-rice cultivation in the Ma River and Red River floodplains led to the flourishing of Đông Sơn culture, notable for its bronze casting used to make elaborate bronze Đông Sơn drums. At this point, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of Văn Lang and Âu Lạc appeared, and the culture's influence spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Maritime Southeast Asia, throughout the first millennium BC.\n\nAccording to Vietnamese legends, Hồng Bàng dynasty of the Hùng kings first established in 2879 BC is considered the first state in the history of Vietnam (then known as Xích Quỷ and later Văn Lang). In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán. He consolidated the Lạc Việt and Âu Việt tribes to form the Âu Lạc, proclaiming himself An Dương Vương. In 179 BC, a Chinese general named Zhao Tuo (\"Triệu Đà\") defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into Nanyue. However, Nanyue was itself incorporated into the empire of the Chinese Han dynasty in 111 BC after the Han–Nanyue War. For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under Chinese rule. Early independence movements, such as those of the Trưng Sisters and Lady Triệu, were temporarily successful, though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the Anterior Lý dynasty between AD 544 and 602.[verification needed] By the early 10th century, Northern Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the Khúc family.\n\nIn AD 938, the Vietnamese lord Ngô Quyền defeated the forces of the Chinese Southern Han state at Bạch Đằng River and achieved full independence for Vietnam in 939 after a millennium of Chinese domination. By the 960s, the dynastic Đại Việt (Great Viet) kingdom was established, Vietnamese society enjoyed a golden era under the Lý and Trần dynasties. During the rule of the Trần dynasty, Đại Việt repelled three Mongol invasions. Meanwhile, the Mahāyāna branch of Buddhism flourished and became the state religion. Following the 1406–7 Ming–Hồ War, which overthrew the Hồ dynasty, Vietnamese independence was interrupted briefly by the Chinese Ming dynasty, but was restored by Lê Lợi, the founder of the Lê dynasty. The Vietnamese polity reached their zenith in the Lê dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of emperor Lê Thánh Tông (1460–1497). Between the 11th and 18th centuries, the Vietnamese polity expanded southward in a gradual process known as Nam tiến (\"Southward expansion\"), eventually conquering the kingdom of Champa and part of the Khmer Kingdom.\n\nFrom the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of Đại Việt. First, the Chinese-supported Mạc dynasty challenged the Lê dynasty's power. After the Mạc dynasty was defeated, the Lê dynasty was nominally reinstalled. Actual power, however, was divided between the northern Trịnh lords and the southern Nguyễn lords, who engaged in a civil war for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s. Vietnam was divided into North (Trịnh) and South (Nguyễn) from 1600 to 1777. During this period, the Nguyễn expanded southern Vietnam into the Mekong Delta, annexing the Central Highlands and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta. The division of the country ended a century later when the Tây Sơn brothers helped Trịnh to end Nguyễn, they also established new dynasty and ended Trịnh. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguyễn lords, led by Nguyễn Ánh. Nguyễn Ánh unified Vietnam, and established the Nguyễn dynasty, ruling under the name Gia Long.\n\nIn the 1500s, the Portuguese explored the Vietnamese coast and reportedly erected a stele on the Chàm Islands to mark their presence. By 1533, they began landing in the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave because of local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than they did in China and Japan. After they had settled in Macau and Nagasaki to begin the profitable Macau–Japan trade route, the Portuguese began to involve themselves in trade with Hội An. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries under the Padroado system were active in both Vietnamese realms of Đàng Trong (Cochinchina or Quinan) and Đàng Ngoài (Tonkin) in the 17th century. The Dutch also tried to establish contact with Quinan in 1601 but failed to sustain a presence there after several violent encounters with the locals. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with Tonkin in the spring of 1637 after leaving Dejima in Japan to establish trade for silk. Meanwhile, in 1613, the first English attempt to establish contact with Hội An failed following a violent incident involving the East India Company. By 1672 the English did establish relations with Tonkin and were allowed to reside in Phố Hiến.\n\nBetween 1615 and 1753, French traders also engaged in trade in Vietnam. The first French missionaries arrived in 1658, under the Portuguese Padroado. From its foundation, the Paris Foreign Missions Society under Propaganda Fide actively sent missionaries to Vietnam, entering Cochinchina first in 1664 and Tonkin first in 1666. Spanish Dominicans joined the Tonkin mission in 1676, and Franciscans were in Cochinchina from 1719 to 1834. The Vietnamese authorities began[when?] to feel threatened by continuous Christianisation activities. After several Catholic missionaries were detained, the French Navy intervened in 1843 to free them, as the kingdom was perceived as xenophobic. In a series of conquests from 1859 to 1885, France eroded Vietnam's sovereignty. At the siege of Tourane in 1858, France was aided by Spain (with Filipino, Latin American, and Spanish troops from the Philippines)[88] and perhaps some Tonkinese Catholics. After the 1862 Treaty, and especially after France completely conquered Lower Cochinchina in 1867, the Văn Thân movement of scholar-gentry class arose and committed violence against Catholics across central and northern Vietnam.\n\nBetween 1862 and 1867, the southern third of the country became the French colony of Cochinchina. By 1884, the entire country was under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated into the two protectorates of Annam and Tonkin. The three entities were formally integrated into the union of French Indochina in 1887. The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society. A Western-style system of modern education introduced new humanist values. Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in Saigon, and in Hanoi, the colony's capital.\n\nDuring the colonial period, guerrillas of the royalist Cần Vương movement rebelled against French rule and massacred around a third of Vietnam's Christian population. After a decade of resistance, they were defeated in the 1890s by the Catholics in reprisal for their earlier massacres. Another large-scale rebellion, the Thái Nguyên uprising, was also suppressed heavily. The French developed a plantation economy to promote export of tobacco, indigo, tea and coffee. However, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and self-government. An increasing dissatisfaction, even led to half-hearted, badly co-ordinated, and still worsely executed plots to oust the French, like the infamous Hanoi Poison Plot of 1908.\n\nA nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders like Phan Bội Châu, Phan Châu Trinh, Phan Đình Phùng, Emperor Hàm Nghi, and Hồ Chí Minh fighting or calling for independence. This resulted in the 1930 Yên Bái mutiny by the Vietnamese Nationalist Party (VNQDĐ), which the French quashed. The mutiny split the independence movement, as many leading members converted to communism.\n\nThe French maintained full control of their colonies until World War II, when the war in the Pacific led to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in 1940. Afterwards, the Japanese Empire was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while the pro-Vichy French colonial administration continued. Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a full-scale takeover of the country in March 1945. This led to the Vietnamese Famine of 1945 which killed up to two million people.\n\nIn 1941, the Việt Minh, a nationalist liberation movement based on a communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader Hồ Chí Minh. The Việt Minh sought independence for Vietnam from France and the end of the Japanese occupation. After the military defeat of Japan in World War II and the fall of its puppet government Empire of Vietnam in August 1945, Saigon's administrative services collapsed and chaos, riots, and murder were widespread. The Việt Minh occupied Hanoi and proclaimed a provisional government, which asserted national independence on 2 September.\n\nIn July 1945, the Allies had decided to divide Indochina at the 16th parallel to allow Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China to receive the Japanese surrender in the north while Britain's Lord Louis Mountbatten received their surrender in the south. The Allies agreed that Indochina still belonged to France.\n\nBut as the French were weakened by the German occupation, British-Indian forces and the remaining Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group were used to maintain order and help France reestablish control through the 1945–1946 War in Vietnam. Hồ initially chose to take a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with France, asking the French to withdraw their colonial administrators and for French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam. But the Provisional Government of the French Republic did not act on these requests, including the idea of independence, and dispatched the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to restore colonial rule. This resulted in the Việt Minh launching a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946. The resulting First Indochina War lasted until July 1954. The defeat of French colonialists and Vietnamese loyalists in the 1954 battle of Điện Biên Phủ allowed Hồ to negotiate a ceasefire from a favourable position at the subsequent Geneva Conference.\n\nThe colonial administration was thereby ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 21 July 1954 into three countries—Vietnam, and the kingdoms of Cambodia and Laos. Vietnam was further divided into North and South administrative regions at the Demilitarised Zone, roughly along the 17th parallel north (pending elections scheduled for July 1956[k]). A 300-day period of free movement was permitted, during which almost a million northerners, mainly Catholics, moved south, fearing persecution by the communists. This migration was in large part aided by the United States military through Operation Passage to Freedom. The partition of Vietnam by the Geneva Accords was not intended to be permanent, and stipulated that Vietnam would be reunited after the elections. But in 1955, the southern State of Vietnam's prime minister, Ngô Đình Diệm, toppled Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum organised by his brother Ngô Đình Nhu, and proclaimed himself president of the Republic of Vietnam. This effectively replaced the internationally recognised State of Vietnam by the Republic of Vietnam in the south—supported by the United States, France, Laos, Republic of China and Thailand—and Hồ's Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, supported by the Soviet Union, Sweden,[126] Khmer Rouge, and the People's Republic of China.\n\nFrom 1953 to 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted agrarian reforms including \"rent reduction\" and \"land reform\", which resulted in significant political repression. This included 13,500 to as many as 100,000 executions. In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in \"political reeducation centres\". This programme incarcerated many non-communists, but was successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time. The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 people were killed in the process by November 1957. The pro-Hanoi Việt Cộng began a guerrilla campaign in South Vietnam in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government. From 1960, the Soviet Union and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.\n\nIn 1963, Buddhist discontent with Diệm's Catholic regime erupted into mass demonstrations, leading to a violent government crackdown. This led to the collapse of Diệm's relationship with the United States, and ultimately to a 1963 coup in which he and Nhu were assassinated. The Diệm era was followed by more than a dozen successive military governments, before the pairing of Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and General Nguyễn Văn Thiệu took control in mid-1965. Thiệu gradually outmaneuvered Kỳ and cemented his grip on power in fraudulent elections in 1967 and 1971. During this political instability, the communists began to gain ground. To support South Vietnam's struggle against the communist insurgency, the United States used the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident as a pretext for increasing its contribution of military advisers. US forces became involved in ground combat operations by 1965, and at their peak several years later, numbered more than 500,000. The US also engaged in sustained aerial bombing. Meanwhile, China and the Soviet Union provided North Vietnam with significant material aid and 15,000 combat advisers. Communist forces supplying the Việt Cộng carried supplies along the Hồ Chí Minh trail, which passed through Laos.\n\nThe communists attacked South Vietnamese targets during the 1968 Tết Offensive. The campaign failed militarily, but shocked the American establishment and turned US public opinion against the war. During the offensive, communist troops massacred over 3,000 civilians at Huế. Facing an increasing casualty count, rising domestic opposition to the war, and growing international condemnation, the US began withdrawing from ground combat roles in the early 1970s. This also entailed an unsuccessful effort to strengthen and stabilise South Vietnam. Following the Paris Peace Accords of 27 January 1973, all American combat troops were withdrawn by 29 March 1973. In December 1974, North Vietnam captured the province of Phước Long and started a full-scale offensive, culminating in the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. South Vietnam was ruled by a provisional government for almost eight years while under North Vietnamese military occupation.\n\nOn 2 July 1976, North and South Vietnam were merged to form the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The war had devastated Vietnam and killed 966,000 to 3.8 million people. A 1974 US Senate subcommittee estimated nearly 1.4 million Vietnamese civilians were killed or wounded between 1965 and 1974—including 415,000 killed.[159] In its aftermath, under Lê Duẩn's administration, there were no mass executions of South Vietnamese who had collaborated with the US or the defunct South Vietnamese government, confounding Western fears, but up to 300,000 South Vietnamese were sent to reeducation camps, where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labour. The government embarked on a mass campaign of collectivisation of farms and factories. Many fled the country following the conclusion of the war. In 1978, in response to the Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia ordering massacres of Vietnamese residents in the border villages in the districts of An Giang and Kiên Giang, the Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia and removed them from power after occupying Phnom Penh. The intervention was a success, resulting in the establishment of a new, pro-Vietnam socialist government, the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which ruled until 1989. However, this worsened relations with China, which had supported the Khmer Rouge. China later launched a brief incursion into northern Vietnam in 1979, causing Vietnam to rely even more heavily on Soviet economic and military aid, while mistrust of the Chinese government escalated.\n\nAt the Sixth National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) in December 1986, reformist politicians replaced the \"old guard\" government with new leadership. The reformers were led by 71-year-old Nguyễn Văn Linh, who became the party's new general secretary. He and the reformers implemented a series of free-market reforms known as Đổi Mới (\"Renovation\") that carefully managed the transition from a planned economy to a \"socialist-oriented market economy\". Although the authority of the state remained unchallenged under Đổi Mới, the government encouraged private ownership of farms and factories, economic deregulation, and foreign investment, while maintaining control over strategic industries. Subsequently, Vietnam's economy achieved strong growth in agricultural and industrial production, construction, exports, and foreign investment, although these reforms also resulted in a rise in income inequality and gender disparities.\n\nIn 2021, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, Nguyen Phu Trong, was re-elected for his third term in office, meaning he was Vietnam's most powerful leader in decades.[176] He died 19 July 2024, and was followed by To Lam as General Secretary of the Communist Party.\n\nVietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese Peninsula between the latitudes 8° and 24°N, and the longitudes 102° and 110°E. It covers a total area of 331,210 km2 (127,881 sq mi)[8] or 331,699 km2 (128,070 sq mi).[9] The combined length of the country's land boundaries is 4,639 km (2,883 mi), and its coastline is 3,444 km (2,140 mi) long. At its narrowest point in the central Quảng Bình province, the country is as little as 50 kilometres (31 mi) across, though it widens to around 600 kilometres (370 mi) in the north. Vietnam's land is mostly hilly and densely forested, with level land covering no more than 20%. Mountains account for 40% of the country's land area, and tropical forests cover around 42%. The Red River Delta in the north, a flat, roughly triangular region covering 15,000 km2 (5,792 sq mi), is smaller but more intensely developed and more densely populated than the Mekong River Delta in the south. Once an inlet of the Gulf of Tonkin, it has been filled in over the millennia by riverine alluvial deposits. The delta, covering about 40,000 km2 (15,444 sq mi), is a low-level plain no more than 3 metres (9.8 ft) above sea level at any point. It is criss-crossed by a maze of rivers and canals, which carry so much sediment that the delta advances 60 to 80 metres (196.9 to 262.5 ft) into the sea every year. The exclusive economic zone of Vietnam covers 417,663 km2 (161,261 sq mi) in the South China Sea.\n\nSouthern Vietnam is divided into coastal lowlands, the mountains of the Annamite Range, and extensive forests. Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land. The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation. Several minor earthquakes have been recorded. The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high. From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest. The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.\n\nDue to differences in latitude and the marked variety in topographical relief, Vietnam's climate tends to vary considerably for each region. During the winter or dry season, extending roughly from November to April, the monsoon winds usually blow from the northeast along the Chinese coast and across the Gulf of Tonkin, picking up considerable moisture. The average annual temperature is generally higher in the plains than in the mountains, especially in southern Vietnam compared to the north. Temperatures vary less in the southern plains around Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta, ranging from between 21 and 35 °C (70 and 95 °F) over the year. In Hanoi and the surrounding areas of the Red River Delta, the temperatures are much lower between 15 and 33 °C (59 and 91 °F). Seasonal variations in the mountains, plateaus, and the northernmost areas are much more dramatic, with temperatures varying from 3 °C (37 °F) in December and January to 37 °C (99 °F) in July and August. During winter, snow occasionally falls over the highest peaks of the far northern mountains near the Chinese border.[200] Vietnam receives high rates of precipitation in the form of rainfall with an average amount from 1,500 to 2,000 mm (60 to 80 in) during the monsoon seasons; this often causes flooding, especially in the cities with poor drainage systems. The country is also affected by tropical depressions, tropical storms and typhoons. Vietnam is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with 55% of its population living in low-elevation coastal areas.[203]\n\nAs the country is located within the Indomalayan realm, Vietnam is one of twenty-five countries considered to possess a uniquely high level of biodiversity. This was noted in the country's National Environmental Condition Report in 2005. It is ranked 16th worldwide in biological diversity, being home to approximately 16% of the world's species. 15,986 species of flora have been identified in the country, of which 10% are endemic. Vietnam's fauna includes 307 nematode species, 200 oligochaeta, 145 acarina, 113 springtails, 7,750 insects, 260 reptiles, and 120 amphibians. There are 840 birds and 310 mammals are found in Vietnam, of which 100 birds and 78 mammals are endemic. Vietnam has two World Natural Heritage Sites—the Hạ Long Bay and Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park—together with nine biosphere reserves, including Cần Giờ Mangrove Forest, Cát Tiên, Cát Bà, Kiên Giang, the Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, Western Nghệ An, Cà Mau, and Cu Lao Cham Marine Park.\n\nVietnam is also home to 1,438 species of freshwater microalgae, constituting 9.6% of all microalgae species, as well as 794 aquatic invertebrates and 2,458 species of sea fish. In recent years, 13 genera, 222 species, and 30 taxa of flora have been newly described in Vietnam. Six new mammal species, including the saola, giant muntjac and Tonkin snub-nosed monkey have also been discovered, along with one new bird species, the endangered Edwards's pheasant. In the late 1980s, a small population of Javan rhinoceros was found in Cát Tiên National Park. However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010. In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species. The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.\n\nIn Vietnam, wildlife poaching has become a major concern. In 2000, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) called Education for Nature – Vietnam was founded to instill in the population the importance of wildlife conservation in the country. In the years that followed, another NGO called GreenViet was formed by Vietnamese youngsters for the enforcement of wildlife protection. Through collaboration between the NGOs and local authorities, many local poaching syndicates were crippled by their leaders' arrests. A study released in 2018 revealed Vietnam is a destination for the illegal export of rhinoceros horns from South Africa due to the demand for them as a medicine and a status symbol.\n\nThe main environmental concern that persists in Vietnam today is the legacy of the use of the chemical herbicide Agent Orange, which continues to cause birth defects and many health problems in the Vietnamese population. In the southern and central areas affected most by the chemical's use during the Vietnam War, nearly 4.8 million Vietnamese people have been exposed to it and suffered from its effects. In 2012, approximately 50 years after the war, the US began a US$43 million joint clean-up project in the former chemical storage areas in Vietnam to take place in stages. Following the completion of the first phase in Đà Nẵng in late 2017, the US announced its commitment to clean other sites, especially in the heavily impacted site of Biên Hòa.\n\nThe Vietnamese government spends over VNĐ10 trillion each year ($431.1 million) for monthly allowances and the physical rehabilitation of victims of the chemicals. In 2018, the Japanese engineering group Shimizu Corporation, working with Vietnamese military, built a plant for the treatment of soil polluted by Agent Orange. Plant construction costs were funded by the company itself. One of the long-term plans to restore southern Vietnam's damaged ecosystems is through the use of reforestation efforts. The Vietnamese government began doing this at the end of the war. It started by replanting mangrove forests in the Mekong Delta regions and in Cần Giờ outside Hồ Chí Minh City, where mangroves are important to ease (though not eliminate) flood conditions during monsoon seasons. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.35/10, ranking it 104th globally out of 172 countries.[224]\n\nApart from herbicide problems, arsenic in the ground water in the Mekong and Red River Deltas has also become a major concern. And most notoriously, unexploded ordnances (UXO) pose dangers to humans and wildlife—another bitter legacy from the long wars. As part of the continuous campaign to demine/remove UXOs, several international bomb removal agencies from the United Kingdom, Denmark, South Korea and the US have been providing assistance. The Vietnam government spends over VNĐ1 trillion ($44 million) annually on demining operations and additional hundreds of billions of đồng for treatment, assistance, rehabilitation, vocational training and resettlement of the victims of UXOs.\n\nVietnam is a unitary Marxist-Leninist one-party socialist republic, one of the two communist states (the other being Laos) in Southeast Asia. Although Vietnam remains officially committed to socialism as its defining creed, its economic policies have grown increasingly capitalist, with The Economist characterising its leadership as \"ardently capitalist communists\". Under the constitution, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) asserts their role in all branches of the country's politics and society. The president is the elected head of state and the commander-in-chief of the military, serving as the chairman of the Council of Supreme Defence and Security, and holds the second highest office in Vietnam as well as performing executive functions and state appointments and setting policy.\n\nThe general secretary of the CPV performs numerous key administrative functions, controlling the party's national organisation. The prime minister is the head of government, presiding over a council of ministers composed of five deputy prime ministers and the heads of 26 ministries and commissions. Only political organisations affiliated with or endorsed by the CPV are permitted to contest elections in Vietnam. These include the Vietnamese Fatherland Front and worker and trade unionist parties.\n\nThe National Assembly of Vietnam is the unicameral state legislature composed of 500 members. Headed by a chairman, it is superior to both the executive and judicial branches, with all government ministers being appointed from members of the National Assembly. The Supreme People's Court of Vietnam, headed by a chief justice, is the country's highest court of appeal, though it is also answerable to the National Assembly. Beneath the Supreme People's Court stand the provincial municipal courts and many local courts. Military courts possess special jurisdiction in matters of state security. Vietnam maintains the death penalty for numerous offences.\n\nIn 2023, a three-person collective leadership was responsible for governing Vietnam. President Võ Văn Thưởng,[239] Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính (since 2021)[240] and the most powerful leader Nguyễn Phú Trọng (since 2011) as the Communist Party of Vietnam's General Secretary.[241] On 22 May 2024, Tô Lâm, who previously served as the Minister of Public Security, was voted as the president of Vietnam by the National Assembly after Võ Văn Thưởng resigned on the same year due to corruption charges against him.[242] On 3 August 2024, Tô Lâm, who is also serving as the president, was elected by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam as the general secretary following the death of Nguyễn Phú Trọng on 19 July 2024.[243][244] On 21 October 2024, the National Assembly appointed army general Lương Cường as president, succeeding Tô Lâm.[245]\n\nVietnam is divided into 57 provinces (Vietnamese: Tỉnh, chữ Hán: 省). There are also six municipalities (thành phố trực thuộc trung ương), which are administratively on the same level as provinces.\n\nProvinces are subdivided into provincial municipalities (thành phố trực thuộc tỉnh, 'city under province'), townships (thị xã) and counties (huyện), which are in turn subdivided into towns (thị trấn) or communes (xã).\n\nCentrally controlled municipalities are subdivided into districts (quận) and counties, which are further subdivided into wards (phường).\n\nThroughout its history, Vietnam's main foreign relationship has been with various Chinese dynasties. Following the partition of Vietnam in 1954, North Vietnam maintained relations with the Eastern Bloc, South Vietnam maintained relations with the Western Bloc. Despite these differences, Vietnam's sovereign principles and insistence on cultural independence have been laid down in numerous documents over the centuries before its independence. These include the 11th-century patriotic poem \"Nam quốc sơn hà\" and the 1428 proclamation of independence \"Bình Ngô đại cáo\". Though China and Vietnam are now formally at peace, significant territorial tensions remain between the two countries over the South China Sea. Vietnam holds membership in 63 international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie), and World Trade Organization (WTO). It also maintains relations with over 650 non-governmental organisations. As of 2010 Vietnam had established diplomatic relations with 178 countries.\n\nVietnam's current foreign policy is to consistently implement a policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, co-operation, and development, as well openness, diversification, multilateralisation with international relations. The country declares itself a friend and partner of all countries in the international community, regardless of their political affiliation, by actively taking part in international and regional cooperative development projects. Since the 1990s, Vietnam has taken several key steps to restore diplomatic ties with capitalist Western countries. It already had relations with communist Western countries in the decades prior. Relations with the United States began improving in August 1995 with both states upgrading their liaison offices to embassy status. As diplomatic ties between the two governments grew, the United States opened a consulate general in Ho Chi Minh City while Vietnam opened its consulate in San Francisco. Full diplomatic relations were also restored with New Zealand, which opened its embassy in Hanoi in 1995; Vietnam established an embassy in Wellington in 2003. President of the United States, Bill Clinton, made a historic visit to Vietnam in November 2000. He was the first U.S. leader ever to officially visit Hanoi and the first to visit Vietnam since U.S. troops withdrew from the country in 1975.[257] Pakistan also reopened its embassy in Hanoi in October 2000, with Vietnam reopening its embassy in Islamabad in December 2005 and trade office in Karachi in November 2005. In May 2016, US President Barack Obama further normalised relations with Vietnam after he announced the lifting of an arms embargo on sales of lethal arms to Vietnam. Despite their historical past, today Vietnam is considered to be a potential ally of the United States, especially in the geopolitical context of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea and in containment of Chinese expansionism.\n\nThe Vietnam People's Armed Forces consists of the Vietnam People's Army (VPA), the Vietnam People's Public Security and the Vietnam Self-Defence Militia. The VPA is the official name for the active military services of Vietnam, and is subdivided into the Vietnam People's Ground Forces, the Vietnam People's Navy, the Vietnam People's Air Force, the Vietnam Border Guard and the Vietnam Coast Guard. The VPA has an active manpower of around 450,000, but its total strength, including paramilitary forces, may be as high as 5,000,000. In 2015, Vietnam's military expenditure totalled approximately US$4.4 billion, equivalent to around 8% of its total government spending. Joint military exercises and war games have been held with Brunei, India, Japan, Laos, Russia, Singapore and the US. In 2017, Vietnam signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\n\nThe government of Vietnam, reduced from a totalitarian system to an authoritarian one, carries many legacies of its past; the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted.[274][275] Under the current constitution, the CPV is the only party allowed to rule, the operation of all other political parties being outlawed. Other human rights issues concern freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press. In 2009, Vietnamese lawyer Lê Công Định was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested. Amnesty International described him and his arrested associates as prisoners of conscience. Vietnam has also suffered from human trafficking and related issues.[278][279][280]\n\nThroughout the history of Vietnam, its economy has been based largely on agriculture—primarily wet rice cultivation. Bauxite, an important material in the production of aluminium, is mined in central Vietnam. Since reunification, the country's economy is shaped primarily by the CPV through Five Year Plans decided upon at the plenary sessions of the Central Committee and national congresses. The collectivisation of farms, factories, and capital goods was carried out as part of the establishment of central planning, with millions of people working for state enterprises. Under strict state control, Vietnam's economy continued to be plagued by inefficiency, corruption in state-owned enterprises, poor quality and underproduction. With the decline in economic aid from its main trading partner, the Soviet Union, following the erosion of the Eastern bloc in the late 1980s, and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the negative impacts of the post-war trade embargo imposed by the United States, Vietnam began to liberalise its trade by devaluing its exchange rate to increase exports and embarked on a policy of economic development.\n\nIn 1986, the Sixth National Congress of the CPV introduced socialist-oriented market economic reforms as part of the Đổi Mới reform programme. Private ownership began to be encouraged in industry, commerce and agriculture and state enterprises were restructured to operate under market constraints. This led to the five-year economic plans being replaced by the socialist-oriented market mechanism. As a result of these reforms, Vietnam achieved approximately 8% annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth between 1990 and 1997. The United States ended its economic embargo against Vietnam in early 1994. Although the 1997 Asian financial crisis caused an economic slowdown to 4–5% growth per year, its economy began to recover in 1999, and grew at around 7% per year from 2000 to 2005, one of the fastest in the world.[296] On 11 January 2007, Vietnam became the 150th member of the WTO (World Trade Organization).[298] According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam (GSO), growth remained strong despite the late-2000s global recession, holding at 6.8% in 2010. Vietnam's year-on-year inflation rate reached 11.8% in December 2010 and the currency, the Vietnamese đồng, was devalued three times.\n\nDeep poverty, defined as the percentage of the population living on less than $1 per day, has declined significantly in Vietnam and the relative poverty rate is now less than that of China, India and the Philippines. This decline can be attributed to equitable economic policies aimed at improving living standards and preventing the rise of inequality. These policies have included egalitarian land distribution during the initial stages of the Đổi Mới programme, investment in poorer remote areas, and subsidising of education and healthcare. Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has applied sequenced trade liberalisation, a two-track approach opening some sectors of the economy to international markets. Manufacturing, information technology and high-tech industries now form a large and fast-growing part of the national economy. Although Vietnam is a relative newcomer to the oil industry, it is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia with a total 2011 output of 318,000 barrels per day (50,600 m3/d). In 2010, Vietnam was ranked as the eighth-largest crude petroleum producer in the Asia and Pacific region. The US bought the biggest share of Vietnam's exports, while goods from China were the most popular Vietnamese import.\n\nBased on findings by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2022, the unemployment rate in Vietnam was 2.3%, the nominal GDP US$406.452 billion, and a nominal GDP per capita $4,086.[12] Besides the primary sector economy, tourism has contributed significantly to Vietnam's economic growth with 7.94 million foreign visitors recorded in 2015.\n\nAs a result of several land reform measures, Vietnam has become a major exporter of agricultural products. It is now the world's largest producer of cashew nuts, with a one-third global share; the largest producer of black pepper, accounting for one-third of the world's market; and the second-largest rice exporter in the world after Thailand since the 1990s. Subsequently, Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee. The country has the highest proportion of land use for permanent crops together with other states in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Other primary exports include tea, rubber and fishery products. Agriculture's share of Vietnam's GDP has fallen in recent decades, declining from 42% in 1989 to 20% in 2006 as production in other sectors of the economy has risen.\n\nThe overall fisheries production of Vietnam from capture fisheries and aquaculture was 5.6 million MT in 2011 and 6.7 million MT in 2016. The output of Vietnam's fisheries sector has seen strong growth, which could be attributed to the continued expansion of the aquaculture sub-sector.[317]\n\nIn 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology amounted to roughly 0.45% of its GDP. Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in mathematics. Hoàng Tụy pioneered the applied mathematics field of global optimisation in the 20th century, while Ngô Bảo Châu won the 2010 Fields Medal for his proof of fundamental lemma in the theory of automorphic forms. Since the establishment of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST) by the government in 1975, the country is working to develop its first national space flight programme especially after the completion of the infrastructure at the Vietnam Space Centre (VSC) in 2018. Vietnam has also made significant advances in the development of robots, such as the TOPIO humanoid model. One of Vietnam's main messaging apps, Zalo, was developed by Vương Quang Khải, a Vietnamese hacker who later worked with the country's largest information technology service company, the FPT Group.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Vietnam devoted 0.19% of its GDP to science research and development in 2011. Vietnam was ranked 44th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, it has increased its ranking considerably since 2012, where it was ranked 76th.[328][329] Between 2005 and 2014, the number of Vietnamese scientific publications recorded in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science increased at a rate well above the average for Southeast Asia, albeit from a modest starting point. Publications focus mainly on life sciences (22%), physics (13%) and engineering (13%), which is consistent with recent advances in the production of diagnostic equipment and shipbuilding.\n\nTourism is an important element of economic activity in the nation, contributing 7.5% of the total GDP. Vietnam hosted roughly 13 million tourists in 2017, an increase of 29.1% over the previous year, making it one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the world. The vast majority of the tourists in the country, some 9.7 million, came from Asia; namely China (4 million), South Korea (2.6 million), and Japan (798,119). Vietnam also attracts large numbers of visitors from Europe, with almost 1.9 million visitors in 2017; most European visitors came from Russia (574,164), followed by the United Kingdom (283,537), France (255,396), and Germany (199,872). Other significant international arrivals by nationality include the United States (614,117) and Australia (370,438).\n\nThe most visited destinations in Vietnam are the largest city, Ho Chi Minh City, with over 5.8 million international arrivals, followed by Hanoi with 4.6 million and Hạ Long, including Hạ Long Bay with 4.4 million arrivals. All three are ranked in the top 100 most visited cities in the world. Vietnam is home to eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2018, Travel + Leisure ranked Hội An as one of the world's top 15 best destinations to visit.\n\nMuch of Vietnam's modern transportation network can trace its roots to the French colonial era when it was used to facilitate the transportation of raw materials to its main ports. It was extensively expanded and modernised following the partition of Vietnam. Vietnam's road system includes national roads administered at the central level, provincial roads managed at the provincial level, district roads managed at the district level, urban roads managed by cities and towns and commune roads managed at the commune level. In 2010, Vietnam's road system had a total length of about 188,744 kilometres (117,280 mi) of which 93,535 kilometres (58,120 mi) are asphalt roads comprising national, provincial and district roads. The length of the national road system is about 15,370 kilometres (9,550 mi) with 15,085 kilometres (9,373 mi) of its length paved. The provincial road system has around 27,976 kilometres (17,383 mi) of paved roads while 50,474 kilometres (31,363 mi) district roads are paved.\n\nBicycles, motorcycles and motor scooters remain the most popular forms of road transport in the country, a legacy of the French, though the number of privately owned cars has been increasing in recent years. Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population. Traffic collisions remain the major safety issue of Vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people losing their lives daily. Traffic congestion is a growing problem in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City especially with the growth of individual car ownership. Vietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the Reunification Express from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi, a distance of nearly 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi). From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north, and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to Hạ Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to Thái Nguyên, and the northeast line from Hanoi to Lào Cai. In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a high-speed railway—shinkansen (bullet train)—using Japanese technology. Vietnamese engineers were sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains. The planned railway will be a 1,545 kilometres (960 mi)-long express route serving a total of 23 stations, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, with 70% of its route running on bridges and through tunnels. The trains will travel at a maximum speed of 350 kilometres (220 mi) per hour. Plans for the high-speed rail line, however, have been postponed after the Vietnamese government decided to prioritise the development of both the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City metros and expand road networks instead.\n\nVietnam operates 20 major civil airports, including three international gateways: Noi Bai in Hanoi, Da Nang International Airport in Đà Nẵng and Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Son Nhat is the country's largest airport handling the majority of international passenger traffic. According to a government-approved plan, Vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2025, including Vinh International Airport, Phu Bai International Airport, Cam Ranh International Airport, Phu Quoc International Airport, Cat Bi International Airport, Can Tho International Airport, and Long Thanh International Airport. The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2025. Vietnam Airlines, the state-owned national airline, maintains a fleet of 86 passenger aircraft and aims to operate 170 by 2020. Several private airlines also operate in Vietnam, including Air Mekong, Bamboo Airways, Jetstar Pacific Airlines, VASCO and VietJet Air. As a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including Cam Ranh, Đà Nẵng, Hải Phòng, Ho Chi Minh City, Hạ Long, Qui Nhơn, Vũng Tàu, Cửa Lò and Nha Trang. Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers plays a key role in rural transportation with over 47,130 kilometres (29,290 mi) of navigable waterways carrying ferries, barges and water taxis.\n\nVietnam's energy sector is dominated largely by the state-controlled Vietnam Electricity Group (EVN). As of 2017, EVN made up about 61.4% of the country's power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 MW. Other energy sources are PetroVietnam (4,435 MW), Vinacomin (1,785 MW) and 10,031 MW from build–operate–transfer (BOT) investors.\n\nMost of Vietnam's power is generated by either hydropower or fossil fuel power such as coal, oil and gas, while diesel, small hydropower and renewable energy supplies the remainder. The Vietnamese government had planned to develop a nuclear reactor as the path to establish another source for electricity from nuclear power. The plan was abandoned in late 2016 when a majority of the National Assembly voted to oppose the project due to widespread public concern over radioactive contamination.\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).\n\nAccording to statistics from BP, Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nTelecommunications services in Vietnam are wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the VNPT Group) which is a state-owned company. The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986. The telecom sector was reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government began to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company (Viettel, which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it owned by VNPT. VNPT's monopoly was finally ended by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree. By 2012, the top three telecom operators in Vietnam were Viettel, Vinaphone and MobiFone. The remaining companies included: EVNTelecom, Vietnammobile and S-Fone. With the shift towards a more market-orientated economy, Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment, which includes the supply of services and the establishment of nationwide telecom infrastructure.\n\nVietnam has 2,360 rivers with an average annual discharge of 310 billion m3. The rainy season accounts for 70% of the year's discharge. Most of the country's urban water supply systems have been developed without proper management within the last 10 years. Based on a 2008 survey by the Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), existing water production capacity exceeded demand, but service coverage is still sparse. Most of the clean water supply infrastructure is not widely developed. It is only available to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply. There is also concern over the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems. Most industrial factories release their untreated wastewater directly into the water sources. Where the government does not take measures to address the issue, most domestic wastewater is discharged, untreated, back into the environment and pollutes the surface water.\n\nIn recent years, there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to develop access to safe water in the country by introducing water filtration systems. There is a growing concern among local populations over the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well as the high levels of arsenic in groundwater sources. The government of Netherlands has been providing aid focusing its investments mainly on water-related sectors including water treatment projects. Regarding sanitation, 78% of Vietnam's population has access to \"improved\" sanitation—94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population. However, there are still about 21 million people in the country lacking access to \"improved\" sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015. In 2018, the construction ministry said the country's water supply, and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and information technology (IT) to sanitation issues but faced problems like limited funding, climate change, and pollution. The health ministry has also announced that water inspection units will be established nationwide beginning in June 2019. Inspections are to be conducted without notice, since there have been many cases involving health issues caused by poor or polluted water supplies as well unhygienic conditions reported every year.\n\nAs of 2021 , the population of Vietnam stands at approximately 97.5 million people. The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million. According to the 2019 census, the country's population was 96,208,984. Based on the 2019 census, 65.6% of the Vietnamese population live in rural areas while only 34.4% live in urban areas. The average growth rate of the urban population has recently increased which is attributed mainly to migration and rapid urbanisation. The dominant Viet or Kinh ethnic group constitute 82,085,826 people or 85.32% of the population. Most of their population is concentrated in the country's alluvial deltas and coastal plains. As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country. Despite this, Vietnam is also home to various ethnic groups, of which 54 are officially recognised, including the Hmong, Dao, Tày, Thái and Nùng. Many ethnic minorities such as the Muong, who are closely related to the Kinh, dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.\n\nSince the partition of Vietnam, the population of the Central Highlands was almost exclusively Degar (including more than 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a programme of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas. The Hoa (ethnic Chinese) and Khmer Krom people are mainly lowlanders. Throughout Vietnam's history, many Chinese people, largely from South China, migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees. Since the reunification in 1976, an increase of communist policies nationwide resulted in the nationalisation and confiscation of property especially from the Hoa in the south and the wealthy in cities. This led many of them to leave Vietnam.\n\nThe number of people who live in urbanised areas in 2019 is 33,122,548 people (with the urbanisation rate at 34.4%). Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the Đổi Mới economic programme, changing the system into a socialist one and liberalising property rights. As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively. The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census. Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. Any country with higher urbanisation rates has a higher GDP growth rate. Furthermore, the urbanisation movement in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country's Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large number of migrants due mainly to better weather and economic opportunities.\n\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%. In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009. In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.\n\nMany Vietnamese use mopeds for transportation, since they are relatively cheap and easy to operate. Their large numbers have been known to cause traffic congestion and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the number of mopeds increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013. With rapid development, factories have sprung up which indirectly pollute the air and water, for example in the 2016 Vietnam marine life disaster. The government is intervening and attempting solutions to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation. It has introduced more regulations for waste handling. The amount of solid waste generated in urban areas of Vietnam has increased by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste accounted for 181% of that increase. One of the government's efforts includes attempting to promote campaigns that encourage locals to sort household waste, since waste sorting is still not practised by most of Vietnamese society.\n\nThe national language of the country is Vietnamese, a tonal Austroasiatic language (Mon–Khmer), which is spoken by the majority of the population. Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including: Tày, Mường, Cham, Khmer, Chinese, Nùng, and Hmong. The Montagnard peoples of the Central Highlands also speak a number of distinct languages, some belonging to the Austroasiatic and others to the Malayo-Polynesian language families. In recent years, a number of sign languages have developed in the major cities.\n\nThe French language, a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among those educated in the former South Vietnam, where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce.[391] Vietnam remains a full member of the International Organisation of the Francophonie (La Francophonie) and education has revived some interest in the language. Russian, and to a lesser extent German, Czech and Polish are known among some northern Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. With improved relations with Western countries and recent reforms in Vietnamese administration, English has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of English is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of French. The popularity of Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin Chinese have also grown as the country's ties with other East Asian nations have strengthened. Third-graders can choose one of seven languages (English, Russian, French, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German) as their first foreign language.[399][400][401] In Vietnam's high school graduation examinations, students can take their foreign language exam in one of the above-mentioned languages.[402]\n\nUnder Article 70 of the 1992 Constitution of Vietnam, all citizens enjoy freedom of belief and religion. All religions are equal before the law and each place of worship is protected under Vietnamese state law. Religious beliefs cannot be misused to undermine state law and policies. According to a 2007 survey 81% of Vietnamese people did not believe in a god. Based on government findings in 2009, the number of religious people increased by 932,000. The official statistics, presented by the Vietnamese government to the United Nations special rapporteur in 2014, indicate the overall number of followers of recognised religions is about 24 million of a total population of almost 90 million. According to the General Statistics Office of Vietnam in 2019, Buddhists account for 4.79% of the total population, Catholics 6.1%, Protestants 1.0%, Hoahao Buddhists 1.02%, and Caodaism followers 0.58%. Other religions includes Islam, Bahaʼís and Hinduism, representing less than 0.2% of the population.\n\nThe majority of Vietnamese do not follow any organised religion, though many of them observe some form of Vietnamese folk religion. Confucianism as a system of social and ethical philosophy still has certain influences in modern Vietnam. Mahāyāna is the dominant branch of Buddhism, while Theravada is practised mostly by the Khmer minority. About 8 to 9% of the population is Christian—made up of Roman Catholics and Protestants. Catholicism was introduced to Vietnam in the 16th century and was firmly established by Jesuits missionaries (mainly Portuguese and Italian) in the 17th centuries from nearby Portuguese Macau. French missionaries (from the Paris Foreign Missions Society) together with Spanish missionaries (from the Dominican Order of the neighbouring Spanish East Indies) actively sought converts in the 18th, 19th, and first half of the 20th century. A significant number of Vietnamese people, especially in the South, are also adherents of two indigenous religions of syncretic Caodaism and quasi-Buddhist Hoahaoism. Protestantism was only recently spread by American and Canadian missionaries in the 20th century; the largest Protestant denomination is the Evangelical Church of Vietnam. Around 770,000 of the country's Protestants are members of ethnic minorities, particularly the highland Montagnards and Hmong people. Although it is one of the country's minority religions, Protestantism is the fastest-growing religion in Vietnam, expanding at a rate of 600% in recent decades. Several other minority faiths exist in Vietnam, these include: Bani, Sunni and non-denominational sections of Islam which is practised primarily among the ethnic Cham minority. There are also a few Kinh adherents of Islam, other minority adherents of Baha'i, as well as Hindus among the Cham's.\n\nVietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges, and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions. General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: kindergarten, elementary schools, middle schools, high schools, and universities. A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national literacy rate, which stood at 90% in 2008. Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country's education system continuously undergoing a series of reforms by the government. Basic education in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fees for their children without some form of public or private assistance. Regardless, Vietnam's school enrolment is among the highest in the world. The number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005. In higher education, the government provides subsidised loans for students through the national bank, although there are deep concerns about access to the loans as well the burden on students to repay them. Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education. A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including Harvard University (United States) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (Australia). The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics. In 2018, a decree on university autonomy allowing them to operate independently without ministerial control is in its final stages of approval. The government will continue investing in education especially for the poor to have access to basic education.\n\nBy 2015, 97% of the population had access to improved water sources. In 2016, Vietnam's national life expectancy stood at 80.9 years for women and 71.5 for men, and the infant mortality rate was 17 per 1,000 live births. Since the partition, North Vietnam has established a public health system that has reached down to the hamlet level. After the national reunification in 1975, a nationwide health service was established. In the late 1980s, the quality of healthcare declined to some degree as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has also contributed to a shortage of nurses, midwives and hospital beds; in 2000, Vietnam had only 24.7 hospital beds per 10,000 people before declining to 23.7 in 2005 as stated in the annual report of Vietnamese Health Ministry. The controversial use of herbicides as a chemical weapon by the US military during the war left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that persist in the country today. For instance, it led to three million Vietnamese people suffering health problems, one million birth defects caused directly by exposure to the chemical and 24% of Vietnam's land being defoliated.\n\nSince the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating malaria. The malaria mortality rate fell to about five per cent of its 1990s equivalent by 2005 after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment. Tuberculosis (TB) cases, however, are on the rise. TB has become the second most infectious disease in the country after respiratory-related illness. With an intensified vaccination programme, better hygiene and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and new TB infections. In 2004, government subsidies covering about 15% of health care expenses. That year, the United States announced Vietnam would be one of 15 states to receive funding as part of its global AIDS relief plan. By the following year, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 progressed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); 9,554 have died. The actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher. On average between 40 and 50 new infections are reported daily in the country. In 2007, 0.4% of the population was estimated to be infected with HIV and the figure has remained stable since 2005. More global aid is being delivered through The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to fight the spread of the disease in the country. In September 2018, the Hanoi People's Committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating dog and cat meat as it can cause diseases like rabies and leptospirosis. More than 1,000 stores in the capital city of Hanoi were found to be selling both meats. The decision prompted positive comments among Vietnamese on social media, though some noted that the consumption of dog meat will remain an ingrained habit among many people.\n\nVietnamese culture is considered part of Sinosphere. Vietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient Đông Sơn culture with wet rice cultivation as its economic base. Some elements of the nation's culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of Confucianism, Mahāyāna Buddhism, and Taoism in its traditional political system and philosophy. Vietnamese society is structured around làng (ancestral villages); all Vietnamese mark a common ancestral anniversary on the tenth day of the third lunar month. The influence of Chinese culture such as the Cantonese, Hakka, Hokkien, and Hainanese cultures is more evident in the north where Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture. Despite this, there are Chinatowns in the south, such as in Chợ Lớn, where many Chinese have intermarried with Kinh and are indistinguishable among them. In the central and southern parts of Vietnam, traces of Champa and Khmer culture are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient Sa Huỳnh culture. In recent centuries, Western cultures have become popular among recent generations of Vietnamese.\n\nThe traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are based on humanity (nhân nghĩa) and harmony (hòa) in which family and community values are highly regarded. Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols, such as the Vietnamese dragon which is derived from crocodile and snake imagery; Vietnam's national father, Lạc Long Quân is depicted as a holy dragon. The lạc is a holy bird representing Vietnam's national mother Âu Cơ. Other prominent images that are also revered are the turtle, buffalo and horse. Many Vietnamese also believe in the supernatural and spiritualism where illness can be brought on by a curse or sorcery or caused by non-observance of a religious ethic. Traditional medical practitioners, amulets and other forms of spiritual protection and religious practices may be employed to treat the ill person. In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programmes. For many decades, foreign cultural influences, especially those of Western origin, were shunned. But since the recent reformation, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to neighbouring Southeast Asian, East Asian as well to Western culture and media.\n\nThe main Vietnamese formal dress, the áo dài is worn for special occasions such as weddings and religious festivals. White áo dài is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across the country. Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include: the áo tứ thân, a four-piece woman's dress; the áo ngũ, a form of the thân in five-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the yếm, a woman's undergarment; the áo bà ba, rural working \"pyjamas\" for men and women; the áo gấm, a formal brocade tunic for government receptions; and the áo the, a variant of the áo gấm worn by grooms at weddings. Traditional headwear includes the standard conical nón lá, the \"lampshade-like\" nón quai thao, and the traditional turban, khăn vấn. In tourism, a number of popular cultural tourist destinations include the former Imperial City of Huế, the World Heritage Sites of Phong Nha – Kẻ Bàng National Park, Hội An and Mỹ Sơn, coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of Hạ Long Bay and the Marble Mountains.\n\nVietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of folk literature based on the typical six–to-eight-verse poetic form (lục bát) called ca dao which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes. Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century Ngô dynasty, with notable ancient authors including: Nguyễn Trãi, Hồ Xuân Hương, Nguyễn Du and Nguyễn Đình Chiểu. Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as hát nói in ca trù. Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the tao đàn. Vietnamese literature has been influenced by Western styles in recent times, with the first literary transformation movement of thơ mới emerging in 1932. Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms. It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed). Folk literature usually exists in many versions, passed down orally, and has unknown authors. Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life. They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (Lạc Long Quân and Âu Cơ), culture heroes (Sơn Tinh and Thủy Tinh) which are referred to as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales.\n\nTraditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions. Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal. The origins of Vietnamese classical opera (tuồng) can be traced to the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a Chinese opera troupe. Throughout its history, Vietnam has been the most heavily impacted by the Chinese musical tradition along with those of Japan, Korea and Mongolia. Nhã nhạc is the most popular form of imperial court music, Chèo is a form of generally satirical musical theatre, while Xẩm or hát xẩm (xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese folk music. Quan họ (alternate singing) is popular in the former Hà Bắc province (which is now divided into Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang provinces) and across Vietnam. Another form of music called Hát chầu văn or hát văn is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies. Nhạc dân tộc cải biên is a modern form of Vietnamese folk music which arose in the 1950s, while ca trù (also known as hát ả đào) is a popular folk music. Hò can be thought of as the southern style of Quan họ. There is a range of traditional instruments, including the đàn bầu (a monochord zither), the đàn gáo (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the đàn nguyệt (a two-stringed fretted moon lute). In recent times, there have been some efforts at mixing Vietnamese traditional music—especially folk music—with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educate the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles. Bolero music has gained popularity in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style—a combination of traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements. In the 21st century, the modern Vietnamese pop music industry known as V-pop incorporates elements of many popular genres worldwide, such as electronic, dance and R&B.\n\nVietnam's media sector is regulated by the government under the 2004 Law on Publication. It is generally perceived that the country's media sector is controlled by the government and follows the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken. The Voice of Vietnam (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website, while Vietnam Television (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has regulated public internet access extensively using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the \"Bamboo Firewall\". The collaborative project OpenNet Initiative classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be \"pervasive\", while Reporters Without Borders (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global \"internet enemies\". Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content, many political and religious websites that are deemed to be undermining state authority are also blocked.\n\nTraditionally, Vietnamese cuisine is based around five fundamental taste \"elements\" (Vietnamese: ngũ vị): spicy (metal), sour (wood), salty (water), bitter (fire) and sweet (earth). Common ingredients include fish sauce, shrimp paste, soy sauce, rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use: lemongrass, ginger, mint, Vietnamese mint, long coriander, Saigon cinnamon, bird's eye chilli, lime and basil leaves. Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables; it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide. The use of meats such as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past. Instead freshwater fish, crustaceans (particularly crabs), and molluscs became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. Vietnam has a strong street food culture, with 40 popular dishes commonly found throughout the country. Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as gỏi cuốn (salad roll), bánh cuốn (rice noodle roll), bún riêu (rice vermicelli soup) and phở noodles originated in the north and were introduced to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants. Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes, as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices. Black pepper is frequently used in place of chillis to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with ice cubes, especially during the annual hot seasons; in contrast, in the north hot drinks are more preferable in a colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include cà phê đá (Vietnamese iced coffee), cà phê trứng (egg coffee), chanh muối (salted pickled lime juice), cơm rượu (glutinous rice wine), nước mía (sugarcane juice) and trà sen (Vietnamese lotus tea).\n\nThe country has eleven national recognised holidays. These include: New Year's Day on 1 January; Vietnamese New Year (Tết Nguyên Đán) from the last day of the last lunar month to fifth day of the first lunar month; Hùng Kings' Festival on the 10th day of the third lunar month; Reunification Day on 30 April; International Workers' Day on 1 May; and National Day on 2 September. During Tết, many Vietnamese from the major cities will return to their villages for family reunions and to pray for dead ancestors. Older people will usually give the young a lì xì (red envelope) while special holiday food, such as bánh chưng (rice cake) in a square shape together with variety of dried fruits, are presented in the house for visitors. Many other festivals are celebrated throughout the seasons, including the Tết Nguyên Tiêu, Tết Trung Thu and various temple and nature festivals. In the highlands, Elephant Race Festivals are held annually during the spring; riders will ride their elephants for about 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and the winning elephant will be given sugarcane. Traditional Vietnamese weddings remain widely popular.\n\nThe Vovinam, Kim Kê and Võ Bình Định are widespread in Vietnam, while football is the country's most popular sport. Its national team won the ASEAN Football Championship twice in 2008 and 2018 and reached the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, quarter-finals of 2019 AFC Asian Cup, its junior team of under-23 became the runners-up of 2018 AFC U-23 Championship and reached fourth place in 2018 Asian Games, while the under-20 managed to qualify the 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup for the first time in their football history. And the under-17 achieved the fourth place per 10 Teams of the 2000 AFC U-16 Championship. The women's national football team had first appearance at the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2023, became the first 11-a-side national football team to participate in a World Cup tournament, and also traditionally dominates the Southeast Asian Games, along with its chief rival, Thailand. Other Western sports such as badminton, tennis, volleyball, ping-pong and chess are also widely popular. Vietnam has participated in the Summer Olympic Games since 1952. After the partition of the country in 1954, only South Vietnam competed in the games, sending athletes to the 1956 and 1972 Olympics. Since the reunification of Vietnam in 1976, it has competed as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, attending every Summer Olympics from 1988 onwards. The present Vietnam Olympic Committee was formed in 1976 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1979. Vietnam has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games. In 2016, Vietnam won their first gold medal at the Olympics. Basketball has become an increasingly popular sport in Vietnam, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi and Sóc Trăng.[509]\n• Portal of the Government of Vietnam Archived 20 May 2020 at the Wayback Machine\n• Communist Party of Vietnam – official website (in Vietnamese)\n• Robert N.

It is the official language of Andorra, and an official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, where it is called Valencian (valencià). It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero,[3] and it is spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of Aragon and the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Països Catalans or \"Catalan Countries\".[4]\n\nThe language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.\n\nThe word Catalan is derived from the territorial name of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin: Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ('Land of the Goths'), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.\n\nIn English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from Middle French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word Catalan can be pronounced in English as KAT-ə-lən, -⁠lan or KAT-ə-LAN.[9][10]\n\nThe endonym is pronounced [kətəˈla] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [kataˈla] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community and Carche, the term valencià [valensiˈa] is frequently used instead. Thus, the name \"Valencian\", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian Community and Carche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole,[11] synonymous with \"Catalan\".[11] Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL)[note 1] and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC).[note 2] (See also status of Valencian below).\n\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.\n\nIn the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the lands that would become the Kingdoms of Valencia and the Majorca. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.\n\nIn the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232–1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th–14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March (1397–1459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language. Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms \"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\".\n\nMartorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.[16]\n\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the laws of each territory before the respective parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups.[18][19] Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.[20][21][22][23][24][neutrality is disputed]\n\nThe process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed\".[25] From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to \"represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish\".[25] The use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of Catalan. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.\n\nWith the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.[26]\n\nShortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.\n\nAfter the French colony of Algeria was established in 1830, many Catalan-speaking settlers moved there. People from the Spanish province of Alicante settled around Oran, while those from French Catalonia and Menorca migrated to Algiers.\n\nBy 1911, there were around 100,000 speakers of Patuet,[27] as their speech was called.[28] After the Algerian declaration of independence in 1962, almost all the Pied-Noir Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia[29] or Alicante.\n\nThe French government only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the then General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the départment's languages[31] and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.\n\nIn 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only Catalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate Catalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in Barcelona was also asked. He declared that Catalan \"is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses\", indicating that it was spoken everywhere \"with the exception of the royal courts\". He also indicated that Catalan was spoken \"in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d \"Aran and Cerdaña\".[32]\n\nThe defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the Catalan language declined into the 18th century.\n\nHowever, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixença), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimerà (drama). In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. Catalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan lifted. The Generalitat (the autonomous government of Catalonia, established during the Republic in 1931) made a normal use of Catalan in its administration and put efforts to promote it at the social level, including in schools and the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan language and culture were still vibrant during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), but were crushed at an unprecedented level throughout the subsequent decades due to Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), which abolished the official status of Catalan and imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain, while banning the use of Catalan in them.[35] Between 1939 and 1943 newspapers and book printing in Catalan almost disappeared.[36] Francisco Franco's desire for a homogeneous Spanish population resonated with some Catalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of Catalan. Despite all of these hardships, Catalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Franco's dictatorship. At the end of World War II, however, some of the harsh measures began to be lifted and, while Spanish language remained the sole promoted one, limited number of Catalan literature began to be tolerated. Several prominent Catalan authors resisted the suppression through literature.[37] Private initiative contests were created to reward works in Catalan, among them Joan Martorell prize (1947), Víctor Català prize (1953) Carles Riba award (1950), or the Honor Award of Catalan Letters (1969).[38] The first Catalan-language TV show was broadcast in 1964.[39] At the same time, oppression of the Catalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers.[40]\n\nIn addition to the loss of prestige for Catalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into Catalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of Catalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. Catalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual.[41] Daily newspapers remained exclusively in Spanish until after Franco's death, when the first one in Catalan since the end of the Civil War, Avui, began to be published in 1976.[42]\n\nSince the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), Catalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations—if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students.[44] There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan.\n\nMore recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the Catalan educational system.[45] As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme Court urged the Catalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.[46]\n\nAccording to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish.[47] In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5% with Spanish.[48] To promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories, with entities such as Consorci per a la Normalització Lingüística [ca; es] (Consortium for Linguistic Normalization).[49][50]\n\nIn Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring Catalan have been enforced, such as Catalan medium education.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern Catalonia area of France, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.\n\nIn Alicante province, Catalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.\n\nDuring the 20th century many Catalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and other South American countries. They formed a large number of Catalan colonies that today continue to maintain the Catalan language.[51] They also founded many Catalan casals (associations).[52]\n\nOne classification of Catalan is given by Pèire Bèc:\n\nHowever, the ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ramón Menéndez Pidal.\n\nCatalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.\n\nSome include Catalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon dialect) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century[53] and still today remains its closest relative.[54]\n\nCatalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Provençal, French, Gallo-Italian).[58]\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.[1]\n\nDuring much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), the Catalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and Catalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).\n\nThere is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century AD, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir \"to boil\") and innovatory regionalisms (Spanish novillo, Asturian nuviellu vs. Catalan torell, Occitan taurèl \"bullock\"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.\n\nLike all Romance languages, Catalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:\n• verbs: 'to fasten; transfix' > 'to compose, write up', > 'to combine, conjugate', > 'to wake; awaken', 'to thicken; crowd together' > 'to save, keep', > 'to miss, yearn, pine for', 'to investigate, track' > Old Catalan enagar 'to incite, induce', > Old Catalan ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', > 'to appease, mollify', > 'to reject, refuse';\n\nThe Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang \"mud\" and rostir \"to roast\", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa \"spinning wheel\" and templa \"temple\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.\n\nThe same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alfàbia \"large earthenware jar\" and rajola \"tile\", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli \"oil\" and oliva \"olive\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element is generally much more prevalent in Spanish.\n\nSituated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar \"to miss somebody\", apaivagar \"to calm somebody down\", and rebutjar \"reject\".\n\nTraditionally Catalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Països Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.\n\nThe number of people known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9–9.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken.[69] The web site of the Generalitat de Catalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan.[70] These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the Catalan population.[71] According to Ethnologue, Catalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.[1]\n\nAccording to a 2011 study the total number of Catalan speakers was over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them spoke Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia).[72] Very few Catalan monoglots exist; virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with 99.7% of Catalan speakers in Catalonia able to speak Spanish and 99.9% able to understand it.[73]\n\nIn Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia predominantly spoke Catalan at home whereas 52.7% spoke Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.[74]\n\nSpanish was the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to 2013 census, Catalan was also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it was understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of two could speak it (1,137,816), 79% could read it (1,246.555), and 53% could write it (835,080).[75] The share of Barcelona residents who could speak it (72.3%)[76] was lower than that of the overall Catalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 spoke the language. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with French in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra, and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n\nIn contrast to other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic (\"male friend\") vs. amiga (\"female friend\").\n\nCentral Catalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety.[85] For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ, e/.\n\nIn Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).\n\nThe consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative.\n• has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects such as Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan.\n• occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. It has merged with elsewhere.\n• Voiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: > , > , > . Exceptions include after lateral consonants, and after . In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, 100 except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.\n• There is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of , , , . Some sources describe them as \"postalveolar\". Others as \"back alveolo-palatal\", implying that the characters ⟨ ⟩ would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use ⟨ ⟩ for other languages such as Polish and Chinese. 104 105\n• The distribution of the two rhotics and closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case appears.\n• In careful speech, , , may be geminated. Geminated may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics. 108\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.\n• Lenition of voiced stops as in Galician and Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n• Abundance of and occurring at the end of words, as for instance moll (\"wet\") and any (\"year\"), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.\n\nIn contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ('male friend') vs. amiga ('female friend').\n\nCatalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of Catalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of Catalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the Catalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).\n• Variations of Catalan by class, gender, profession, age and level of studies\n• Relations between Catalan and Spanish or French\n• Perception on the language of Catalan speakers and non-speakers\n• Presence of Catalan in several fields: tagging, public function, media, professional sectors\n\nThe dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%.[1] The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.\n\nCatalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.\n\nWestern Catalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Roussillonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms \"Catalan\" and \"Valencian\" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) refer to two varieties of the same language.[116] There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of Catalan Studies in Catalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian Community.\n\nCentral Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.\n\nCatalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.\n\nIn Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced [e], [o] in some words. Algherese has lowered [ə] to [a].\n\nIn Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o, ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.\n\nIn Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, ɛ/ > [e]; /o, ɔ/ > [o]; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.\n\nCentral, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/. Usually, words with /ɛ/ in Central Catalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in Central and Western Catalan as well.[vague] As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of /ɛ/.\n\nCatalan dialects are characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, ɾ/) and two laterals ((/l, ʎ/).\n\nMost Catalan dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarization of /l/ → [ɫ]), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation).\n\nThere is dialectal variation in regard to:\n• The pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).\n• While, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard Catalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like Central Valencian and Ribagorçan only have three or four.\n• The usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme .\n• The pronunciation or not of yod ( ) in the digraph .\n• The elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either or ).\n• The delateralization of the palatal lateral approximant ( ).\n• The alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as in 'village, people' → vs. vs. vs. vs. ).\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian Community, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian Community and Western Catalonia.\n\nE.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western Catalan).\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -∅ in all conjugations. \n\nE.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca/-esca.\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.\n\nWestern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'.\n\nEastern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western Catalan in this case[123]).\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nStandard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern Catalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.\n\nThe most notable difference between both standards is some tonic ⟨e⟩ accentuation, for instance: francès, anglès (IEC) – francés, anglés (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent ⟨è⟩, while pronouncing it as /e/ rather than /ɛ/, in some words such as: què ('what'), or València. Other divergences include the use of ⟨tl⟩ (AVL) in some words instead of ⟨tll⟩ like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, such as subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').\n\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').\n\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- /v/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of algú ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns. In 1999, Catalan (Algherese dialect) was among the twelve minority languages officially recognized as Italy's \"historical linguistic minorities\" by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999.[125]\n\nIn 2011,[126] the Aragonese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon) as originally provided for by Law 10/2009.[127] The new entity, designated as Institut Aragonès del Català, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.\n\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.[1]\n\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan varieties.[11]\n\nThe AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of Castelló (Normes de Castelló). Currently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses an independent standard for Valencian.\n\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004[129] showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan.[130]\n\nThis clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.[131]\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nLiterary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others.\n\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Roís de Corella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Catalan.\n\nThe process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where inflection is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [əˈlɛktri ] (\"electrical\") vs. electricitat [ələktri iˈtat]. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure (\"foresee\").\n\nThere is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.\n\nCatalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogràfiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castelló de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castelló, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.[134]\n\nThe grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:\n• Use of definite and indefinite articles.\n• Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.\n• Verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\n• There are no modal auxiliaries.\n• Word order is freer than in English.\n\nIn gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by ø/-a. There are only a few exceptions, such as minso/minsa (\"scarce\"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:\n• Loss of : / (\"flat\") vs. / (\"second\")\n\nCatalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and gall/gallina (\"cock\"/\"hen\"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.\n\nThere is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.\n\nAs in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols/les pols (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").\n\nThe inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, such as dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).\n\nCentral Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.\n\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).\n\nCatalan pronouns exhibit T–V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\n\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.\n\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar (\"to go\") + infinitive.\n\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject–verb–object.[142] However, word order is very flexible. Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train\".\n\nIn Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i (\"and\").[145]\n\nSelected text from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n• Gramàtica Normativa Valenciana (Valencian grammar).

Anyway, I saw Police Academy in a packed cinema when it was first released, and the cinema burst into laughter big time. For those watching Police Academy on VHS, DVD or streaming, would you get the same laughs, I don't know I guess. Still, Police Academy is a classic although the sequels not so much.Police Academy (film) - Wikipedia: Police Academy is a 1984 American comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson in his directorial debut, and distributed by Warner Bros..[4] Its storyline follows a new recruitment policy for an unnamed city's police academy to take in any recruit who wishes to apply and study to become a police officer. The film stars Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, and G. W. Bailey.\n\nThe film was produced by The Ladd Company. It premiered on March 23, 1984.[5] It grossed $8.5 million in its opening weekend and more than $149 million worldwide, against a budget of $4.8 million, and remains the most successful film of the series as of 2022.[3] The film spawned six sequels in the Police Academy franchise, and is the only film in the franchise to be rated R by the MPAA.\n\nIn an unnamed city, the mayor announces that the Metropolitan Police must accept all willing applicants for training, regardless of their suitability for the role. Hundreds of citizens, who never thought they could be police officers, apply: rich girl Karen Thompson; former criminal and human beatbox Larvell Jones; gentle giant Moses Hightower, gun fanatic Eugene Tackleberry; lothario George Martin; soft-spoken Laverne Hooks; accident-prone Douglas Fackler; and bullied Leslie Barbara. Rebellious underachiever, Carey Mahoney, arrested for yet another petty crime, is given a chance to escape prison time by Captain Reed, a friend of his father: enroll in the academy and complete training. Mahoney agrees, planning to misbehave and be forced out, but he learns from Commandant Eric Lassard that he cannot quit or be rejected until training is complete.\n\nDismayed at being forced to take undesirable recruits, Police chief Henry Hurst plots to make the training unbearable so they will willingly quit. Several cadets drop out while training under the ruthless Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris. Harris targets Mahoney, believing his behaviour is preventing him from training actual officers, but when given the chance to quit, Mahoney declines as he and Karen have developed a mutual attraction. Cadets Copeland and Blankes are chosen as squad leaders by Harris to help him torment Mahoney and spy on the other recruits. Copeland and Blankes investigate a party hosted by Mahoney, who uses Barbara to trick them into attending the Blue Oyster Bar, a gay biker bar, where they are intimidated into dancing with the patrons. In revenge, they hide a prostitute in Barbara's dorm room before a room inspection to get him expelled. Mahoney attempts to smuggle her off campus, but they are forced to hide under a lectern just as Lassard leads a presentation to a group of fellow officers. The prostitute covertly performs fellatio on Lassard while he is speaking, and when Lassard later sees Mahoney sneak out, he assumes Mahoney performed the act.\n\nHightower requests Mahoney's help in learning to drive before the cadet driving test. The pair steal Copeland's small, two-door Honda to practice in, evade a police pursuit, and leave it heavily damaged. Following Hightower's successful completion of the test, Copeland racially insults Laverne after she drives over his feet. Enraged, Hightower overturns a police cruiser with Copeland inside it, leading to his ejection from the academy, to the dismay of his fellow cadets. Copeland and Blankes attempt to make Mahoney fight them over Copeland's destroyed car, but he refuses, knowing they are trying to get him thrown out. Barbara stands up for Mahoney and strikes Copeland first, leading to a brawl. Harris threatens to eject Barbara, but Mahoney takes the blame to protect him and is expelled from the academy.\n\nMeanwhile, Fackler throws an apple from his police car during patrol, inadvertently striking a man who mistakenly assumes someone else is responsible, starting a fight which escalates into a city-wide riot. Before he can leave, Mahoney joins the deployed cadets to tackle the disorder, but they find themselves inadvertently transported into the center of the riots and heavily outnumbered. One criminal steals Blankes and Copeland's revolvers and takes Harris hostage on a rooftop. Mahoney tries to help, but the criminal threatens to kill Harris and Mahoney is forced to surrender. Hightower, having followed the chaos, arrives and deceives the criminal into thinking he is on his side, before throwing him down a flight of stairs where he is arrested by Laverne.\n\nAt the cadet graduation ceremony, Mahoney and Hightower have been reinstated to the academy and receive the highest commendations for their bravery. Mahoney prepares to give a speech, but it is revealed that Lassard has hidden the prostitute beneath the Lectern to take revenge on Mahoney.\n\nThe producers considered Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks, and Judge Reinhold for the role of Carey Mahoney.[6] Bruce Willis auditioned for the role of Carey Mahoney.[7]\n\nPaul Maslansky says he got the idea for the film when in San Francisco filming The Right Stuff:\n\nMaslansky said he wondered \"But what if they actually made it?\"[8] He took the idea to Alan Ladd Jr., who agreed to finance.[8] Neal Israel was hired to write the script with Pat Proft. Israel said:\n\nDom DeLuise was considered to direct the film but he was unavailable.[9] Hugh Wilson was hired as director based on his success with WKRP in Cincinnati, even though he was not familiar with many films of this genre. He then saw a lot of those sort. saying \"it was fairly discouraging. This immediately convinced me to cut down on the sleaze. I asked for, and got, the power to refine the Israel-Proft script. Maintaining that 'funny is money,' I wanted to go for real laughter rather than going for the elements such as gratuitous sex and anti-Establishment exploits. I wanted jokes which were rooted in reality.\"[8]\n\nMaslansky says Wilson \"took a lot of the vulgarity out; some of the very things I considered necessary. I worried that it was becoming more homogenized, and I told Hugh, \"Let's keep some of the flatulence in.\"[8]\n\nWilson says \"I found out that the shower scene, the party scene, and the fellatio scene were obligatory; I had to put them in. So I was stuck with trying to make those scenes as artistic as possible.\"[8]\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, about \"20 of the major elements in the movie\" remain from the Israel and Proft version. Israel says that when Wilson and Maslansky turned in their rewrite to the Ladd Company, \"it was rejected and the project was almost shelved. Only when they put back in dozens of our gags did the project get the go ahead.\"[8]\n\nSome of the scenes Wilson was unhappy with included the fellatio scene and the scene where a police sergeant was hurled into the backside of a horse. A compromise was reached where these acts were not actually directly shown.[8]\n\n\"I realize that you can carry grossness, rudeness, and crudeness just so far before the audience finds it terribly repetitive and not so funny,\" said Wilson. \"After the enormous success of Police Academy, I no longer believe that you have to show the female breast or make cruel ethnic jokes, not to mention the rampant sexism. And you don't have to reproduce the sounds that an overfed body makes.\"[8]\n\nOpening scenes were shot in Toronto, Ontario. The camera booth scene was shot on the Cherry Street Bridge in Toronto.[10] The academy itself was previously the site of the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in Etobicoke, and has since become the Lakeshore campus of Humber College.[11] The studio scenes were shot at Lakeshore Film Studios; the city scenes were filmed in various parts of Toronto.[12] The riot scenes was filmed at Kensington Market in Toronto.

Suspects wanted for mugging the camera [...] with the intent to incite a laugh riot. Please respond to this blues burlesque, a uniformly funny hit sure to have a long run.

The film tells the story of a young Jewish girl who, after being separated from her father in Soviet Russia, grows up in England and moves to Paris as a young adult, shortly before the beginning of World War II. It is the last film worked on by the French cinematographer Sacha Vierny.\n\nFegele Abramovich (Christina Ricci), a Russian Jew is separated from her father (Oleg Yankovsky) as a child in 1927. Her father has travelled to America to seek his fortune and plans to send for Fegele and her grandmother. Before leaving, he sings \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\" from the Bizet opera Les pêcheurs de perles to her. After her father leaves, the village is attacked and burned in a pogrom. Fegele escapes with the help of neighbours; after overcoming many obstacles, she is crowded onto a boat headed for Britain, with only a photo of her father and a coin given to her by her grandmother.\n\nUpon arrival, an English official renames her \"Susan\" and places her with foster parents. English students at school taunt her by calling her a \"gypsy\", but she does not yet understand English. A teacher at the school overhears her singing \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\" in Yiddish, and teaches her to sing and speak in English.\n\nTime passes, and Suzie auditions for a singing dance troupe heading for Paris. There, she meets an older Russian dancer named Lola (Cate Blanchett), and they share an apartment as friends. At a formal party, both women perform as dancers alongside a mysterious performing horseman, Cesar (Johnny Depp), a Romani to whom Suzie is attracted. After their performance outside, they overhear a tenor inside singing \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\"; the voice belongs to Dante (John Turturro), an Italian opera singer who immediately catches Lola's eye. Lola works her way into his good graces and falls for his charms, enticed by his wealth and success. Dante, Lola, Suzie, and Cesar all work for an opera company directed by Felix Perlman (Harry Dean Stanton). Dante is an imperious follower of Mussolini; this alienates him from Suzie even as he becomes Lola's lover. Meanwhile, Cesar introduces Suzie to his \"family\" (essentially his entire tribe), and they fall in love.\n\nOne day, Dante is rifling through Suzie's things after a dalliance with Lola in the apartment, and deduces her Jewish heritage after finding her father's photo. An elderly Jewish neighbour downstairs, Madame Goldstein (Miriam Karlin), also knows that Suzie is Jewish and has warned her of the dangers on the horizon as the Germans invade Poland. The following year, as the Germans invade France and approach Paris, an exodus begins of Jews and other people threatened by Nazism. Crowds for the operatic show dwindle, and eventually the only cast members left are Dante and Suzie. When Dante attempts to seduce Suzie, she rebuffs him. He lashes out at her for her heritage and her relationship with Cesar, whose heritage he also scorns. Perlman comes to her defence; he reminds Dante that as an Italian in Paris at that time, should Mussolini align with the Nazis, Dante's own position in Paris would be precarious. Perlman closes down the show; the Nazis enter Paris the following morning.\n\nDante reluctantly returns to his earlier role as minstrel. After another rebuff from Suzie, Dante reveals to a German officer that Suzie is a Jew. Lola overhears this and informs Suzie that she is in danger and must leave Paris. Lola has also decided to leave Dante and has purchased tickets for Suzie and herself on an ocean liner headed for America. The same night of the party, the Nazis attack the Romani village and kill a child. When Cesar comes to her apartment to say goodbye, Suzie expresses her desire to stay and help Cesar fight the Nazis for his family, but he tells her she must flee and find her father. They share a tender last evening together.\n\nDuring the ocean passage the liner is torpedoed, with Lola killed in the sinking. Suzie is among the survivors rescued and brought to New York.\n\nSuzie searches for her father and discovers that he changed his name, gave up singing, and moved west after hearing about the attack on his home village, which he assumed killed all the members of his family. Suzie goes to Hollywood where her father has established himself into a studio head, and discovers he has a new family and that he is dying. She goes to the hospital, walks past his new wife and children who are waiting outside the door to his room, and is reunited with her father. He recognizes her and expresses joy at her appearance. She sits on the side of his bed and sings \"Je Crois Entendre Encore\" to him in Yiddish as tears roll down his face.\n\nThe singing voices for the characters of Dante and Suzie were provided by Salvatore Licitra and Iva Bittova, respectively.[5]\n\nThe film was first presented at the Venice Film Festival on 2 September 2000. The film screened at the London Film Festival; the Mar del Plata Film Festival, Argentina; the Tokyo International Film Festival & the Reykjavik Film Festival, Iceland among others.\n\nThe film received mixed to negative reviews, currently holding a 35% 'rotten' rating on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes. The consensus, based on 69 reviews, says 'The storyline is overwrought and awkward, and the audience is distanced from the flatly drawn characters.'[6] Metacritic calculated an average score of 40 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[7]\n\nThe Man Who Cried: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released 22 May 2001. It features new music composed by Osvaldo Golijov, and was produced by Sally Potter and performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra Covent Garden, Salvatore Licitra, and Taraf de Haïdouks.[8]\n• The Man Who Cried at IMDb\n• The Man Who Cried at Rotten Tomatoes\n• The Man Who Cried at Box Office MojoThe Man Who Cried (2000) ⭐ 6.1 | Drama, Music, Romance: I did not know what to expect when I watched this film. What I did not anticipate, was that it would be so poignantly moving...very few films can actually reach out and involve the viewer to such an extent. There are many words that come to mind - haunting, sad, sweet, poetic...yet none of them capture the true essence of The Man Who Cried.\n\n\n\nSally Potter has done a wonderful job. This film suggests - it never really comes out and blatantly states. The scene with Cate Blanchette in the swimming pool is particularly beautiful. This film is so visually appealing - the graceful lines, the shadows, the colours...and that wonderful haunting music. Ms. Potter takes you into the minds of her characters, while the story floats and drifts around you in a collage of beautiful rich tones. She doesn't attempt to conceal the ugly face of war, but does not depict explicit violence as so many other directors do.\n\n\n\nJohnny Depp and Christina Ricci are perfectly cast - unusual roles for both. They bring depth, intensity and meaning to their characters. Unlike Sleepy Hollow, this film is gentle and strong at once, while retaining something of the same gothic charm. Cate Balnchette also surprised me with her very unusual portrayal of Lola.\n\n\n\nI would watch this movie all over again...and again...and again!Reddit - Dive into anything: I got the miscellaneous objective from the inn but the man I’m supposed to speak with has no option regarding the quest. Any help?\n\nEDIT: Nothing seems to help but I found an interesting letter when pickpocketing Falk Firebeard. It is directed to me and it says: ”Over the last few days we’ve had some disturbing information come to light regarding the events at Wolfskull Cave and the summoning and binding ritual you interrupted there.\n\nGiven your involvement with that event I’m asking you to return to Solitude to help us once more. I’m wary of putting all the details in print, please come see me at The Blue Palace.\n\nShould I load a previous save before pickpocketing the letter and wait for a courier to bring it to me? I should mention that no new objective appeared after reading the letter and I’ve never been to Wolfskull Cave before.\n\nEDIT 2: Problem solved. Thank you for the replies. For anyone else having the same problem: I downloaded a USSEP patch mod and after that I started the civil war questline, sided with the stormcloacks and did as many quests as I could. Now the dialogue started at the blue palace.The Man Who Cried (TV Movie 1993) ⭐ 6.7 | Drama: Let me start by saying Catherine Cookson was a very popular British novelist who sold something like 100 million books during her career. If her books had been like this boiler plate TV production she would not have sold 100 books. \n\n\n\nHere is the story: A man abruptly leaves a failed marriage and travels with his son to Northern England where he eventually has to marry again (and thus commit bigamy). Wife finds him....soap twists and turns abound--second wife Hilda discovers she is not her father's daughter etc etc....\n\n\n\nThe first half is by far the best...the boy Dick is played by a charismatic child actor he makes the first half. The second half of the series is lousy from the 2 dimensional rendition of war time England to just the way the screen writers condensed and parsed the novel--a common problem with book/movies.\n\n\n\nAnother problem for me was the Appalachian type sound track...it is incongruous to the location.\n\n\n\nThis is an over dramatized soap with below average production values. I blame the writers and a couple miscast characters.\n\n\n\nOne measure I have of soaps is if they make make me care about the characters... in the second half of this film I grew to dislike all of them.

It is the official language of Andorra, and an official language of three autonomous communities in eastern Spain: Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, where it is called Valencian (valencià). It has semi-official status in the Italian comune of Alghero,[3] and it is spoken in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France and in two further areas in eastern Spain: the eastern strip of Aragon and the Carche area in the Region of Murcia. The Catalan-speaking territories are often called the Països Catalans or \"Catalan Countries\".[4]\n\nThe language evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages around the eastern Pyrenees. Nineteenth-century Spain saw a Catalan literary revival, culminating in the early 1900s.\n\nThe word Catalan is derived from the territorial name of Catalonia, itself of disputed etymology. The main theory suggests that Catalunya (Latin: Gathia Launia) derives from the name Gothia or Gauthia ('Land of the Goths'), since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the March of Gothia, whence Gothland > Gothlandia > Gothalania > Catalonia theoretically derived.\n\nIn English, the term referring to a person first appears in the mid 14th century as Catelaner, followed in the 15th century as Catellain (from Middle French). It is attested a language name since at least 1652. The word Catalan can be pronounced in English as KAT-ə-lən, -⁠lan or KAT-ə-LAN.[9][10]\n\nThe endonym is pronounced [kətəˈla] in the Eastern Catalan dialects, and [kataˈla] in the Western dialects. In the Valencian Community and Carche, the term valencià [valensiˈa] is frequently used instead. Thus, the name \"Valencian\", although often employed for referring to the varieties specific to the Valencian Community and Carche, is also used by Valencians as a name for the language as a whole,[11] synonymous with \"Catalan\".[11] Both uses of the term have their respective entries in the dictionaries by the Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua (AVL)[note 1] and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC).[note 2] (See also status of Valencian below).\n\nBy the 9th century, Catalan had evolved from Vulgar Latin on both sides of the eastern end of the Pyrenees, as well as the territories of the Roman province of Hispania Tarraconensis to the south. From the 8th century onwards the Catalan counts extended their territory southwards and westwards at the expense of the Muslims, bringing their language with them. This process was given definitive impetus with the separation of the County of Barcelona from the Carolingian Empire in 988.\n\nIn the 11th century, documents written in macaronic Latin begin to show Catalan elements, with texts written almost completely in Romance appearing by 1080. Old Catalan shared many features with Gallo-Romance, diverging from Old Occitan between the 11th and 14th centuries.\n\nDuring the 11th and 12th centuries the Catalan rulers expanded southward to the Ebro river, and in the 13th century they conquered the lands that would become the Kingdoms of Valencia and the Majorca. The city of Alghero in Sardinia was repopulated with Catalan speakers in the 14th century. The language also reached Murcia, which became Spanish-speaking in the 15th century.\n\nIn the Low Middle Ages, Catalan went through a golden age, reaching a peak of maturity and cultural richness. Examples include the work of Majorcan polymath Ramon Llull (1232–1315), the Four Great Chronicles (13th–14th centuries), and the Valencian school of poetry culminating in Ausiàs March (1397–1459). By the 15th century, the city of Valencia had become the sociocultural center of the Crown of Aragon, and Catalan was present all over the Mediterranean world. During this period, the Royal Chancery propagated a highly standardized language. Catalan was widely used as an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th. During this period, the language was what Costa Carreras terms \"one of the 'great languages' of medieval Europe\".\n\nMartorell's novel of chivalry Tirant lo Blanc (1490) shows a transition from Medieval to Renaissance values, something that can also be seen in Metge's work. The first book produced with movable type in the Iberian Peninsula was printed in Catalan.[16]\n\nWith the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon in 1479, the Spanish kings ruled over different kingdoms, each with its own cultural, linguistic and political particularities, and they had to swear by the laws of each territory before the respective parliaments. But after the War of the Spanish Succession, Spain became an absolute monarchy under Philip V, which led to the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Nueva Planta decrees, as a first step in the creation of the Spanish nation-state; as in other contemporary European states, this meant the imposition of the political and cultural characteristics of the dominant groups.[18][19] Since the political unification of 1714, Spanish assimilation policies towards national minorities have been a constant.[20][21][22][23][24][neutrality is disputed]\n\nThe process of assimilation began with secret instructions to the corregidores of the Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed\".[25] From there, actions in the service of assimilation, discreet or aggressive, were continued, and reached to the last detail, such as, in 1799, the Royal Certificate forbidding anyone to \"represent, sing and dance pieces that were not in Spanish\".[25] The use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious and marked the start of the decline of Catalan. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature came under the influence of Spanish, and the nobles, part of the urban and literary classes became bilingual.\n\nWith the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), Spain ceded the northern part of Catalonia to France, and soon thereafter the local Catalan varieties came under the influence of French, which in 1700 became the sole official language of the region.[26]\n\nShortly after the French Revolution (1789), the French First Republic prohibited official use of, and enacted discriminating policies against, the regional languages of France, such as Catalan, Alsatian, Breton, Occitan, Flemish, and Basque.\n\nAfter the French colony of Algeria was established in 1830, many Catalan-speaking settlers moved there. People from the Spanish province of Alicante settled around Oran, while those from French Catalonia and Menorca migrated to Algiers.\n\nBy 1911, there were around 100,000 speakers of Patuet,[27] as their speech was called.[28] After the Algerian declaration of independence in 1962, almost all the Pied-Noir Catalan speakers fled to Northern Catalonia[29] or Alicante.\n\nThe French government only recognizes French as an official language. Nevertheless, on 10 December 2007, the then General Council of the Pyrénées-Orientales officially recognized Catalan as one of the départment's languages[31] and seeks to further promote it in public life and education.\n\nIn 1807, the Statistics Office of the French Ministry of the Interior asked the prefects for an official survey on the limits of the French language. The survey found that in Roussillon, almost only Catalan was spoken, and since Napoleon wanted to incorporate Catalonia into France, as happened in 1812, the consul in Barcelona was also asked. He declared that Catalan \"is taught in schools, it is printed and spoken, not only among the lower class, but also among people of first quality, also in social gatherings, as in visits and congresses\", indicating that it was spoken everywhere \"with the exception of the royal courts\". He also indicated that Catalan was spoken \"in the Kingdom of Valencia, in the islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, Sardinia, Corsica and much of Sicily, in the Vall d \"Aran and Cerdaña\".[32]\n\nThe defeat of the pro-Habsburg coalition in the War of Spanish Succession (1714) initiated a series of laws which, among other centralizing measures, imposed the use of Spanish in legal documentation all over Spain. Because of this, use of the Catalan language declined into the 18th century.\n\nHowever, the 19th century saw a Catalan literary revival (Renaixença), which has continued up to the present day. This period starts with Aribau's Ode to the Homeland (1833); followed in the second half of the 19th century, and the early 20th by the work of Verdaguer (poetry), Oller (realist novel), and Guimerà (drama). In the 19th century, the region of Carche, in the province of Murcia was repopulated with Valencian speakers. Catalan spelling was standardized in 1913 and the language became official during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). The Second Spanish Republic saw a brief period of tolerance, with most restrictions against Catalan lifted. The Generalitat (the autonomous government of Catalonia, established during the Republic in 1931) made a normal use of Catalan in its administration and put efforts to promote it at the social level, including in schools and the University of Barcelona.\n\nThe Catalan language and culture were still vibrant during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), but were crushed at an unprecedented level throughout the subsequent decades due to Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), which abolished the official status of Catalan and imposed the use of Spanish in schools and in public administration in all of Spain, while banning the use of Catalan in them.[35] Between 1939 and 1943 newspapers and book printing in Catalan almost disappeared.[36] Francisco Franco's desire for a homogeneous Spanish population resonated with some Catalans in favor of his regime, primarily members of the upper class, who began to reject the use of Catalan. Despite all of these hardships, Catalan continued to be used privately within households, and it was able to survive Franco's dictatorship. At the end of World War II, however, some of the harsh measures began to be lifted and, while Spanish language remained the sole promoted one, limited number of Catalan literature began to be tolerated. Several prominent Catalan authors resisted the suppression through literature.[37] Private initiative contests were created to reward works in Catalan, among them Joan Martorell prize (1947), Víctor Català prize (1953) Carles Riba award (1950), or the Honor Award of Catalan Letters (1969).[38] The first Catalan-language TV show was broadcast in 1964.[39] At the same time, oppression of the Catalan language and identity was carried out in schools, through governmental bodies, and in religious centers.[40]\n\nIn addition to the loss of prestige for Catalan and its prohibition in schools, migration during the 1950s into Catalonia from other parts of Spain also contributed to the diminished use of the language. These migrants were often unaware of the existence of Catalan, and thus felt no need to learn or use it. Catalonia was the economic powerhouse of Spain, so these migrations continued to occur from all corners of the country. Employment opportunities were reduced for those who were not bilingual.[41] Daily newspapers remained exclusively in Spanish until after Franco's death, when the first one in Catalan since the end of the Civil War, Avui, began to be published in 1976.[42]\n\nSince the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–1982), Catalan has been institutionalized as an official language, language of education, and language of mass media; all of which have contributed to its increased prestige. In Catalonia, there is an unparalleled large bilingual European non-state linguistic community. The teaching of Catalan is mandatory in all schools, but it is possible to use Spanish for studying in the public education system of Catalonia in two situations—if the teacher assigned to a class chooses to use Spanish, or during the learning process of one or more recently arrived immigrant students.[44] There is also some intergenerational shift towards Catalan.\n\nMore recently, several Spanish political forces have tried to increase the use of Spanish in the Catalan educational system.[45] As a result, in May 2022 the Spanish Supreme Court urged the Catalan regional government to enforce a measure by which 25% of all lessons must be taught in Spanish.[46]\n\nAccording to the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, in 2013 the Catalan language is the second most commonly used in Catalonia, after Spanish, as a native or self-defining language: 7% of the population self-identifies with both Catalan and Spanish equally, 36.4% with Catalan and 47.5% only Spanish.[47] In 2003 the same studies concluded no language preference for self-identification within the population above 15 years old: 5% self-identified with both languages, 44.3% with Catalan and 47.5% with Spanish.[48] To promote use of Catalan, the Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's official Autonomous government) spends part of its annual budget on the promotion of the use of Catalan in Catalonia and in other territories, with entities such as Consorci per a la Normalització Lingüística [ca; es] (Consortium for Linguistic Normalization).[49][50]\n\nIn Andorra, Catalan has always been the sole official language. Since the promulgation of the 1993 constitution, several policies favoring Catalan have been enforced, such as Catalan medium education.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several language shift processes currently taking place. In the Northern Catalonia area of France, Catalan has followed the same trend as the other minority languages of France, with most of its native speakers being 60 or older (as of 2004). Catalan is studied as a foreign language by 30% of the primary education students, and by 15% of the secondary. The cultural association La Bressola promotes a network of community-run schools engaged in Catalan language immersion programs.\n\nIn Alicante province, Catalan is being replaced by Spanish and in Alghero by Italian. There is also well ingrained diglossia in the Valencian Community, Ibiza, and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the Balearic islands.\n\nDuring the 20th century many Catalans emigrated or went into exile to Venezuela, Mexico, Cuba, Argentina, and other South American countries. They formed a large number of Catalan colonies that today continue to maintain the Catalan language.[51] They also founded many Catalan casals (associations).[52]\n\nOne classification of Catalan is given by Pèire Bèc:\n\nHowever, the ascription of Catalan to the Occitano-Romance branch of Gallo-Romance languages is not shared by all linguists and philologists, particularly among Spanish ones, such as Ramón Menéndez Pidal.\n\nCatalan bears varying degrees of similarity to the linguistic varieties subsumed under the cover term Occitan language (see also differences between Occitan and Catalan and Gallo-Romance languages). Thus, as it should be expected from closely related languages, Catalan today shares many traits with other Romance languages.\n\nSome include Catalan in Occitan, as the linguistic distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon dialect) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century[53] and still today remains its closest relative.[54]\n\nCatalan shares many traits with the other neighboring Romance languages (Occitan, French, Italian, Sardinian as well as Spanish and Portuguese among others). However, despite being spoken mostly on the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan has marked differences with the Iberian Romance group (Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and especially vocabulary; it shows instead its closest affinity with languages native to France and northern Italy, particularly Occitan and to a lesser extent Gallo-Romance (Franco-Provençal, French, Gallo-Italian).[58]\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, the lexical similarity between Catalan and other Romance languages is: 87% with Italian; 85% with Portuguese and Spanish; 76% with Ladin and Romansh; 75% with Sardinian; and 73% with Romanian.[1]\n\nDuring much of its history, and especially during the Francoist dictatorship (1939–1975), the Catalan language was ridiculed as a mere dialect of Spanish. This view, based on political and ideological considerations, has no linguistic validity. Spanish and Catalan have important differences in their sound systems, lexicon, and grammatical features, placing the language in features closer to Occitan (and French).\n\nThere is evidence that, at least from the 2nd century AD, the vocabulary and phonology of Roman Tarraconensis was different from the rest of Roman Hispania. Differentiation arose generally because Spanish, Asturian, and Galician-Portuguese share certain peripheral archaisms (Spanish hervir, Asturian and Portuguese ferver vs. Catalan bullir, Occitan bolir \"to boil\") and innovatory regionalisms (Spanish novillo, Asturian nuviellu vs. Catalan torell, Occitan taurèl \"bullock\"), while Catalan has a shared history with the Western Romance innovative core, especially Occitan.\n\nLike all Romance languages, Catalan has a handful of native words which are unique to it, or rare elsewhere. These include:\n• verbs: 'to fasten; transfix' > 'to compose, write up', > 'to combine, conjugate', > 'to wake; awaken', 'to thicken; crowd together' > 'to save, keep', > 'to miss, yearn, pine for', 'to investigate, track' > Old Catalan enagar 'to incite, induce', > Old Catalan ujar 'to exhaust, fatigue', > 'to appease, mollify', > 'to reject, refuse';\n\nThe Gothic superstrate produced different outcomes in Spanish and Catalan. For example, Catalan fang \"mud\" and rostir \"to roast\", of Germanic origin, contrast with Spanish lodo and asar, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan filosa \"spinning wheel\" and templa \"temple\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish rueca and sien, of Germanic origin.\n\nThe same happens with Arabic loanwords. Thus, Catalan alfàbia \"large earthenware jar\" and rajola \"tile\", of Arabic origin, contrast with Spanish tinaja and teja, of Latin origin; whereas Catalan oli \"oil\" and oliva \"olive\", of Latin origin, contrast with Spanish aceite and aceituna. However, the Arabic element is generally much more prevalent in Spanish.\n\nSituated between two large linguistic blocks (Iberian Romance and Gallo-Romance), Catalan has many unique lexical choices, such as enyorar \"to miss somebody\", apaivagar \"to calm somebody down\", and rebutjar \"reject\".\n\nTraditionally Catalan-speaking territories are sometimes called the Països Catalans (Catalan Countries), a denomination based on cultural affinity and common heritage, that has also had a subsequent political interpretation but no official status. Various interpretations of the term may include some or all of these regions.\n\nThe number of people known to be fluent in Catalan varies depending on the sources used. A 2004 study did not count the total number of speakers, but estimated a total of 9–9.5 million by matching the percentage of speakers to the population of each area where Catalan is spoken.[69] The web site of the Generalitat de Catalunya estimated that as of 2004 there were 9,118,882 speakers of Catalan.[70] These figures only reflect potential speakers; today it is the native language of only 35.6% of the Catalan population.[71] According to Ethnologue, Catalan had 4.1 million native speakers and 5.1 million second-language speakers in 2021.[1]\n\nAccording to a 2011 study the total number of Catalan speakers was over 9.8 million, with 5.9 million residing in Catalonia. More than half of them spoke Catalan as a second language, with native speakers being about 4.4 million of those (more than 2.8 in Catalonia).[72] Very few Catalan monoglots exist; virtually all of the Catalan speakers in Spain are bilingual speakers of Catalan and Spanish, with 99.7% of Catalan speakers in Catalonia able to speak Spanish and 99.9% able to understand it.[73]\n\nIn Roussillon, only a minority of French Catalans speak Catalan nowadays, with French being the majority language for the inhabitants after a continued process of language shift. According to a 2019 survey by the Catalan government, 31.5% of the inhabitants of Catalonia predominantly spoke Catalan at home whereas 52.7% spoke Spanish, 2.8% both Catalan and Spanish and 10.8% other languages.[74]\n\nSpanish was the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. According to 2013 census, Catalan was also very commonly spoken in the city of 1,501,262: it was understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% over the age of two could speak it (1,137,816), 79% could read it (1,246.555), and 53% could write it (835,080).[75] The share of Barcelona residents who could speak it (72.3%)[76] was lower than that of the overall Catalan population, of whom 81.2% over the age of 15 spoke the language. Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. An important social characteristic of the Catalan language is that all the areas where it is spoken are bilingual in practice: together with French in Roussillon, with Italian in Alghero, with Spanish and French in Andorra, and with Spanish in the rest of the territories.\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n\n(% of the population 15 years old and older).\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, other than Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician and Portuguese, but unlike French, Spanish, or Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n\nIn contrast to other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words, and these may end in a wide variety of consonants, including some consonant clusters. Additionally, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, which gives rise to an abundance of such couplets as amic (\"male friend\") vs. amiga (\"female friend\").\n\nCentral Catalan pronunciation is considered to be standard for the language. The descriptions below are mostly representative of this variety.[85] For the differences in pronunciation between the different dialects, see the section on pronunciation of dialects in this article.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, with the exception of Spanish. Balearic also has instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ, e/.\n\nIn Central Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. The other dialects have different vowel reduction processes (see the section pronunciation of dialects in this article).\n\nThe consonant system of Catalan is rather conservative.\n• has a velarized allophone in syllable coda position in most dialects. However, is velarized irrespective of position in Eastern dialects such as Majorcan and standard Eastern Catalan.\n• occurs in Balearic, Algherese, standard Valencian and some areas in southern Catalonia. It has merged with elsewhere.\n• Voiced stops become lenited to approximants in syllable onsets, after continuants: > , > , > . Exceptions include after lateral consonants, and after . In coda position, these sounds are realized as stops, 100 except in some Valencian dialects where they are lenited.\n• There is some confusion in the literature about the precise phonetic characteristics of , , , . Some sources describe them as \"postalveolar\". Others as \"back alveolo-palatal\", implying that the characters ⟨ ⟩ would be more accurate. However, in all literature only the characters for palato-alveolar affricates and fricatives are used, even when the same sources use ⟨ ⟩ for other languages such as Polish and Chinese. 104 105\n• The distribution of the two rhotics and closely parallels that of Spanish. Between vowels, the two contrast, but they are otherwise in complementary distribution: in the onset of the first syllable in a word, appears unless preceded by a consonant. Dialects vary in regards to rhotics in the coda with Western Catalan generally featuring and Central Catalan dialects featuring a weakly trilled unless it precedes a vowel-initial word in the same prosodic unit, in which case appears.\n• In careful speech, , , may be geminated. Geminated may also occur. Some analyze intervocalic as the result of gemination of a single rhotic phoneme. This is similar to the common analysis of Spanish and Portuguese rhotics. 108\n• Marked contrast of the vowel pairs and , as in other Western Romance languages, except Spanish and Sardinian.\n• Lenition of voiced stops as in Galician and Spanish.\n• Lack of diphthongization of Latin short , , as in Galician, Sardinian and Portuguese, and unlike French, Spanish and Italian.\n• Abundance of diphthongs containing , as in Galician and Portuguese.\n• Abundance of and occurring at the end of words, as for instance moll (\"wet\") and any (\"year\"), unlike Spanish, Portuguese or Italian.\n\nIn contrast with other Romance languages, Catalan has many monosyllabic words; and those ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters. Also, Catalan has final obstruent devoicing, thus featuring many couplets like amic ('male friend') vs. amiga ('female friend').\n\nCatalan sociolinguistics studies the situation of Catalan in the world and the different varieties that this language presents. It is a subdiscipline of Catalan philology and other affine studies and has as an objective to analyze the relation between the Catalan language, the speakers and the close reality (including the one of other languages in contact).\n• Variations of Catalan by class, gender, profession, age and level of studies\n• Relations between Catalan and Spanish or French\n• Perception on the language of Catalan speakers and non-speakers\n• Presence of Catalan in several fields: tagging, public function, media, professional sectors\n\nThe dialects of the Catalan language feature a relative uniformity, especially when compared to other Romance languages; both in terms of vocabulary, semantics, syntax, morphology, and phonology. Mutual intelligibility between dialects is very high, estimates ranging from 90% to 95%.[1] The only exception is the isolated idiosyncratic Algherese dialect.\n\nCatalan is split in two major dialectal blocks: Eastern and Western. The main difference lies in the treatment of unstressed a and e; which have merged to /ə/ in Eastern dialects, but which remain distinct as /a/ and /e/ in Western dialects. There are a few other differences in pronunciation, verbal morphology, and vocabulary.\n\nWestern Catalan comprises the two dialects of North-Western Catalan and Valencian; the Eastern block comprises four dialects: Central Catalan, Balearic, Roussillonese, and Algherese. Each dialect can be further subdivided in several subdialects. The terms \"Catalan\" and \"Valencian\" (respectively used in Catalonia and the Valencian Community) refer to two varieties of the same language.[116] There are two institutions regulating the two standard varieties, the Institute of Catalan Studies in Catalonia and the Valencian Academy of the Language in the Valencian Community.\n\nCentral Catalan is considered the standard pronunciation of the language and has the largest number of speakers. It is spoken in the densely populated regions of the Barcelona province, the eastern half of the province of Tarragona, and most of the province of Girona.\n\nCatalan has an inflectional grammar. Nouns have two genders (masculine, feminine), and two numbers (singular, plural). Pronouns additionally can have a neuter gender, and some are also inflected for case and politeness, and can be combined in very complex ways. Verbs are split in several paradigms and are inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and gender. In terms of pronunciation, Catalan has many words ending in a wide variety of consonants and some consonant clusters, in contrast with many other Romance languages.\n\nCatalan has inherited the typical vowel system of Vulgar Latin, with seven stressed phonemes: /a, ɛ, e, i, ɔ, o, u/, a common feature in Western Romance, except Spanish. Balearic has also instances of stressed /ə/. Dialects differ in the different degrees of vowel reduction, and the incidence of the pair /ɛ e/.\n\nIn Eastern Catalan (except Majorcan), unstressed vowels reduce to three: /a, e, ɛ/ > [ə]; /o, ɔ, u/ > [u]; /i/ remains distinct. There are a few instances of unreduced [e], [o] in some words. Algherese has lowered [ə] to [a].\n\nIn Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a, e, ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o, ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan.\n\nIn Western Catalan, unstressed vowels reduce to five: /e, ɛ/ > [e]; /o, ɔ/ > [o]; /a, u, i/ remain distinct. This reduction pattern, inherited from Proto-Romance, is also found in Italian and Portuguese. Some Western dialects present further reduction or vowel harmony in some cases.\n\nCentral, Western, and Balearic differ in the lexical incidence of stressed /e/ and /ɛ/. Usually, words with /ɛ/ in Central Catalan correspond to /ə/ in Balearic and /e/ in Western Catalan. Words with /e/ in Balearic almost always have /e/ in Central and Western Catalan as well.[vague] As a result, Central Catalan has a much higher incidence of /ɛ/.\n\nCatalan dialects are characterized by final-obstruent devoicing, lenition and voicing assimilation. Additionally, many dialects contrast two rhotics (/r, ɾ/) and two laterals ((/l, ʎ/).\n\nMost Catalan dialects are also renowned by the usage of dark l (i.e. velarization of /l/ → [ɫ]), which is especially noticeable in syllable final position, in comparison to neighbouring languages, such as Spanish, Italian and French (that lack this pronunciation).\n\nThere is dialectal variation in regard to:\n• The pronunciation and distribution of sibilants (with different results according to voicing and affrication vs. deaffrication).\n• While, arguably there are seven to eight sibilants in Standard Catalan and Standard Valencian, dialects like Central Valencian and Ribagorçan only have three or four.\n• The usage of the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme .\n• The pronunciation or not of yod ( ) in the digraph .\n• The elision and pronunciation of final rhotics (either or ).\n• The delateralization of the palatal lateral approximant ( ).\n• The alternation of lenition vs. fortition (such as in 'village, people' → vs. vs. vs. vs. ).\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -e in verbs of the 1st conjugation and -∅ in verbs of the 2nd and 3rd conjugations in most of the Valencian Community, or -o in all verb conjugations in the Northern Valencian Community and Western Catalonia.\n\nE.g. parle, tem, sent (Valencian); parlo, temo, sento (North-Western Catalan).\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the ending for 1st-person present indicative is -o, -i, or -∅ in all conjugations. \n\nE.g. parlo (Central), parl (Balearic), and parli (Northern), all meaning ('I speak').\n\nWestern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -isc/-esc, -ix, -ixen, -isca/-esca.\n\nEastern Catalan: In verbs, the inchoative endings are -eixo, -eix, -eixen, -eixi.\n\nWestern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, maintenance of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. hòmens 'men', jóvens 'youth'.\n\nEastern Catalan: In nouns and adjectives, loss of /n/ of medieval plurals in proparoxytone words.\n\nE.g. homes 'men', joves 'youth' (Ibicencan, however, follows the model of Western Catalan in this case[123]).\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nStandard Catalan, virtually accepted by all speakers, is mostly based on Eastern Catalan, which is the most widely used dialect. Nevertheless, the standards of the Valencian Community and the Balearics admit alternative forms, mostly traditional ones, which are not current in eastern Catalonia.\n\nThe most notable difference between both standards is some tonic ⟨e⟩ accentuation, for instance: francès, anglès (IEC) – francés, anglés (AVL). Nevertheless, AVL's standard keeps the grave accent ⟨è⟩, while pronouncing it as /e/ rather than /ɛ/, in some words such as: què ('what'), or València. Other divergences include the use of ⟨tl⟩ (AVL) in some words instead of ⟨tll⟩ like in ametla/ametlla ('almond'), espatla/espatlla ('back'), the use of elided demonstratives (este 'this', eixe 'that') in the same level as reinforced ones (aquest, aqueix) or the use of many verbal forms common in Valencian, and some of these common in the rest of Western Catalan too, such as subjunctive mood or inchoative conjugation in -ix- at the same level as -eix- or the priority use of -e morpheme in 1st person singular in present indicative (-ar verbs): jo compre instead of jo compro ('I buy').\n\nIn the Balearic Islands, IEC's standard is used but adapted for the Balearic dialect by the University of the Balearic Islands's philological section. In this way, for instance, IEC says it is correct writing cantam as much as cantem ('we sing'), but the university says that the priority form in the Balearic Islands must be cantam in all fields. Another feature of the Balearic standard is the non-ending in the 1st person singular present indicative: jo compr ('I buy'), jo tem ('I fear'), jo dorm ('I sleep').\n\nIn Alghero, the IEC has adapted its standard to the Algherese dialect. In this standard one can find, among other features: the definite article lo instead of el, special possessive pronouns and determinants la mia ('mine'), lo sou/la sua ('his/her'), lo tou/la tua ('yours'), and so on, the use of -v- /v/ in the imperfect tense in all conjugations: cantava, creixiva, llegiva; the use of many archaic words, usual words in Algherese: manco instead of menys ('less'), calqui u instead of algú ('someone'), qual/quala instead of quin/quina ('which'), and so on; and the adaptation of weak pronouns. In 1999, Catalan (Algherese dialect) was among the twelve minority languages officially recognized as Italy's \"historical linguistic minorities\" by the Italian State under Law No. 482/1999.[125]\n\nIn 2011,[126] the Aragonese government passed a decree approving the statutes of a new language regulator of Catalan in La Franja (the so-called Catalan-speaking areas of Aragon) as originally provided for by Law 10/2009.[127] The new entity, designated as Institut Aragonès del Català, shall allow a facultative education in Catalan and a standardization of the Catalan language in La Franja.\n\nValencian is classified as a Western dialect, along with the North-Western varieties spoken in Western Catalonia (provinces of Lleida and the western half of Tarragona). Central Catalan has 90% to 95% inherent intelligibility for speakers of Valencian.[1]\n\nLinguists, including Valencian scholars, deal with Catalan and Valencian as the same language. The official regulating body of the language of the Valencian Community, the Valencian Academy of Language (Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua, AVL) declares the linguistic unity between Valencian and Catalan varieties.[11]\n\nThe AVL, created by the Valencian parliament, is in charge of dictating the official rules governing the use of Valencian, and its standard is based on the Norms of Castelló (Normes de Castelló). Currently, everyone who writes in Valencian uses this standard, except the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses an independent standard for Valencian.\n\nDespite the position of the official organizations, an opinion poll carried out between 2001 and 2004[129] showed that the majority of the Valencian people consider Valencian different from Catalan. This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly. Furthermore, the data indicates that younger generations educated in Valencian are much less likely to hold these views. A minority of Valencian scholars active in fields other than linguistics defends the position of the Royal Academy of Valencian Culture (Real Acadèmia de Cultura Valenciana, RACV), which uses for Valencian a standard independent from Catalan.[130]\n\nThis clash of opinions has sparked much controversy. For example, during the drafting of the European Constitution in 2004, the Spanish government supplied the EU with translations of the text into Basque, Galician, Catalan, and Valencian, but the latter two were identical.[131]\n\nDespite its relative lexical unity, the two dialectal blocks of Catalan (Eastern and Western) show some differences in word choices. Any lexical divergence within any of the two groups can be explained as an archaism. Also, usually Central Catalan acts as an innovative element.\n\nLiterary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there has been a tendency towards favoring words of Northern dialects to the detriment of others.\n\nLike other languages, Catalan has a large list of loanwords from Greek and Latin. This process started very early, and one can find such examples in Ramon Llull's work. In the 14th and 15th centuries Catalan had a far greater number of Greco-Latin loanwords than other Romance languages, as is attested for example in Roís de Corella's writings. The incorporation of learned, or \"bookish\" words from its own ancestor language, Latin, into Catalan is arguably another form of lexical borrowing through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, most literate Catalan speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin words into their writing—and eventually speech—in Catalan.\n\nThe process of morphological derivation in Catalan follows the same principles as the other Romance languages, where inflection is common. Many times, several affixes are appended to a preexisting lexeme, and some sound alternations can occur, for example elèctric [əˈlɛktri ] (\"electrical\") vs. electricitat [ələktri iˈtat]. Prefixes are usually appended to verbs, as in preveure (\"foresee\").\n\nThere is greater regularity in the process of word-compounding, where one can find compounded words formed much like those in English.\n\nCatalan uses the Latin script, with some added symbols and digraphs. The Catalan orthography is systematic and largely phonologically based. Standardization of Catalan was among the topics discussed during the First International Congress of the Catalan Language, held in Barcelona October 1906. Subsequently, the Philological Section of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC, founded in 1911) published the Normes ortogràfiques in 1913 under the direction of Antoni Maria Alcover and Pompeu Fabra. In 1932, Valencian writers and intellectuals gathered in Castelló de la Plana to make a formal adoption of the so-called Normes de Castelló, a set of guidelines following Pompeu Fabra's Catalan language norms.[134]\n\nThe grammar of Catalan is similar to other Romance languages. Features include:\n• Use of definite and indefinite articles.\n• Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are inflected for gender (masculine and feminine), and number (singular and plural). There is no case inflexion, except in pronouns.\n• Verbs are highly inflected for person, number, tense, aspect, and mood (including a subjunctive).\n• There are no modal auxiliaries.\n• Word order is freer than in English.\n\nIn gender inflection, the most notable feature is (compared to Portuguese, Spanish or Italian), the loss of the typical masculine suffix -o. Thus, the alternance of -o/-a, has been replaced by ø/-a. There are only a few exceptions, such as minso/minsa (\"scarce\"). Many not completely predictable morphological alternations may occur, such as:\n• Loss of : / (\"flat\") vs. / (\"second\")\n\nCatalan has few suppletive couplets, like Italian and Spanish, and unlike French. Thus, Catalan has noi/noia (\"boy\"/\"girl\") and gall/gallina (\"cock\"/\"hen\"), whereas French has garçon/fille and coq/poule.\n\nThere is a tendency to abandon traditionally gender-invariable adjectives in favor of marked ones, something prevalent in Occitan and French. Thus, one can find bullent/bullenta (\"boiling\") in contrast with traditional bullent/bullent.\n\nAs in the other Western Romance languages, the main plural expression is the suffix -s, which may create morphological alternations similar to the ones found in gender inflection, albeit more rarely. The most important one is the addition of -o- before certain consonant groups, a phonetic phenomenon that does not affect feminine forms: el pols/els polsos (\"the pulse\"/\"the pulses\") vs. la pols/les pols (\"the dust\"/\"the dusts\").\n\nThe inflection of determinatives is complex, specially because of the high number of elisions, but is similar to the neighboring languages. Catalan has more contractions of preposition + article than Spanish, such as dels (\"of + the [plural]\"), but not as many as Italian (which has sul, col, nel, etc.).\n\nCentral Catalan has abandoned almost completely unstressed possessives (mon, etc.) in favor of constructions of article + stressed forms (el meu, etc.), a feature shared with Italian.\n\nThe morphology of Catalan personal pronouns is complex, especially in unstressed forms, which are numerous (13 distinct forms, compared to 11 in Spanish or 9 in Italian). Features include the gender-neutral ho and the great degree of freedom when combining different unstressed pronouns (65 combinations).\n\nCatalan pronouns exhibit T–V distinction, like all other Romance languages (and most European languages, but not Modern English). This feature implies the use of a different set of second person pronouns for formality.\n\nThis flexibility allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, much more than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren (\"they recommended me to him\"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use so often the passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).\n\nLike all the Romance languages, Catalan verbal inflection is more complex than the nominal. Suffixation is omnipresent, whereas morphological alternations play a secondary role. Vowel alternances are active, as well as infixation and suppletion. However, these are not as productive as in Spanish, and are mostly restricted to irregular verbs.\n\nThe Catalan verbal system is basically common to all Western Romance, except that most dialects have replaced the synthetic indicative perfect with a periphrastic form of anar (\"to go\") + infinitive.\n\nCatalan verbs are traditionally divided into three conjugations, with vowel themes -a-, -e-, -i-, the last two being split into two subtypes. However, this division is mostly theoretical. Only the first conjugation is nowadays productive (with about 3500 common verbs), whereas the third (the subtype of servir, with about 700 common verbs) is semiproductive. The verbs of the second conjugation are fewer than 100, and it is not possible to create new ones, except by compounding.\n\nThe grammar of Catalan follows the general pattern of Western Romance languages. The primary word order is subject–verb–object.[142] However, word order is very flexible. Commonly, verb-subject constructions are used to achieve a semantic effect. The sentence \"The train has arrived\" could be translated as Ha arribat el tren or El tren ha arribat. Both sentences mean \"the train has arrived\", but the former puts a focus on the train, while the latter puts a focus on the arrival. This subtle distinction is described as \"what you might say while waiting in the station\" versus \"what you might say on the train\".\n\nIn Spain, every person officially has two surnames, one of which is the father's first surname and the other is the mother's first surname. The law contemplates the possibility of joining both surnames with the Catalan conjunction i (\"and\").[145]\n\nSelected text from Manuel de Pedrolo's 1970 novel Un amor fora ciutat (\"A love affair outside the city\").\n• Gramàtica Normativa Valenciana (Valencian grammar).

Thanks to these dunes the island of Formentera is a natural paradise that is unique in the entire Mediterranean.\n\nThe northern end of Formentera is home to the Ses Illetes beach and the nearby islet of S’Espalmador. These are captivating extensions of pinkish sand formed into a string of coastal dunes. These dunes are highly valuable in ecological terms, thanks to the specific plants, such as the juniper, and the specialised fauna that live there. These dunes often act as natural barriers, protecting the salt marshes.\n\nBoth Ses Illetes and S’Espalmador are part of the Parque Natural de las Salinas de Ibiza y Formentera, a natural 15.000-hectare site that protects southern Ibiza and northern Formentera.\n\nS’Espalmador is an idyllic islet close to the Ses Illetes beach, with crystal-clear water and covered in a forest of pine trees and junipers, which you can reach even on foot, as the narrow stretch of water that separates it from the rest of Formentera is quite shallow. It offers one of the best-preserved and most amazing beaches, with a thousand metres of fine sand the s’Alga beach is a visual delight for visitors. This makes it one of the most attractive places on the whole island.\n\nSes Illetes is a well-known sandy beach that is one and a half kilometres long, but in many sections only 50 metres wide. This lets you bathe in “two seas”, to the east and to the west, although both have crystalline water and only a short distance from the sand both have valuable prairies of Posidonia oceánica (seagrass) that have been declared World Heritage by the Unesco.Hostal Illes Pitiüses | Formentera Passport: Esta habitación dispone de aire acondicionado, caja fuerte, TV y balcón privado.

It is 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the city of Valencia. It is the third largest of the Balearic Islands in area, but the second-largest by population. Its largest settlements are Ibiza Town (Catalan: Vila d'Eivissa, or simply Vila), Santa Eulària des Riu, and Sant Antoni de Portmany. Its highest point, called Sa Talaiassa (or Sa Talaia), is 475 metres (1,558 feet) above sea level.\n\nIbiza is well known for its nightlife and electronic dance music club scene in the summer, which attract large numbers of tourists. The island's government and the Spanish Tourist Office have worked toward promoting more family-oriented tourism.[2][3]\n\nIbiza is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[4] Ibiza and the nearby island of Formentera to its south are called the Pine Islands, or \"Pityuses\".\n\nIn British English, the name is usually pronounced in an approximation of the Peninsular Spanish variant ( ib-EE-thə).[5] In American English, the pronunciation is closer to the Latin American Spanish variant ( ib-EE-zə,[6] ee-BEE-sə,[7][8][9] and so forth) and the first syllable is never pronounced as a homophone of \"eye\".\n\nPhoenician colonists called the island Ibossim, likely due the abundance of aromatic plants on the island. Other speculation is (Phoenician: 𐤀𐤉𐤁𐤔𐤌, ʾYBŠM, \"Dedicated to Bes\").[11][12] It was later known to Romans as Ebusus.\n\nThe Greeks called the two islands of Ibiza and Formentera the Pityoûssai (Πιτυοῦσσαι, probably meaning \"Pine-Covered Islands\").[13] The Catalan name Pitiüses and the Spanish name Pitiusas retain this Greek root.\n\nIts name in Catalan is Eivissa ( pronounced [əjˈvisə]). The Spanish name is Ibiza ( pronounced [iˈβiθa] in Spain / [iˈβisa] in Latin America).\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries the island was known to the British and especially to the Royal Navy as Ivica, possibly from an older Spanish orthography with ⟨ç⟩.[14]\n\nIn 654 BC, Phoenician settlers founded a port on Ibiza. With the decline of Phoenicia after the Assyrian invasions, Ibiza came under the control of Carthage, also a former Phoenician colony. The island produced dye, salt, fish sauce (garum) and wool.\n\nA shrine with offerings to the goddess Tanit was established in the cave at Es Cuieram, and the rest of the Balearic Islands entered Eivissa's commercial orbit after 400 BC. Ibiza was a major trading post along the Mediterranean routes. Ibiza began establishing its own trading stations along the nearby Balearic island of Mallorca (Majorca), such as Na Guardis, and \"Na Galera\" where numerous Balearic mercenaries hired on, no doubt as slingers,[a] to fight for Carthage.\n\nDuring the Second Punic War, the island was assaulted by the two Scipio brothers (Publius and Gnaeus) in 217 BC but remained loyal to Carthage. With the Carthaginian military failing on the Iberian mainland, Ibiza was last used, 205 B.C, by the fleeing Carthaginian general Mago to gather supplies and men before sailing to Menorca and then to Liguria. Ibiza negotiated a favorable treaty (Foedus) with the Romans, which spared Ibiza from further destruction and allowed it to continue its Carthaginian-Punic institutions, traditions and even coinage well into the Empire days, when it became an official Roman municipality.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire and a brief period of first Vandal and then Byzantine rule, the island was conquered by the Muslims in 902. The few remaining locals converted to Islam and Berber settlers came in. Under Islamic rule, Ibiza (Yabisah) came in close contact with the city of Dénia—the closest port in the nearby Iberian peninsula, located in the Valencian Community—and the two areas were administered jointly by the Taifa of Dénia for some time (11th century).\n\nIbiza, together with the islands of Formentera and Menorca, were invaded by the Norwegian King Sigurd I of Norway in the spring of 1110 on his crusade to Jerusalem. The king had previously conquered the cities of Sintra, Lisbon and Alcácer do Sal and given them over to Christian rulers, in an effort to weaken the Muslim grip on the Iberian peninsula. King Sigurd continued to Sicily where he visited King Roger II of Sicily.[16]\n\nThe island was conquered for the Crown of Aragon in 1235.[17] The local Muslim population was deported, as was the case with neighboring Mallorca and elsewhere, and Christians arrived from Girona. The island maintained its own self-government in several forms until 1715, when King Philip V of Spain abolished the local government's autonomy. The arrival of democracy in the late 1970s led to the Statute of Autonomy of the Balearic Islands. Today, the island is part of the Balearic Autonomous Community, along with Mallorca, Menorca and Formentera.\n\nThough primarily known for its party scene, large portions of the island are registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[18]\n\nA notable example includes the Renaissance walls of the old town of Ibiza City, which were awarded UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1999. They are one of the world's few Renaissance walls that were not demolished, and part of the medieval wall is still visible. There are some Ibizan cultural sites, such as the remains of the first Phoenician settlement at Sa Caleta. Other sites are still under threat from the developers, such as Ses Feixes Wetlands, but this site has now been recognised as a threatened environment, and it is expected that steps will be taken to preserve this wetland. The oceanic plant Posidonia oceanica is also part of UNESCO's World Heritage.\n• Penjats Island is the southernmost islet of Ibiza\n\nIbiza is a rock island covering an area of 572.56 square kilometres (221.07 sq mi), almost one-sixth the size of Mallorca, but over five times larger than Mykonos in the Greek Isles, or 10 times larger than Manhattan in New York City.\n\nIbiza is the larger of a group of the western Balearic archipelago called the Pityusic Islands (Pitiusas) or \"Pine Islands\" composed of itself and Formentera. The Balearic island chain includes over 50 islands, many of which are uninhabited. The highest point of the island is Sa Talaiassa, also known as Sa Talaia or Sa Talaia de Sant Josep at 475 metres (1,558 ft).\n\nIbiza is administratively part of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands, whose capital is Palma, on the island of Mallorca. Ibiza comprises five of the region's 67 municipalities:\n\nAt the 2001 census these municipalities had a total population of 88,076 inhabitants, which had risen to an officially estimated total of 159,180 at the start of 2023,[20] and have a land area of 572.56 km2 (221.07 sq mi).\n\nThe island's self-government institution is the Ibiza Island Council (Consell Insular d'Eivissa). Prior to its split in 2007, Formentera was part of the council.[21]\n\nElections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituencies of Ibiza and Formentera (then forming a single Island council, with Ibiza sending 12 councilors and Formentera a single one). Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Island Council of Ibiza, which has kept 13 as the number of seats (despite sending 12 to the Balearic Parliament).\n\nIbiza has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: BSh). The average annual temperature of Ibiza is 18.3 °C (65 °F), being warm and mild throughout the whole year. Ibiza lies at the same latitude as Atlantic City, yet it is much warmer for its location in the Mediterranean Basin. The climate of Ibiza is typically warm, sunny and dry, with low variation between highs and lows. The sunshine hours of Ibiza are 2700-2800 per year, while the yearly rain amount ranges from 400 to 450 millimetres (16 to 18 in). The average high temperature is 22.3 °C (72 °F), while the average low is 14.2 °C (58 °F). Winters are slightly rainy and mild, from November to April normally the whole island turns green for the seasonal rains. Summers are hot and fairly humid, which contributes to high dew points and muggy weather, increasing the heat index, although with very little rainfall. The few rainy days are often accompanied by thunderstorms. During the coldest month, January, the average high temperature is 15.8 °C (60 °F), while the average low is 7.9 °C (46 °F). In the warmest month, August, the average high temperature is 30.4 °C (87 °F), while the low is 22.2 °C (72 °F). Extreme temperatures are rare for the influence of the sea. The average temperature of the sea in Ibiza is 19.7 °C (67 °F)[23] and beach weather usually lasts 7 months, from May to November. The highest temperature ever recorded on Ibiza Airport is 41 °C (106 °F) on 13 August 2022.\n\nDemographically, Ibiza displays a very peculiar configuration, as census agencies diverge on exact figures. According to the 2001 national census, Ibiza had 88,076 inhabitants (against 76,000 in 1991, 64,000 in 1981, 45,000 in 1971, and 38,000 in 1961). However, by the 2011 national census, this had grown to 133,594, and at the Census of 2021 had reached 154,186. This rapid growth stems from the amnesty which incorporated a number of unregistered foreign migrants. In terms of origin, about 55 percent of island residents were born in Ibiza; 35 percent are domestic migrants from mainland Spain (mostly working-class families from Andalusia, and the remainder from Catalonia, Valencia and Castile); and the remaining 10 to 15 per cent are foreign, dual and multi-national citizens of the EU and abroad (Govern de les Illes Balears – IBAE 1996). In decreasing order, the most commonly visiting foreigners are German, British, Latin American, French, Italian and Dutch.\n\nThe Spanish composer and music theorist Miguel Roig-Francolí was born in Ibiza,[29] as was the politician and Spain's former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abel Matutes.[30] Notable former residents of Ibiza include: Spandau Ballet's Steve Norman, English punk musician Sid Vicious,[31] comic actor Terry-Thomas,[32] Hungarian master forger Elmyr de Hory,[33] American authors Cormac McCarthy and Clifford Irving.[34]\n\nEivissenc is the native dialect of Catalan that is spoken on Ibiza and nearby Formentera. Catalan shares co-official status with Spanish. Additionally, because of the influence of tourism and immigrants living in or maintaining residences on the island, other languages, such as English, French, German and Italian, are widely spoken.[35]\n\nIbiza is considered to be a popular tourist destination, especially due to its well-known and at times riotous nightclub-based nightlife centred on two areas: Ibiza Town, the island's capital on the southern shore, and Sant Antoni to the west. Ibiza has garnered the reputation as the \"Party Capital of the world\".[36][37]\n\nNightlife in Ibiza has undergone several changes since the island's opening to international tourism in the late 1950s. Origins of today's club culture may be traced back to hippie gatherings held during the 1960s and 1970s.[citation needed] During these, people of various nationalities sharing the hippie ethos would regroup, talk, play music and occasionally take recreational drugs. These would most often happen on beaches during the day, with nude bathing a common sight, and in rented country estates in the evenings or at nights. Apart from this confidential scene, which nevertheless attracted many foreigners to the island, local venues during the 1960s consisted mostly of bars, which would be the meeting points for Ibicencos, ex-pats, seafarers and tourists. The Estrella bar on the port and La Tierra in the old city of Eivissa were favourites.[38]\n\nDuring the 1970s, a decade that saw the emergence of the contemporary nightclub, several venues opened and made a lasting impact on Ibiza's nightlife.[citation needed] Three of these original clubs are still in operation today: Pacha, Amnesia and Es Paradís.[clarification needed] These four clubs mainly defined nightlife on the White Island, which has evolved and developed from several distinctive elements: open-air parties (Es Paradis, Privilege, Amnesia), held in isolated places, eventually old fincas (Pacha, Amnesia), that mixed in nudity and costume party (Es Paradis, Privilege, Pacha) and enabled people from various backgrounds to blend (all). The hippie ethos served as a common factor that infused all these venues and catalyzed the experience of a certain kind of freedom, accentuated by the holiday nature of most of the stays on the White Island.[citation needed]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the music played in these clubs gained in reputation and became known as Balearic beat, a precursor of the British acid house scene. As rave parties blossomed all over Europe, a DJ-driven club culture took hold of Ibizenca nightlife. It was at that time that Space opened, thanks to Pepe Rosello, which found a niche in the after-hour parties.[39] The club would close at 18:00 and open again at 07:00, when all the other clubs were still closed, enabling party-goers to flock from the other clubs to Space and continue dancing in broad daylight.[39]\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, the after-hour parties took firm root on the island. In 1999, the Circoloco parties made their debut at DC10, with some of the original elements of Ibiza nightlife at the forefront.[citation needed]\n\nIn recent years, during the summer, top producers and DJs in dance music come to the island and play at the various clubs, in between touring to other international destinations. Some of the most famous DJs run their own weekly nights around the island. Many of these DJs use Ibiza as an outlet for presenting new songs within the house, trance and techno genres of electronic dance music. The island has achieved fame as a cultural centre for house and trance in particular, with its name often being used as a partial metonym for the particular flavour of electronic music originating there, much like Goa in India.[citation needed]\n\nSince 2005, the live music event Ibiza Rocks has changed perceptions of the Ibiza party landscape.[40] Bands such as Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, The Prodigy and the Kaiser Chiefs have played in the courtyard of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel.[41]\n\nThe season now traditionally begins at the end of April, where Opening Parties take place at Ibiza's clubs over the course of a three-week period. Opening Parties normally coincide with the culmination of the International Music Summit, a three-day conference promoting the electronic music industry, featuring speakers, masterclasses and performances, and co-hosted by Pete Tong and Jaguar. IMS has taken place on the island annually since 2007 and holds its closing party at the top of Dalt Vila.[42][43] The first clubs that host opening parties are normally Ushuaïa, Hï, Amnesia, and Pacha.[44] The first parties take place at the end of April, starting with the Hï and Ushuaïa Opening Parties, and the last parties occur around mid-October, usually being the Amnesia and Pacha Closing Parties.[45] Ibiza has recently won numerous awards globally for its world class nightlife venues.[46] The new super clubs including Hi and Ushuaïa, are two of the most notable as of 2024.[47]\n\nThe island's government is in the process of making policy changes[when?] to encourage a more family-friendly and quieter tourism scene. These include rules such as the closing of all nightclubs by 06:00 at the latest and requiring all new hotels to be 5-star.[48] The administration wants to attract a more international mixture of tourists.[49][clarification needed][needs update]\n\nThe island's tourism is not always characterized by its nightlife. Visitors can take a hot-air balloon ride, surf, visit the Cave Can Mark, or go to Cap Blanc's Aquarium.[50]\n\nSince the early days of mass tourism on the island, there have been a large number of development projects ranging from successful ventures, such as the super clubs at Space and Privilege, to failed development projects, such as Josep Lluís Sert's abandoned hotel complex at Cala D'en Serra,[51] the half-completed and now demolished \"Idea\" nightclub in Sant Antoni,[52] and the ruins of a huge restaurant/nightclub in the hills near Sant Josep called \"Festival Club\" that only operated for three summer seasons in the early 1970s.[53] The transient nature of club-oriented tourism is most obvious in these ruins scattered all over the island. Local artist Irene de Andrès has tackled the difficult issue of the impact of mass tourism on the island local landscapes, both natural and cultural, in an ongoing project called \"Donde nada ocurre\" (Where nothing happens).[54] In 2013, Ibiza property prices generally remained above market value, and many of the development projects on the island have now been completed or continue, as well as some new projects announced at the end of 2012. Since 2009, Ibiza has received an increase in the number of tourists every year, with nearly 6 million people travelling through Ibiza Airport in 2012. The summer season has become concentrated between June and September, focusing on the \"clubbing calendar\"[55] which is currently booming. In recent years, the luxury market has dramatically improved, with new restaurants, clubs, and improvements to the marina in Ibiza Town.[56]\n\nIbiza's increased popularity has led to problems with potable water shortages and overrun infrastructure.[57] This has led to the imposition of a \"Sustainable Tourism Tax\" which went into effect on 1 July 2016.[58] Minister of Tourism Vincente Torres stated in an interview in 2016 that the government has instituted a moratorium on building in certain areas. He said that with almost 100,000 legal tourist beds and about 132,000 inhabitants on the island's 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi), not much more tourism can be supported.[58]\n\nIbiza has its own airport, which has many international flights during the summer tourist season, especially from the European Union and the United Kingdom.\n\nThere are also ferries from the harbour of Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town to Barcelona, Mallorca, Dénia, and Valencia. There are also ferries to Formentera leaving Sant Antoni Harbour (normally every Wednesday), and daily from Ibiza Town, Santa Eulària, and Figueretes–Platja d'en Bossa.[59]\n\nSeveral public buses also travel between Sant Antoni and Ibiza Town, every 15 minutes in summer and every half-hour in winter. In addition, there are buses from Sant Antoni to Cala Bassa, Cala Conta and Cala Tarida, and to the airport. From Ibiza there are buses to the Platja d'en Bossa, Ses Salines, the airport and Santa Eulària.[60] The late night bus line that stops at the various clubs is locally known as the Disco Bus.[61]\n\nA number of novels and other books have been written using Ibiza as the setting, including: \"The Life Impossible\" by Matt Haig, \"The Canticle of Ibiza\" by Justin Kurian, \"The White Island\" by Stephen Armstrong, Joshua Then and Now by Mordecai Richler, Soma Blues by Robert Sheckley,[62] Vacation in Ibiza by Lawrence Schimel,[63] A Short Life on a Sunny Isle: An Alphonse Dantan Mystery by Hannah Blank,[64] They Are Ruining Ibiza by A. C. Greene,[65] and The Python Project by Victor Canning.[66] Books including Ibiza Bohemia,[67] which was published by Assouline, have explored the island itself with both photography and text, while other such as Memes Eivissencs have registered the traditions of their residents and their history in social media.\n\nThe third track on Prefab Sprout's 1990 album Jordan: The Comeback is 'Machine Gun Ibiza'.[68] It is also mentioned in David Bowie's 1971 track 'Life on Mars?', \"See the mice in their million hordes, from Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads.\"[69]\n\nIn Monty Python's Flying Circus, the opening sketch of Episode 33 features the pilot Biggles. His secretary teasingly calls him \"Señor Biggles\", and Biggles protests, saying, \"I've never even been to Spain.\" The secretary responds, \" You went to Ibiza last year.\" Biggles counters, \"That's still not grounds for calling me señor, or Don Beeg-les for that matter.\"[70]\n\nWham's 1983 hit single \"Club Tropicana\" music video was filmed in Ibiza. It was the first time George Michael & Andrew Ridgeley would leave the UK.\n\nVengaboys' 1999 single \"We're Going to Ibiza\" reached number one on the singles chart in United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The song saw a resurgence in Austria in 2019 due to the Ibiza affair.\n\nThe island is shown as the home of notorious art forger, Elmyr de Hory, in the 1973 docudrama F for Fake by Orson Welles.\n\nThe fourth track off of The Prodigy’s sixth studio album The Day Is My Enemy is titled Ibiza. The song has fast rapping and electronic beats. The rapping is performed by the band’s frontman Keith Flint (died 2019).\n\nIn popular music, American singer-songwriter Mike Posner released \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (alternatively known as \"In Ibiza\", or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") in April 2015, as single on his Vevo account and in the exclusive The Truth EP; it was later released on At Night, Alone in May 2016. Originally an acoustic guitar-based folk pop song, it was remixed by the Norwegian duo SeeB as a tropical house dance pop song, and released digitally as a single in the United States on 24 July 2015. \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S.,[71] and reached #1 on seventeen other charts. Tourism officials in Ibiza were reportedly \"annoyed\" by the song's apparent reinforcement of drug culture associated with Ibiza in the past, and Tourism Director Vicent Ferrer subsequently invited Posner to witness the island's culture and how it contrasts with the party \"typecast\".[72]Dinner Plate Eivissa, Casafina by COSTA NOVA: The Salad Plate, made from fine stoneware and crafted in Portugal, features organic shapes and a reactive glaze, making each piece unique.The reactive glaze, applied during the firing process, creates exclusive patterns and tones in each piece.

The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. As modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they sit as members of Parliament.\n\nThe office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons.[4] In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security,[5]: p.22 and Minister for the Union.[6] The prime minister's official residence and office, by virtue of being the First Lord of the Treasury, is 10 Downing Street in London.[7]\n\nEarly conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the \"Primus inter pares\" or \"first among equals\", however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate.[8] The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment.[9][10] The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decide on key policies that fit their agenda which is then passed by an act of parliament.[11]\n\nThe power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power itself evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century.[12] During the premierships of Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher, prime ministerial power expanded substantially and their leadership in the office were described as \"presidential\" due to their personal yielding of power and tight control over the cabinet.[13][14][15] The prime minister is regarded as one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times.[16] As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister hold significant domestic and international leadership alongside being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.[17][18]\n\n58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. The current prime minister is Keir Starmer, who succeeded Rishi Sunak on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.[19]\n\nThe position of prime minister was not created but evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history.\n\nAfter a series of bills passed by the House of Commons, such as the Bill of Rights in 1689, the powers of the monarch were reduced, being replaced by the powers of parliament. [20]\n\nThe head of Treasury, as Lord Treasurer, was give the power in 1706 following Standing Order Number 66 to draft money bills (budgets) instead of MPs outside of government. The informal term of 'Prime Minister' was first recorded around that time, which since 1721 had mostly also been the office holder for the First Lord of the Treasury.\n\nSir Robert Walpole was the first Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, though his predecessors as First Lord of the Treasury also held a similar position. [21]\n\nThe role of Prime Minister grew more distinct as the head of government and often more recognisable within the public than other members of the cabinet, which demonstrates the increasing power of the Prime Minister in modern times than that originally created. [22]\n\nThe prime minister is the head of the United Kingdom government.[23] As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons (the lower chamber of Parliament). The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation.[24] Walter Bagehot described the office of prime minister as the \"keystone of the Cabinet arch\" that maintained while the prime minister can hold significant power over the executive, it is often exercised collectively through the Cabinet (Government).\n\nMinisterial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister's executive authority. The prime minister leads the cabinet which makes the holder of that office bear responsibility for the collective conduct of the government. Professor Rodney Brazier points out that the since the prime minister wields significant sway over policy, that power must be subjected to the conclusion and input of Cabinet ministers. This prevents the office of prime minister from becoming more dominant and also ensures that executive power is authorised with broader support from and within the government. The prime minister must constantly maintain the confidence of the House of Commons because, as Bagehot notes, the power of the prime minister derives from their ability to command a majority in the House in order to pass legislation and continue the functions of government. If a prime minister loses the confidence of the House, which occurs in a vote of no confidence, they are often expected to resign from office or request the monarch dissolve parliament to call a general election.\n\nThe prime minister acts as the principal advisor to the monarch, who is the head of state, a capacity that has evolved gradually during the history of the office. Bagehot says that despite the monarch holding certain theoretical executive powers, in practice, these powers are often executed upon the advice and recommendation of the prime minister and the cabinet. This is considered a major principle of the \"unity of powers\" that exists within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch \"reigns but does not rule\". According to Brazier, the prime minister advises the monarch on matters such as the dissolution of parliament and appointments to the House of Lords, but these decisions are often made with the consent of parliament.\n\nThe prime minister leads the executive in directing government policy and maintaining coordination between government departments which is dependent upon the cooperation and consent of ministers. Foreign policy and national security are areas in which the prime minister has traditionally enjoyed more authority under what are known as prerogative powers. Vernon Bogdanor argues that the abilities to declare war, negotiate treaties and deploy the armed forces have historically been part of the monarch's royal authority but have slowly evolved into a function of the office of prime minister. Despite this, the exercise of the prime minister's prerogative powers in these matters is under the oversight of parliament. It is often by convention that a prime minister must seek the approval of parliament before committing the nation to military action. In addition to this, the prime minister also exerts informal influence over public policy. Brazier notes this is due to the prime minister often being the leader of the largest party in government, therefore having a direct impact in initiating policy both in government and during election campaigns.\n\nIn the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party. In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints (and may dismiss) all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service. The prime minister also acts as the public \"face\" and \"voice\" of His Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad. Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.[32]\n\nBagehot identifies the prime minister as the leader of the \"efficient\" part of government that functions within the government to steer legislation through both Houses of Parliament. Although the prime minister does not possess the power to introduce legislation directly, their control of the cabinet and their role as leader of the largest political party in the House of Commons enables them substantial influence over any legislative agenda. Bagehot points out that this power is based on the prime minister's ability to operate the \"machinery of government\" that allows them to guide legislation that align with their party's political and ideological priorities. Brazier argues that the legislative power of the prime minister has greatly expanded following the post-war period and that as a result, the prime minister now directly authorises supervision over government bills and has a consequential role in the introduction of legislation.\n\nThe prime minister is able to wield considerable power in the passing of legislation through their ability to manage party discipline and cohesion in voting patterns. Bogdanor states that this largely depends upon the prime minister being the leader of the largest party in the Commons, which can pass legislation without any or little resistance if they can command the confidence of the House. This aspect of prime ministerial power is informal and often carried out by the office of Whips, who makes sure that MPs remain loyal and vote on the government line. The political scientist Anthony King said that the prime minister's influence over legislation is further solidified through their ability to shape policy before it reaches parliament. King further argued that the shaping of legislation, on many occasions, involves the collaborative efforts of cabinet ministers and civil servants, but the prime minister's approval is needed in order to initiate the legislative agenda. King's analysis of contemporary politcs showed that some prime ministers often bypass or overrule the cabinet on traditional discussion and to push through their preferred agendas with notable cases such as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\n\nThe prime minister's influence in the Houses of Parliament is derived from longstanding conventions and statutes that have gradually evolved through the centuries. The office of prime minister itself is not explicitly mentioned in parliamentary law but is developed by constitutional conventions and therefore it is defined by precedent and tradition. Bogdanor notes that the prime minister's power in parliament is exhibited by their control of the executive (the Cabinet) and their ability to influence the legislative agenda. The ability of the prime minister to influence legislation, according to academic Philip Norton, is often through party discipline and having a reliable majority of MPs who vote in support of the government's priorities.\n\nAnother essential part of the parliamentary powers possessed by the prime minister is determining the composition of the Cabinet. According to Professor Robert Hazell, the prime minister not only chooses cabinet members but also dictates the collective decision-making process of members as well. The prime minister most often would chair cabinet meetings and may determine their frequency, thereby controlling the agenda for policy and steering decisions in their preferred direction. Additionally, the prime minister can exercise considerable control over parliamentary time. Authors Alexander Horne and Gavin Drewry state that the prime minister uses this power through the Leader of the House of Commons, by which they are able to allocate time for government bills and often ensuring access to this time over private members' bills.\n\nThe prime minister's parliamentary powers also extend to foreign relations. Contemporary historian Anthony Seldon says that the prime minister acts as the main representative of the government in the international sphere, including in parliament, where treaties are ratified and international commitments are debated.[full citation needed]\n\nThe most significant powers given to the prime minister are \"prerogative powers\". These are a set of constitutional privileges deriving from monarchial authority that have gradually evolved into tools of executive power managed by the prime minister and the government. Bagehot famously called the British system as one where \"the executive power is now yielded by the prime minister\" rather than the monarch, a shift from personal to political power. Prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act without the immediate or direct consent of parliament especially in circumstances such as declaring war, deployment of troops and the granting of honours.\n\nBrazier argues that prerogative powers allow the prime minister to act within the \"authority of the crown\" in situations where neither convention nor statutory law applies. As noted by both Bagehot and Brazier, areas in which the prime minister authorises their given prerogative powers are matters of foreign affairs. In recent occasions, the 2003 invasion of Iraq saw Prime Minister Tony Blair deploying British troops to Saudi Arabia without the immediate consent or approval of parliament.[43] Brazier says the rise of parliamentary and public scrutiny has led to calls for reform and checks on the use of prerogative powers.[45][46] The only prime minister who did not seek parliamentary or legal consent for military action was Anthony Eden during the Suez Crisis in 1956.[47][48]\n\nProfessors Mark Elliot and Robert Thomas argue that prerogative powers present a constitutional anomaly in the 21st century. Both contend that such powers lack direct democratic legitimacy due to not being regulated by parliamentary statutes and raise concerns over accountability. Elliot and Thomas have pointed out that judicial intervention in cases such as Miller I and Miller II, where the Supreme Court exercised scrutiny over the use of prerogative powers by the government to prorogue parliament during the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, was successful in keeping check over the authority of both the prime minister and the government. The evolving usage of prerogative powers also has signalled tension between tradition and accountability. Authors Paul Craig and Adam Tomkins state that the absence of a written constitution gives a prime minister greater leeway in employing their given prerogative powers without limits that in turn would create uncertainty although the use of such powers by the prime minister is often constrained by political convention than by law.\n\nThe British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution, meaning that it is not set out in any single document.[51] The British constitution consists of many documents, and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice. In 1928, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:\n\nThe relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution. Many of the prime minister's executive and legislative powers are actually royal prerogatives which are still formally vested in the sovereign, who remains the head of state.[53] Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the legal fiction was maintained that the sovereign still governed directly. The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the Chequers Estate Act. Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of prime minister featured in statute law and official documents; however, the prime minister's powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions. Prime ministers continue to hold the position of First Lord of the Treasury and, since November 1968, that of Minister for the Civil Service, the latter giving them authority over the civil service.\n\nUnder this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign. The concept of \"the Crown\" resolves this paradox.[54] The Crown symbolises the state's authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace. Before the \"Glorious Revolution\" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position. Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers (the prime minister and Cabinet), accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected House of Commons.\n\nAlthough many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact,[n 1] constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day-to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise and to warn.[55][56]\n\nIn modern times, much of the process involving prime ministerial appointments is informally governed by constitutional conventions and with the rules and processes described by authoritative sources such as The Cabinet Manual.[57]\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the monarch, through the exercise of the royal prerogative.[58] In the past, the monarch has used personal choice to dismiss or appoint a prime minister (the last time being in 1834), but it is now the convention that the monarch should not be drawn into party politics.[5]: 3 Bogdanor states that throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the monarch often appointed the prime minister based on their personal preference, regardless of whether they have great or little public support.\n\nIf a prime minister (incumbent or otherwise) leads their party to victory in a general election and gains an overall majority in the House of Commons they will be invited by the monarch to form a new government.[60] Following the invitation, the prime minister will be driven to Buckingham Palace to meet the monarch.[61][62][63] The meeting between the monarch and the incoming prime minister is a moment for the latter to pledge their loyalty to the monarch and seek permission to form a new government. The prime minister is expected to bow before the monarch in a ceremony known as \"kissing hands\". Following this, the prime minister is officially appointed the head of His Majesty's government.[64][65][66]\n\nThe prime minister \"...holds that position by virtue of his or her ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, which in turn commands the confidence of the electorate, as expressed through a general election.\"[5]: 3.1 By convention, the prime minister is also an MP and is normally the leader of the political party that commands a majority in the House of Commons.[5]: 3.1 [n 2]\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office helps the prime minister to 'establish and deliver the government's overall strategy and policy priorities, and to communicate the government's policies to Parliament, the public and international audiences'.[67] The Prime Minister's Office is formally part of the Cabinet Office, but the boundary between its work and that of the wider Cabinet Office can be unclear;[68] the wider Cabinet Office might carry out very similar work. Peter Hennessy has claimed that this overall arrangement means there is in fact effectively a Prime Minister's Department, though it is not called this.[69]\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office was officially created in 1916 by David Lloyd George during the World War I, which marked the first formal recognition of the office of prime minister and established it as an independent institution from other entities within government, with staff to support the coordination of government policy. This development came as a response to the demands of wartime governance, as Lloyd George's leadership needed a more centred and efficient executive function.\n\nPrime Minister's Questions is a constitutional convention, currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting, in which the prime minister answers questions from members of Parliament (MPs). The leader of the opposition usually asks the prime minister six questions, and the leader of the third-largest parliamentary party can ask two questions. It is an occasion when the prime minister appears regularly on live television and radio.\n\nBefore the 1880s, oral questions were mainly directed towards cabinet ministers and therefore such questions were regarded as the same even when addressed to the Prime Minister. The session in its modern form was first introduced on Tuesday 24 October in 1961 when the then Prime Minister Harold Macmillan answered questions for between 15 minutes from 3.15pm to 3.30pm as an experiment. Since 1997 PMQs were held every Wednesdays at 3pm until 3.30pm.[71] In 1989, the first PMQs were broadcast and in 1990 were broadcast live to the public as a step towards transparency and accountability.[72]\n\nThe timing of PMQs has often changed depending on the varied schedules of prime ministers.[73][74] In 1881, questions addressed to the prime minister were placed at the end of question time so that the then 72-year old Prime Minister William Gladstone could arrive late. In 1904, questions were answered only when they reached No 51 and in 1940 they were expanded to No 45. The procedure was in practice until 1953 when PMQs were restricted to Tuesdays and Thursdays only to assist Winston Churchill who was 78-years old.[75]\n\nThe prime minister also appears before the Liaison Committee to answer questions about public policy.[76]\n\nThe personal protection of the prime minister[77] and former prime ministers[78] is the responsibility of Protection Command within the Metropolitan Police Service. When the prime minister resides in 10 Downing Street, they are constantly surrounded by armed police units with \"airport-style\" security checkpoints, large metal gates, street patrols and heavy vetting for staff and non-ministerial individuals. Such installations were introduced due to fears of IRA bomb threats and attacks which were persistent during The Troubles. When travelling, the prime minister will be accompanied by a select group of police officers joined by a wider team of security personnel. On the road, the prime ministerial entourage will be followed by police outriders on motorbikes to clear a path in the traffic and to stop them from being a sitting target.[79] The fleet of Prime Ministerial Cars provides the prime minister with a number of security features as well as transport. The vehicles are driven by officers from this unit.[80] These vehicles are often custom made and always British manufactured with in-built gun ports, an independent oxygen supply and the ability to release tear gas to subdue angry crowds.[81] Air transport for the prime minister is provided by a variety of military and civilian operators.\n\nOne of the roles of the prime minister is to represent the UK at home and abroad,[82] for example at the annual G7 Summit. The prime minister makes many international trips. According to Gus O'Donnell, the number of overseas visits for the prime minister has gone up.[83]\n\nPrime ministers have had various deputies, sometimes as an official deputy prime minister, first secretary of state or de facto deputy. Some prime ministers have not chosen a deputy at all, preferring ad hoc arrangements.[84]\n\nHistorically, the position of deputy prime minister has been created out of political necessity rather than being established by statutory law or convention with the title not being defined in the constitution. The position was first created (unofficially) for Clement Attlee in Prime Minister Winston Churchill's ministry during World War II, in order to manage administrative duties, domestic affairs and welfare, while Churchill focused on military strategy. In recent times, after the 2010 general election resulted in a hung parliament, the leaders of the Conservative and the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, formed a coalition government in which Clegg served as deputy prime minister. In that capacity, Clegg chaired cabinet meetings, key committees and led negotiations on major reforms. As such, the office saw an unusual level of formalisation and recognition during Clegg's tenure.\n\nNobody has the right of automatic succession to the prime ministership.[88] It is generally considered that in the event of the death of the prime minister, it would be appropriate to appoint an interim prime minister, though there is some debate as to how to decide who this should be.[89]\n\nAccording to Rodney Brazier, there are no procedures within government to cope with the sudden death of the prime minister.[90] There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom.[91] Despite refusing \"...to discuss a hypothetical situation\" with BBC News in 2011,[92] the Cabinet Office said the following in 2006:[93]\n\nAdditionally, when the prime minister is travelling, it is standard practice for a senior duty minister to be appointed who can attend to urgent business and meetings if required, though the prime minister remains in charge and updated throughout.[94]\n\nOn 6 April 2020, when Boris Johnson was admitted into the Intensive Care Unit of St Thomas' Hospital, when suffering from COVID-19, he asked Dominic Raab \"to deputise for him where necessary\".[95]\n\nA prime minister ends their tenure by offering their resignation to the British monarch.[96] This can happen after their party has suffered a general election defeat, so that they no longer command the confidence of the House of Commons. It can also happen mid-term, if they are forced to resign for political reasons,[97] or for other reasons such as ill-health.[98] If the prime minister resigns mid-term, and their party has a majority in the Commons, the party selects a new leader according to its rules, and this new leader is invited by the monarch to become the new prime minister. The outgoing prime minister is likely to remain in post until the new leader has been chosen by the party. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a Member of Parliament. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister's Resignation Honours. No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election.[99] Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812.\n\nOn taking office a new prime minister usually makes a public statement to announce to the country that they have been appointed by the reigning monarch (called \"kissing hands\"). This is usually done by saying words to the effect of:\n\nMinisterial listings are printed in the official records of parliament known as \"Hansard\", and 1885 was the first known instance of official use of the title of Prime Minister. The minutes of the first meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1902 saw the first internal reference to the title as well. The 1904 edition of the Imperial Calendar referred to the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour, as 'Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury'; in the previous edition he was merely 'First Lord of the Treasury and Lord Privy Seal'.[101]\n\nThroughout the United Kingdom, the prime minister outranks all other dignitaries except members of the royal family, the lord chancellor, and senior ecclesiastical figures.[n 3] The prime minister was officially granted a place in the order of precedence in December 1905, and the first statutory reference to the Prime Minister was present in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, which specified Chequers as a prime-ministerial residence. Public recognition of the existence of a 'Prime Minister's Office' in the Civil Service Yearbook came as recently as the 1977 edition.[101]\n\nThe prime minister is customarily a member of the Privy Council and thus entitled to the appellation \"The Right Honourable\". Membership of the council is retained for life. It is a constitutional convention that only a privy counsellor can be appointed prime minister. Most potential candidates have already attained this status. The only case when a non-privy counsellor was the natural appointment was Ramsay MacDonald in 1924. The issue was resolved by appointing him to the Council immediately prior to his appointment as prime minister.\n\nAccording to the now-defunct Department for Constitutional Affairs, the prime minister is made a privy counsellor as a result of taking office and should be addressed by the official title prefixed by \"The Right Honourable\" and not by a personal name.[citation needed] Although this form of address is employed on formal occasions, it is rarely used by the media. As \"prime minister\" is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as \"the prime minister\", although the title \"Prime Minister\" (e.g. \"Prime Minister Keir Starmer\") has become commonplace within current political reporting.[102][103][104] Within the UK, the expression \"Prime Minister Starmer\" is never used, although it, too, is sometimes used by foreign dignitaries and news sources.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010, the prime minister received £14,500 in addition to a salary of £65,737 as a member of parliament.[105] Until 2006, the lord chancellor was the highest-paid member of the government, ahead of the prime minister. This reflected the lord chancellor's position at the head of the judicial pay scale. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 eliminated the lord chancellor's judicial functions and also reduced the office's salary to below that of the prime minister. During the premiership of Gordon Brown, the prime minister received an salary of £193,885 on 1 April 2009 which was higher than the salary of £166,786 as of 2024. The reasons for such reductions are Brown's cuts to voluntary pay at around £150,000 during pre-election in the May 2010 election, and when David Cameron became prime minister the cuts were extended to 5%, amounting at around £142,500. Subsequent prime ministers have kept the restraint on ministerial pay and have not taken any further pay outside of what they are entitled.[106] According to journalist Simon Kelner, the salary of the prime minister must be increased and that further expansion of a salary or hospitality received by a prime minister is disavowed under the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883 which only criminalised voter bribery and introduced standards for election expenses, and \"created a more level playing field for parliamentary candidates\". Kelner said that it is a inadequate way of holding a prime minister into account. This was in respone to the 2024 Labour Party freebies controversy, in which the current prime minister, Keir Starmer, having reportedly failed to disclose the amount of gifts and \"freebies\" received by him, members of his family and cabinet.[107][108][109]\n\n10 Downing Street, in London, has been the official place of residence of the prime minister since 1732; they are entitled to use its staff and facilities, including extensive offices. The building was originally given by King George I to Robert Walpole, widely regarded as the nation's first prime minister, as a personal gift. However, Walpole insisted that he would accept it in his capacity as first lord of the Treasury and requested that his subsequent successors be entitled to reside in and use the property as they wish.[110] The complex incorporates the flats of No.11 and No.12 Downing Street, which have been reconstructed through to connect them to No.10. Altogether, the three buildings contain over 100 rooms.[111]\n\nChequers, a country house in Buckinghamshire, gifted to the government in 1917, may be used as a country retreat for the prime minister. The estate was previously owned by the Conservative minister and First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Arthur Lee, before being donated to the British government under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. It was to give the incumbent prime minister the time to \"spend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern hills and woods\" and on the condition that incumbent should not own any residential country estate of their own.[112][113]\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, many prime ministers were members of the British nobility and therefore held the office whilst serving in the House of Lords. Through lineage and inheritance, these prime ministers acquired large estates, though they still owned properties in London for political affairs and many used country houses as a retreat. Until the mid-20th Century, parliamentary sessions did not begin until the New Year after ending in August, which would give the prime minister long periods in respite.[114]\n\nUpon retirement, it is customary for the sovereign to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly, but not invariably, membership of the UK's most senior order of chivalry, the Order of the Garter. The practice of creating a retired prime minister a Knight Companion of the Garter (KG) has been fairly prevalent since the mid-nineteenth century. Upon the retirement of a prime minister who is Scottish, it is likely that the primarily Scottish honour of Knight of the Thistle (KT) will be used instead of the Order of the Garter, which is generally regarded as an English honour.[n 4]\n\nHistorically it has also been common to grant prime ministers a peerage upon retirement from the Commons, elevating the individual to the Lords. Formerly, the peerage bestowed was usually an earldom.[n 5] The last such creation was for Harold Macmillan, who resigned in 1963. Unusually, he became Earl of Stockton only in 1984, over twenty years after leaving office.\n\nMacmillan's successors Alec Douglas-Home, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, David Cameron, and Theresa May all accepted life peerages (although Douglas-Home had previously disclaimed his hereditary title as Earl of Home and Cameron received a peerage after reentering Government as Foreign Secretary, not for services as a former Prime Minister). Edward Heath did not accept a peerage of any kind; neither have any of the prime ministers who have retired since 1990 other than Cameron (having done so to re-join the Cabinet, rather than as an honour per se) and May. Edward Heath (in 1992), John Major (in 2005) and Tony Blair (in 2022) were appointed as Knights Companion of the Garter. Major (in 1998) and Gordon Brown (in 2024) were appointed members of the Order of the Companions of Honour, although Blair had previously disclosed that he did not want honours bestowed on himself or future prime ministers.\n\nThe most recent former prime minister to die was Margaret Thatcher (1979–1990) on 8 April 2013. Her death meant that for the first time since 1955 (the year in which the Earldom of Attlee was created, subsequent to the death of Earl Baldwin in 1947) the membership of the House of Lords included no former prime minister, a situation which remained the case until David Cameron was appointed to the House in November 2023.\n\nThere are currently no established roles or job positions for former prime ministers following their resignations or after leaving office unexpectedly. It depends on their personal choice and reasons surrounding the need to take on such positions. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many former prime ministers, who were wealthy members of the nobility, would often simply retire to their country estates. The first prime minister, Robert Walpole, accumulated large personal wealth while serving in office and from previous investments made in the 1710s. Prime Ministers Lord Bute and Lord Rosebery were among the wealthiest men in the country during their retirements and are often touted as some of the wealthiest to serve as in office. However some prime ministers, such as William Pitt the Elder and his son William Pitt the Younger, amassed large public debts that were later paid off by parliament. In 1937, an official pension for former prime ministers was given at the sum of £2000 per annum.[117]\n\nIn their retirements, a majority of former prime ministers have written memoirs and autobiographies. Some prime ministers have also written non-political books as well, including Winston Churchill's histories of World War II and of the English language,[118][119] Edward Heath's books on his wider interests in sailing, music and travel, Major's history of cricket[120][121] and Arthur Balfour's philosophical writings.[122] Some prime ministers such as William Gladstone mainly wrote tracts and tomes on theology and religion[123] and Benjamin Disraeli wrote many best-selling novels in addition to memoirs and history.[124][117][125]\n\nIn the 21st century, many former prime ministers have set up their own foundations and charities to be used as a platform to continue involvement in political and public issues after they leave office.[117] In 1991, Margaret Thatcher became the first prime minister to set up her own foundation to try to secure her legacy and propagate her ideology known as Thatcherism, but it closed down in 2005.[126] Tony Blair has set up a sports foundation, an inter-faith foundation and the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in 2016.[127] In his post-premiership, Blair is also the first prime minister to take on a major international role, as an official envoy of the Quartet on the Middle East.[128] Gordon Brown was actively involved in politics long after he left office, most notably during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in which he campaigned for the no vote that advocated Scotland to remain in the union.[129][130]\n\nHowever, some former prime ministers have returned to serve in the governments of their successors, and a few have had 'retreads' that saw them serve short tenures due to their successors unexpectedly resigning or passing away. Notable cases include the Duke of Wellington who, after serving two brief terms in office, was able to command significant influence as a senior member of the Tory party and returned to serve in two governments of his successor, Sir Robert Peel, as Foreign Secretary and Minister without portfolio. He later retired to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the Army from 1842 until his death in 1852.[117] Arthur Balfour served as prime minister for three years of his term after he was defeated in the 1906 general election and later went on to serve as the Foreign Secretary for eleven years in the imperial war cabinet during and after World War I under three prime ministers. After Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister in May 1940, he returned to serve under Winston Churchill in his subsequent war cabinet. Alec Douglas-Home, who resigned after losing the 1964 general election, later came to serve in the cabinet of Edward Heath in 1970.[131]\n\nAll former prime ministers are entitled to claim for salary or office expenses incurred in fulfilling public duties in that role. The allowance may not be used to pay for private or parliamentary duties. It is administered by the Cabinet Office Finance Team.\n\nThe maximum amount which may be claimed per year is £115,000, plus 10% towards any staff pension costs. This limit is reviewed annually, and at the start of each Parliament, by the current prime minister. The maximum level may be adjusted downwards if the former prime minister receives any public funds for fulfilling other public appointments.[132] Downing Street confirmed in November 2023 that former prime minister David Cameron would not claim from the PDCA while he acted as Foreign Secretary.[133]\n\nLists of prime ministers by different criteria\n\nAll lists: Category:Lists of prime ministers of the United Kingdom\n\nMore related pages: Category:Prime ministers of the United Kingdom\n• None Bogdanor, Vernon (1997).

A prime minister is not the head of state, but rather the head of government, serving as the chief of the executive under either a monarch or a president in a republican form of government.\n\nIn parliamentary systems of government (be they constitutional monarchies or parliamentary republics), the Prime Minister (or occasionally a similar post with a different title, such as the Chancellor of Germany) is the most powerful politician and the functional leader of the state, by virtue of commanding the confidence of the legislature. The head of state is typically a ceremonial officer, though they may exercise reserve powers to check the Prime Minister in unusual situations.\n\nUnder some presidential systems, such as South Korea and Peru, the prime minister is the leader or the most senior member of the cabinet, but not the head of government. As such, in South Korea, the prime minister is equivalent to that of a vice president which is the second in-command and assumes the presidency in the absence of the president.\n\nIn many systems, the prime minister selects and may dismiss other members of the cabinet, and allocates posts to members within the government. In most systems, the prime minister is the presiding member and chairman of the cabinet. In a minority of systems, notably in semi-presidential systems, a prime minister is the official appointed to manage the civil service and execute the directives of the head of state.\n\nToday, the prime minister is often, but not always, a member of the legislature or its lower house, and is expected with other ministers to ensure the passage of bills through the legislature. In some monarchies the monarch may also exercise executive powers (known as the royal prerogative) without the approval of parliament.\n\nAs well as being head of government, being prime minister may require holding other roles or posts—the prime minister of the United Kingdom, for example, is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service.[note 1] In some cases, prime ministers may choose to hold additional ministerial posts (e.g. when the portfolio is critical to that government's mandate): during the Second World War, Winston Churchill was also Minister of Defence (although there was then no Ministry of Defence). Another example is the Thirty-fourth government of Israel (2015–2019) , when Benjamin Netanyahu at one point served as the prime minister and minister of Communications, Foreign Affairs, Regional Cooperation, Economy, Defense and Interior.\n\nThe term \"prime minister\" was used as (vazîr-i aʾzam) or the Grand Vizier in 8th century by the Abbasid caliphate.[1][2][3]\n\nin 17th century sources referring to Cardinal Richelieu,[4] after he was named premier ministre to head the French royal council in 1624. The title was used alongside the principal ministre d'État (\"chief minister of the state\") more as a job description. After 1661, Louis XIV and his descendants refused to allow one of their Ministers to be more important than the others, so the term was no longer in use.[5]\n\nIn the 18th century in the United Kingdom, members of parliament disparagingly used the title in reference to Sir Robert Walpole (whose official title was First Lord of the Treasury). During the whole of the 18th century, Britain was involved in a prolonged conflict with France, periodically bursting into all-out war, and Britons took outspoken pride in their \"Liberty\" as contrasted to the \"Tyranny\" of French Absolute Monarchy; therefore, being implicitly compared with Richelieu was no compliment to Walpole. Over time, however, the title became honorific[where?] and remains so in the 21st century.[6]\n\nThe position of a head of government separate from the head of state, or as the most important government administrator or minister after the monarch in rank developed in multiple countries separate from each other. The names given could be \"prime minister\", although other terms were also used such as \"chief minister\", \"grand chancellor\", \"chancellor\", \"grand vizier\", \"counselor\", and others.\n\nThe literal title itself can be traced back to the Abbasid caliphate and the Ottoman Empire . They both had an official title of Grand Vizier simply the Head of the Government which is called Prime Minister nowadays. Grand Vizier was the most powerful person after sultan but sometimes the Grand Vizier of Ottoman Empire was more powerful than sultan himself.[7][8][9] The position of Chancellor is the same or comparable in some countries as a prime minister, even if the label is different. The term goes back to ancient Roman times as head of the chancellery. This title as head of government or the administration existed in ancient China as Grand Chancellor (Chinese: 宰相; pinyin: Zǎixiàng), sometimes translated as \"prime minister\", existed since 685 BCE and ancient Japan Chancellor of the Realm (太政大臣 Daijō-daijin) since the 7th century CE. In the Holy Roman Empire the position of Archchancellor was the highest dignitary and traces to 860 CE, out of which later derived the positions of head of government such as the modern Chancellor of Germany, who is head of the federal government and an executive prime minister.\n\nThe power of these ministers depended entirely on the personal favour of the monarch. Although managing the parliament was among the necessary skills of holding high office, they did not depend on a parliamentary majority for their power. Although there was a cabinet, it was appointed entirely by the monarch, and the monarch usually presided over its meetings.\n\nThe monarch could dismiss the minister at any time, or worse: Cromwell was executed and Clarendon driven into exile when they lost favour. Kings sometimes divided power equally between two or more ministers to prevent one minister from becoming too powerful. Late in Anne's reign, for example, the Tory ministers Harley and Viscount Bolingbroke shared power.\n\nIn the mid 17th century, after the English Civil War (1642–1651), Parliament strengthened its position relative to the monarch then gained more power through the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights in 1689.[10] The monarch could no longer establish any law or impose any tax without its permission and thus the House of Commons became a part of the government. It is at this point that a modern style of prime minister begins to emerge.[11][12]\n\nA tipping point in the evolution of the prime ministership came with the death of Anne in 1714 and the accession of George I to the throne. George spoke no English, spent much of his time at his home in Hanover, and had neither knowledge of, nor interest in, the details of British government. In these circumstances it was inevitable that the king's first minister would become the de facto head of the government.\n\nFrom 1721, this was the Whig politician Robert Walpole, who held office for twenty-one years. Walpole chaired cabinet meetings, appointed all the other ministers, dispensed the royal patronage and packed the House of Commons with his supporters. Under Walpole, the doctrine of cabinet solidarity developed. Walpole required that no minister other than himself have private dealings with the king, and also that when the cabinet had agreed on a policy, all ministers must defend it in public, or resign. As a later prime minister, Lord Melbourne, said, \"It matters not what we say, gentlemen, so long as we all say the same thing.\"\n\nWalpole always denied that he was \"prime minister\", and throughout the 18th century parliamentarians and legal scholars continued to deny that any such position was known to the Constitution. George II and George III made strenuous efforts to reclaim the personal power of the monarch, but the increasing complexity and expense of government meant that a minister who could command the loyalty of the Commons was increasingly necessary. The long tenure of the wartime prime minister William Pitt the Younger (1783–1801), combined with the mental illness of George III, consolidated the power of the post. The title \"prime minister\" was first referred to on government documents during the administration of Benjamin Disraeli but did not appear in the formal British Order of precedence until 1905.\n\nThe prestige of British institutions in the 19th century and the growth of the British Empire saw the British model of cabinet government, headed by a prime minister, widely copied, both in other European countries and in British colonial territories as they developed self-government.[13][14][15] In some places alternative titles such as \"premier\", \"chief minister\", \"first minister of state\", \"president of the council\" or \"chancellor\" were adopted, but the essentials of the office were the same.\n\nIn the late 20th century,[16][17] many of the world's countries had prime ministers or equivalent ministers, holding office under either constitutional monarchies or ceremonial presidents. The main exceptions to this system include Switzerland and the United States, as well as the presidential republics in Latin America, such as Chile and Mexico, modelled on the U.S. system in which the president directly exercises executive authority.\n\nBahrain's former prime minister, Sheikh Khalifah bin Sulman Al Khalifah, occupied the post for about 50 years, from 1970 to November 2020, making him the longest serving non-elected prime minister.\n\nThe post of prime minister may be encountered both in constitutional monarchies (such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Malaysia, Morocco, Spain,[note 2] Sweden, Thailand, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) and in parliamentary republics, in which the head of state is an elected official (such as Bangladesh, Finland, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia (1945–66), Ireland, Nigeria (1960–66), Pakistan, Montenegro, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Turkey (1923–2018) and Italy). See also \"First Minister\", \"Premier\", \"Chief Minister\", \"Chancellor\", \"Taoiseach\", \"Minister of State (Statsminister)\", \"President of the Government\", \"President of the Council of Ministers\" and \"Secretary of State\": alternative titles usually equivalent in meaning to, or translated as, \"prime minister\". Both Indonesia and Nigeria lost their positions as prime ministers in 1966. Brazil, Iran, the Philippines and Turkey also lost their positions as prime ministers. Chile, Mexico, Switzerland and the United States never had positions as prime ministers.\n\nThis contrasts with the presidential system, in which the president (or equivalent) is both the head of state and the head of the government. In some presidential and all semi-presidential systems, such as those of Algeria, Argentina, China, France, Poland, Russia, South Korea or Ukraine, the prime minister is an official generally appointed by the president but usually approved by the legislature and responsible for carrying out the directives of the president and managing the civil service. The premier of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is also appointed by the president but does not require any approval by the legislature.[citation needed]\n\nAppointment of the prime minister of France does not require any approval by the parliament either, but the parliament may force the resignation of the government. In these systems, it is possible for the president and the prime minister to be from different political parties if the legislature is controlled by a party different from that of the president. When it arises, such a state of affairs is usually referred to as (political) cohabitation.[citation needed]\n\nIn parliamentary systems a prime minister may enter into office by several means.\n• The head of state appoints a prime minister, of their personal choice: Example: France, where the president has the power to appoint the prime minister of their choice, though the National Assembly can force a government to resign, they cannot nominate or appoint a new candidate.\n• The head of state appoints a prime minister who has a set timescale within which they must gain a vote of confidence: Example: Italy, Romania, Thailand\n• The head of state appoints a formateur from among the members of Parliament, who then has a set timescale within which they must form a cabinet, and receive the confidence of Parliament after presenting the Cabinet Composition and Legislative Program to Parliament, and the formateur becomes prime minister once approved by parliament: Example: Israel\n• The head of state appoints the leader of the political party with the majority of the seats in the parliament as prime minister. If no party has a majority, then the leader of the party with a plurality of seats is given an exploratory mandate to receive the confidence of the parliament within three days. If this is not possible, then the leader of the party with the second highest seat number is given the exploratory mandate. If this fails, then the leader of the third largest party is given it and so on: Example: Greece, see Prime Minister of Greece\n• The head of state nominates a candidate for prime minister who is then submitted to parliament for approval before appointment as prime minister: Example: Spain, where the King sends a nomination to parliament for approval. Also Germany where under the German Basic Law (constitution) the Bundestag votes on a candidate nominated by the federal president. In the Philippines under the 1973 Constitution as amended after martial law, the prime minister was elected by the Batasang Pambansâ (Legislature) upon nomination by the president. In these cases, parliament can choose another candidate who then would be appointed by the head of state (or, in the case of the Philippines, outright elect that candidate).\n• Parliament nominates a candidate who the head of state is then constitutionally obliged to appoint as prime minister: Example: Ireland, where the president appoints the Taoiseach on the nomination of Dáil Éireann. Also Japan.\n• Election by the legislature: Example: Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Also the Philippines under the unamended 1973 Constitution, where the prime minister was supposed to be elected by the Batasang Pambansâ; these provisions were never used because the Philippines was under martial law at the time.\n• Direct election by popular vote: Example: Israel, 1996–2001, where the prime minister was elected in a general election, with no regard to political affiliation.\n• Nomination by a state office holder other than the head of state or his or her representative: Example: Under the modern Swedish Instrument of Government, the power to appoint someone to form a government has been moved from the monarch to the speaker of the parliament and the parliament itself. The speaker nominates a candidate, who is then elected to prime minister (statsminister) by the parliament if an absolute majority of the members of parliament does not vote no (i.e. the candidate can be elected to the post even if more MP:s vote no than yes).\n\nIn older, convention-based parliamentary systems, prime ministers are not appointed for a specific term in office and in effect may remain in power through a number of elections and parliaments. For example, Margaret Thatcher was only ever appointed prime minister on one occasion, in 1979. She remained continuously in power until 1990, though she used the assembly of each House of Commons after a general election to reshuffle her cabinet.\n\nNewer parliamentary systems that operate based on a codified constitution, however, do have a term of office of the prime minister linked to the period in office of the parliament. Hence, for example, Latvian prime minister Krišjānis Kariņš, who was first appointed in 2018, had to be reappointed as head of a new government following the 2022 Latvian parliamentary election.\n\nThe position of prime minister is usually chosen from the political party that commands – whether by itself or as the largest member of a coalition – the majority of seats in the lower house of parliament, though this is not a requirement either; for example, following the 2018 Latvian parliamentary election, after two failed attempts by larger parties to form a coalition headed by them, the leader of the smallest party in parliament – Krišjānis Kariņš – was eventually appointed as a compromise candidate. Italy has seen several emergency technocratic governments, such as Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's and Mario Draghi's governments, where the prime minister was a non-partisan expert backed by the confidence and supply of a broad cross-section of the parliament.\n\nIn parliamentary systems, governments are generally required to have the confidence of the lower house of parliament (though a small minority of parliaments, by giving a right to block supply to upper houses, in effect make the cabinet responsible to both houses, though in reality upper houses, even when they have the power, rarely exercise it). Where they lose a vote of confidence, have a motion of no confidence passed against them, or where they lose supply, most constitutional systems require either:\n\nThe latter in effect allows the government to appeal the opposition of parliament to the electorate. However, in many jurisdictions a head of state may refuse a parliamentary dissolution, requiring the resignation of the prime minister and his or her government. In most modern parliamentary systems, the prime minister is the person who decides when to request a parliamentary dissolution.\n\nOlder constitutions often vest this power in the cabinet. In the United Kingdom, for example, the tradition whereby it is the prime minister who requests a dissolution of parliament dates back to 1918. Prior to then, it was the entire government that made the request. Similarly, though the modern 1937 Irish constitution grants to the Taoiseach the right to make the request, the earlier 1922 Irish Free State Constitution vested the power in the Executive Council (the then name for the Irish cabinet).\n\nSome systems, such as Germany and Spain, require motions of no confidence to be constructive: i.e., they must include the name of an alternative prime minister; if the motion of no confidence is successful, the alternative prime minister automatically takes office in place of the incumbent government, which cannot appeal this replacement to the electorate.\n\nIn Australia, the prime minister is expected to step down if they lose the majority support of their party under a spill motion as have many such as Tony Abbott, Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nThe prime minister's executive office is usually called the Office of the Prime Minister or Cabinet Office. The U.K.’s Cabinet Office includes the Prime Minister’s Office. Conversely, some Prime Minister's Offices incorporate the role of Cabinet, while Australia’s Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet joins them at par. In Israel, the prime minister's executive office is officially titled the \"Prime Minister's Office\" in English, but the original Hebrew term can also be translated as the Prime Minister's Ministry. The Prime Minister's Department is also used, as is Cabinet Department.\n\nWilfried Martens, who served as Prime Minister of Belgium, described his role as follows:\n\nIn many cases, though commonly used, \"prime minister\" is not the official title of the office-holder. In the Russian constitution, the prime minister is titled Chairman of the government. The Irish prime minister is called the Taoiseach (which is rendered into English as prime minister), in Israel the prime minister is Rosh HaMemshalah, meaning \"head of the government\", and the Spanish prime minister is the President of the Government (Presidente del Gobierno). The head of government of the People's Republic of China is referred to as the Premier of the State Council.[citation needed]\n\nOther common forms include president of the council of ministers (for example in Italy, Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri), President of the Executive Council, or Minister-President. In the Nordic countries the prime minister is called Statsminister, meaning \"Minister of State\". In federations, the head of government of a federated entity (such as the province or territory of Canada, the province of Argentina or the state of Brazil) is most commonly known as the premier, chief minister, governor or minister-president.[citation needed]\n\nIt is convention in the English language to call nearly all national heads of government \"prime minister\" (or sometimes the equivalent term \"premier\"), except in cases where the head of state and head of government are one position (usually a presidency), regardless of the correct title of the head of government as applied in his or her respective country. The few exceptions to the rule are Germany and Austria, whose head of government's title is Federal Chancellor; Monaco, whose head of government is referred to as the Minister of State; and Vatican City, for which the head of government is titled the Secretary of State. A stand-out case is the president of Iran, who is not actually a head of state, but the head of the government of Iran. He is referred to as \"president\" in both the Persian and English languages.\n\nIn non-Commonwealth countries, the prime minister may be entitled to the style of Excellency like a president. In some Commonwealth countries, prime ministers and former prime ministers are styled Honourable or Right Honourable associated with their position (the prime minister of Australia or the prime minister of Canada, for example). In the United Kingdom, the prime minister and former prime ministers are also often styled Honourable or Right Honourable; however, this is not due to their position as head of government, but a privilege of being current members of His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council.[18]\n\nIn the UK, where devolved government is in place, the leaders of the Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh Governments are styled First Minister. Between 1921 and 1972, when Northern Ireland had a majority rule Parliament, the head of government was the prime minister of Northern Ireland. In Bangladesh, the prime minister is called Prodhān Montrī, literally meaning \"the head of ministers\" or \"prime minister\". In India, the prime minister is called Pradhān Mantrī, literally meaning \"the head of ministers\" or \"prime minister\". In Pakistan, the prime minister is referred to as Wazir-e-Azam, meaning \"grand vizier\".\n\nThe position, power and status of prime ministers differ depending on the age of the constitution.\n\nAlgeria's constitution (1962) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Algeria.\n\nAustralia's constitution makes no mention of a prime minister of Australia and the office only exists by convention, based on the British model.\n\nBangladesh's constitution clearly outlines the functions and powers of the prime minister, and also details the process of his/her appointment and dismissal.\n\nThe People's Republic of China constitution set a premier just one place below the National People's Congress in China. Premier read as (Simplified Chinese: 总理; pinyin: Zŏnglĭ) in Chinese.\n\nCanada has a 'mixed' or hybrid constitution, partly formally codified and partly uncodified. The codified part originally made no reference whatsoever to a prime minister[19] and still gives no parameters of the office. Instead, their powers, duties, appointment and termination follow uncodified conventions. The Constitution Act, 1867 only establishes the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, to which all federal ministers (among others) are appointed and with Members[note 3] of which the Monarch or their Governor General normally performs executive government (as King- or Governor-in-Council).[20] The Constitution Act, 1982, adds passing reference to the \"Prime Minister of Canada\" [French: premier ministre du Canada] but as detail of conferences of federal and provincial first ministers.)[21]\n\nCzech Republic's constitution clearly outlines the functions and powers of the prime minister of the Czech Republic, and also details the process of his/her appointment and dismissal.\n\nFrance's constitution (1958) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of France.\n\nGermany's Basic Law (1949) lists the powers, functions and duties of the federal chancellor.\n\nGreece's constitution (1975) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Greece.\n\nHungary's constitution (2012) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Hungary.\n\nIndia's constitution (1950) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of India. In India, prime ministerial candidates must be a member of parliament, i.e. of either the Lok Sabha (Lower House) or Rajya Sabha (Upper House). No parliamentary vote takes place on who forms a government.\n\nIreland's constitution (1937), provides for the office of Taoiseach in detail, listing powers, functions and duties.\n\nItaly's constitution (1948) lists the powers, functions and duties of the president of the Council of Ministers.\n\nJapan's constitution (1946) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Japan.\n\nThe Republic of Korea's constitution (1987) sections 86–87 list the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of the Republic of Korea.\n\nMalta's constitution (1964) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Malta.\n\nMalaysia's constitution (1957) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Malaysia.\n\nNorway's constitution (1814) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Norway\n\nPakistan's constitution (1973) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Pakistan.\n\nPoland's constitution (1918) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Poland.\n\nSpain's constitution (1978) regulates the appointment, dismissal, powers, functions and duties of the President of the Government.\n\nSri Lanka's constitution (1978) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Sri Lanka.\n\nThailand's constitution (1932) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Thailand.\n\nTaiwan's constitution (1946) lists the powers, functions and duties of the president of the Executive Yuan.\n\nThe United Kingdom's constitution, being uncodified and largely unwritten, makes no mention of a prime minister. Though it had de facto existed for centuries, its first mention in official state documents did not occur until the first decade of the twentieth century. Accordingly, it is often said \"not to exist\"; indeed there are several instances of parliament declaring this to be the case. The prime minister sits in the cabinet solely by virtue of occupying another office, either First Lord of the Treasury (office in commission) or more rarely Chancellor of the Exchequer (the last of whom was Balfour in 1905).\n\nDuring the period between the time it is clear that the incumbent government has been defeated at a general election, and the actual swearing-in of the new prime minister by the monarch, governor-general, or president, that person is referred to as the \"prime minister-elect\" or \"prime minister-designate\". Neither term is strictly correct from a constitutional point of view, but they have wide acceptance. In a situation in which a ruling party elects or appoints a new leader, the incoming leader will usually be referred as \"prime minister-in-waiting\". An example or this situation was in 2016 in the United Kingdom when Theresa May was elected leader of the Conservative Party while David Cameron was still prime minister.\n\nRussia's constitution (1993) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Russia.\n\nUkraine's constitution (1996) lists the powers, functions and duties of the prime minister of Ukraine.\n\nThe following table groups the list of past and present prime ministers and details information available in those lists.\n• List of current prime ministers by date of assumption of office\n• List of current heads of state and government\n• Andrew Blick & George Jones, Premiership: The Development, Nature and Power of the Office of the British Prime Minister (Exeter: Imprint Academic, 2010), ISBN 9781845406479.\n• Peter Hennessy, The Prime Minister: The Office and Its Holders Since 1945 (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2001), ISBN 978-0-312-29313-0.\n• Paul Langford, \"Prime Ministers and Parliaments: The Long View, Walpole to Blair.\", The Annual History of Parliament Lecture, 2005, Parliamentary History, 25, 3 (2006): 382–394, doi:10.1353/pah.2006.0045.\n• James Manor, Nehru to the Nineties: The Changing Office of Prime Minister in India (C.

His experiences as a teacher, father, leader, and advocate for youth have shaped his dedication to Canadians.\n\nThe oldest of three boys, Justin grew up with the profound influence of his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and his mother, Margaret Trudeau. He graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Arts in 1994. He went on to complete the University of British Columbia’s education program, and spent several years teaching in Vancouver.\n\nJustin entered politics to make change that would better serve all Canadians. In 2007, he built a grassroots campaign to win the Liberal Party nomination in the Montréal riding of Papineau. He was elected in 2008, and re-elected in 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2021.\n\nJustin was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in April 2013.

On September 20, 2021, Justin once again led the party to re-election, earning a third mandate to govern from Canadians.\n\nAs Prime Minister, Justin leads a government that works hard to continue moving Canada forward. His team is focused on fighting climate change, creating good middle-class jobs, making life more affordable, keeping Canada’s communities safe, and moving forward on reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples.Togo - Wikipedia: Togo,[a] officially the Togolese Republic,[b] is a country in West Africa. It is bordered by Ghana to the west, Benin to the east and Burkina Faso to the north.[11] It is one of the least developed countries and extends south to the Gulf of Guinea, where its capital, Lomé, is located.[11] It is a small, tropical country, spanning 57,000 square kilometres (22,000 square miles)[4] with a population of approximately 8 million,[4] and it has a width of less than 115 km (71 mi) between Ghana and its eastern neighbour Benin.[12][13]\n\nVarious peoples settled the boundaries of present day Togo between the 11th and 16th centuries. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, the coastal region served primarily as a European slave trading outpost, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The Slave Coast\". In 1884, Germany declared a region including a protectorate called Togoland. After World War I, rule over Togo was transferred to France. Togo gained independence from France in 1960.[2][14] In 1967, Gnassingbé Eyadéma led a successful military coup d'état and became president of an anti-communist, single-party state. In 1993, Eyadéma faced multiparty elections marred by irregularities, and won the presidency three times. At the time of his death, Eyadéma was the \"longest-serving leader in modern African history\", having been president for 38 years.[15] In 2005, his son Faure Gnassingbé was elected president.\n\nTogo is a tropical, sub-Saharan nation[11] whose economy depends mostly on agriculture.[14] The official language is French,[14] but other languages are spoken, particularly those of the Gbe family. 47.8% of the population adhere to Christianity, making it the largest religion in the country.[16] Togo is a member of the United Nations, African Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone, Francophonie, Commonwealth of Nations, and Economic Community of West African States.\n\nArchaeological finds indicate that tribes were able to produce pottery and process iron. The name Togo is translated from the Ewe language as \"behind the river\". During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, tribes entered the region: the Ewé from the west, and the Mina and Gun from the east. Most of them settled in coastal areas. The Atlantic slave trade began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The Slave Coast\".\n\nIn 1884, a paper was signed at Togoville with King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a protectorate over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the German colony of Togoland. The local population was forced to work, cultivate cotton, coffee, and cocoa and pay taxes. A railway and the port of Lomé were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced techniques of cultivation of cocoa, coffee and cotton and developed the infrastructure.\n\nDuring the First World War, Togoland was invaded by Britain and France, proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium. The Togoland Campaign involved the successful French and British invasion of the German colony of Togoland during the West African Campaign of the First World War. Following the Allied invasion of the colony in August 1914, German forces were defeated, forcing the colony's surrender on 26 August 1914. On 7 December 1916, the condominium collapsed and Togoland was subsequently partitioned into British and French zones, creating the colonies of British Togoland and French Togoland. On 20 July 1922, Great Britain received the League of Nations mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament.\n\nAfter World War II, these mandates became UN Trust Territories. The residents of British Togoland voted to join the Gold Coast as part of the independent nation of Ghana in 1957. French Togoland became an autonomous republic within the French Union in 1959, while France retained the right to control defence, foreign relations, and finances.\n\nThe Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960. In the first presidential elections in 1961, Sylvanus Olympio became the first president, gaining 100% of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961, the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the National Assembly of Togo.[17] In December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the United States, United Kingdom, and West Germany. He rejected the efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the Algerian War and tried to get a position in the Togolese army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963 during which he was assassinated by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant Gnassingbé Eyadéma.[18] A state of emergency was declared in Togo. The military handed over power to an interim government led by Nicolas Grunitzky. In May 1963, Grunitzky was elected President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.\n\nOn 13 January 1967, Eyadéma Gnassingbé overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency.[19] He created the Rally of the Togolese People Party, banned activities of other political parties and introduced a 1-party system in November 1969. He was reelected in 1979 and 1986. In 1983, the privatization program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, EU froze the partnership, describing Eyadema's re-election in 1993, 1998 and 2003, as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in Brussels, talks were held between the European Union and Togo on the resumption of cooperation.\n\nEyadéma Gnassingbé died on Saturday, 5 February 2005. The military's installation of his son, Faure Gnassingbé,[19] as president provoked international condemnation, except from France. Some \"democratically elected\" African leaders such as Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria supported the move, thereby creating a rift within the African Union.[20] Gnassingbé left power and held elections, which he won two months later. The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to democracy that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with EU which cut off aid in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. Up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the UN. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighbouring countries. Gnassingbé was reelected in 2010 and 2015.\n\nTogo became the first African nation to win an Olympic medal in canoeing at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing when Benjamin Boukpeti won bronze in the K-1 slalom.\n\nIn 2017, anti-government protests erupted. UN condemned the resulting crackdown by security forces, and Gambia's foreign minister, Ousainou Darboe, had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingbé should resign.[21]\n\nIn the February 2020 presidential elections, Faure Gnassingbé won his fourth presidential term in office as the president of Togo.[22] According to the official result, he won with a margin of around 72% of the vote share. This enabled him to defeat his closest challenger, the former prime minister Agbeyome Kodjo who had 18%.[23] On 4 May 2020, Bitala Madjoulba, the commander of a Togolese military battalion, was found dead in his office. The day of Madjoulba's death came after the re-elected Faure Gnassingbé was sworn in for his fourth term. An investigation was opened for this case, resulting in Major General Kadangha Abalo Felix being prosecuted and tried for involvement in Madjoulba's assassination and 'conspiracy against the internal security of the state.' [24][25]\n\nTogo joined the Commonwealth in June 2022.[26] Prior to its admission at the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Foreign Minister Robert Dussey said that he expected Commonwealth membership to provide new export markets, funding for development projects and opportunities for Togolese citizens to learn English and access new educational and cultural resources.[27]\n\nThe president is elected by universal and direct suffrage for five years, and is the commander of the armed forces and has the right to initiate legislation and dissolve parliament. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. The head of government is the Prime Minister who is appointed by the president.\n\nPresident Gnassingbé Eyadéma, who ruled Togo under a one-party system, died of a heart attack on 5 February 2005. Under the Togolese Constitution, the President of the Parliament, Fambaré Ouattara Natchaba, should have become president of the country, pending a presidential election to be called within 60 days. Natchaba was out of the country, returning on an Air France plane from Paris.[28] The Togolese army, known as Forces Armées Togolaises (FAT), or Togolese Armed Forces, closed the nation's borders, forcing the plane to land in Benin. With an engineered power vacuum, the Parliament voted to remove the constitutional clause that would have required an election within 60 days and declared that Eyadema's son, Faure Gnassingbé, would inherit the presidency and hold office for the rest of his father's term.[28] Faure was sworn in on 7 February 2005, with international criticism of the succession.[29] The African Union described the takeover as a military coup d'état.[30] International pressure also came from the United Nations. Within Togo, opposition to the takeover culminated in riots in which between 400 and 500 people died.[31] There were uprisings in cities and towns mainly in the southern part of the country. In the town of Aného reports of a general civilian uprising followed by a massacre by government troops. In response, Faure Gnassingbé agreed to hold elections and on 25 February, Gnassingbé resigned as president, and afterward accepted the nomination to run for the office in April.[32]\n\nOn 24 April 2005, Gnassingbé was elected president of Togo, receiving over 60% of the vote according to official results. His main rival in the race had been Emmanuel Bob-Akitani from the Union des Forces du Changement (UFC). Electoral fraud was suspected due to a lack of European Union or other independent oversight.[33] Parliament designated Deputy President, Bonfoh Abbass, as interim president until the inauguration.[32] On 3 May 2005, Faure Gnassingbé was sworn in as the new president and the European Union suspended aid to Togo in support of the opposition claims, unlike the African Union and the United States which declared the vote \"reasonably fair\". The Nigerian president and Chair of AU, Olusẹgun Ọbasanjọ, sought to negotiate between the incumbent government and the opposition to establish a coalition government, and rejected an AU Commission appointment of former Zambian president, Kenneth Kaunda, as special AU envoy to Togo.[34][35] In June, President Gnassingbé named opposition leader Edem Kodjo as the prime minister.\n\nIn October 2007, after postponements, elections were held under proportional representation. This allowed the less populated north to seat as many MPs as the more populated south.[36] The president-backed party Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) won a majority with UFC coming second and the other parties claiming inconsequential representation. Vote rigging accusations were levelled at RPT supported by the civil and military security apparatus. With the presence of an EU observer mission, cancelled ballots and illegal voting took place, the majority of which in RPT strongholds. On 3 December 2007 Komlan Mally of RPT was appointed to prime minister succeeding Agboyibor. On 5 September 2008, Mally resigned as prime minister of Togo.\n\nFaure Gnassingbé won re-election in the March 2010 presidential election, taking 61% of the vote against Jean-Pierre Fabre from UFC, who had been backed by an opposition coalition called FRAC (Republican Front for Change).[37] Electoral observers noted \"procedural errors\" and technical problems, and the opposition did not recognize the results, claiming irregularities had affected the outcome.[38][39] Periodic protests against Faure Gnassingbé followed the election.[40] In May 2010, opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio announced that he would enter into a power-sharing deal with the government, a coalition arrangement which provides UFC with eight ministerial posts.[41][42] In June 2012, electoral reforms prompted protesters to take to the street in Lomé for days; protesters sought a return to the 1992 constitution that would re-establish presidential term limits.[43] July 2012 saw the resignation of the prime minister, Gilbert Houngbo.[44] Days later, the commerce minister, Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu, was named to lead the new government. In the same month, the home of opposition leader Jean-Pierre Fabre was raided by security forces, and thousands of protesters again rallied publicly against the government crackdown.[45]\n\nIn April 2015, President Faure Gnassingbé was re-elected for a third term.[46] In February 2020, Faure Gnassingbé was again re-elected for his fourth presidential term. The opposition had accusations of fraud and irregularities.[47] The Gnassingbé family has ruled Togo since 1967, meaning it is Africa's longest lasting dynasty.[48]\n\nIn March 2024, President Faure Gnassingbé presented a new constitution. One of the constitutional changes in the new constitution has Togo go from being under a presidential system to being under a parliamentary one, as well as weakening the power of the president, it becoming a mostly ceremonial role, strengthening the power of parliament, and strengthening the power of prime minister and renaming the office \"President of the Council of Ministers\" (French: Président du Conseil des Ministres). The term of the new office will be six years, renewable indefinitely, whereas the term of the president is lowered to four from the previous five, renewable once. In April 2024, the Togolese parliament voted in favour of the new constitution and the new constitution was officially adopted on 6 May 2024.[49]\n\nTogo is divided into 5 regions which are subdivided in turn into 39 prefectures. From north to south the regions are Savanes, Kara, Centrale, Plateaux and Maritime.\n\nWhile Togo's foreign policy is nonaligned, it has historical and cultural ties with western Europe, especially France and Germany. Togo recognizes the People's Republic of China, North Korea, and Cuba. It re-established relations with Israel in 1987. Togo pursues an active foreign policy and participates in international organizations. It is particularly active in West African regional affairs and in the African Union.\n\nIn 2017, Togo signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[50] Togo joined the Commonwealth of Nations, along with Gabon, at the 2022 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda.[26] In joining the Commonwealth, Foreign Minister Robert Dussey told Reuters, the country sought to expand its \"diplomatic, political and economic network\" and to \"forge closer ties with the anglophone world.\"[27]\n\nFAT (Forces armées togolaises, \"Togolese armed forces\"), consists of the army, navy, air force, and gendarmerie. Total military expenditures during the fiscal year of 2005 totalled 1.6% of the country's GDP.[2] Military bases exist in Lomé, Temedja, Kara, Niamtougou, and Dapaong.[51] The current Chief of the General Staff is Brigadier General Titikpina Atcha Mohamed, who took office on 19 May 2009.[52] The air force is equipped with Alpha jets.[53]\n\nTogo was labelled \"Not Free\" by Freedom House from 1972 to 1998 and from 2002 to 2006, and has been categorized as \"Partly Free\" from 1999 to 2001 and from 2007. According to a U.S. State Department report based on conditions in 2010, human rights problems include \"security force use of excessive force, including torture, which resulted in deaths and injuries; official impunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; lengthy pretrial detention; executive influence over the judiciary; infringement of citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on freedoms of press, assembly, and movement; official corruption; discrimination and violence against women; child abuse, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and sexual exploitation of children; regional and ethnic discrimination; trafficking in persons, especially women and children; societal discrimination against persons with disabilities; official and societal discrimination against homosexual persons; societal discrimination against persons with HIV; and forced labour, including by children.\"[54] Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Togo,[55] with a penalty of one to three years imprisonment.[56]\n\nIt has an area equal to 56,785 km2 (21,925 sq mi). It borders the Bight of Benin in the south; Ghana lies to the west; Benin to the east; and to the north, it is bound by Burkina Faso. North of the equator, it lies mostly between latitudes 6° and 11°N, and longitudes 0° and 2°E.\n\nThe coast of Togo in the Gulf of Guinea is 56 km (35 miles) long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches. In the north, the land is characterized by a rolling savanna in contrast to the centre of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a savanna and woodland plateau which reaches a coastal plain with lagoons and marshes. The highest mountain of the country is the Mont Agou at 986 metres (3235') above sea level. The longest river is the Mono River with a length of 400 km (250 miles). It runs from north to south.\n\nThe climate is \"generally tropical\"[14] with average temperatures ranging from 23 °C (73 °F) on the coast to about 30 °C (86 °F) in the northernmost regions, with a drier climate and characteristics of a tropical savanna.\n\nTogo contains three terrestrial ecoregions: Eastern Guinean forests, Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, and West Sudanian savanna.[57] The coast of Togo is characterized by marshes and mangroves. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.88/10, ranking it 92nd globally out of 172 countries.[58]\n\nAt least five parks and reserves have been established: Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve, Fazao Malfakassa National Park, Fosse aux Lions National Park, Koutammakou,[59] and Kéran National Park.\n\nThe country possesses phosphate deposits[14] and an export sector based on agricultural products such as coffee, cocoa bean, and peanuts (groundnuts), which together generate roughly 30% of export earnings.[14] Cotton is a cash crop.[60] The fertile land occupies 11.3% of the country, most of which is developed. Some crops are cassava, jasmine rice, maize and millet. Some other sectors are brewery and the textile industry. Low market prices for Togo's major export commodities coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and 2000s had a negative effect on the economy.[61]\n\nIt is listed in the least developed country group. It serves as a regional commercial and trade centre. The government's decade-long efforts supported by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to carry out economic reforms, to encourage investments, and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted economic activities in the country.[citation needed] Togo was ranked 117th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[62]\n\nIt imports machinery, equipment, petroleum products, and food. Its main import partners are France (21.1%), the Netherlands (12.1%), Côte d'Ivoire (5.9%), Germany (4.6%), Italy (4.4%), South Africa (4.3%) and China (4.1%). The main exports are cocoa, coffee, re-export of goods, phosphates and cotton. \"Major export partners\" are Burkina Faso (16.6%), China (15.4%), the Netherlands (13%), Benin (9.6%) and Mali (7.4%).\n\nIn terms of structural reforms, it has made progress in the liberalization of the economy, namely in the fields of trade and port activities. The privatization program of the cotton sector, telecommunications and water supply has stalled.\n\nOn 12 January 1994, the devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the armed forces, on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid and depressed cocoa prices generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999. Togo is a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).[63]\n\nAgriculture is the \"backbone\" of the economy.[14] A shortage of funds for the purchase of irrigation equipment and fertilizers has reduced agricultural output. Agriculture generated 28.2% of GDP in 2012 and employed 49% of the working population in 2010. The country is essentially self-sufficient in food production. Livestock production is dominated by cattle breeding.[64][65]\n\nMining generated about 33.9% of GDP in 2012 and employed 12% of the population in 2010. Togo's gold production in 2015 is 16 metric tons.[66] Togo has the fourth-largest phosphate deposits in the world. Their production is 2.1 million tons per year. There are reserves of limestone, marble and salt. Industry provides 20.4% of Togo's national income, as it consists of light industries and builders. Some reserves of limestone allows Togo to produce cement.[64][67]\n\nTogo has a road network of 7,520 km (4,670 mi) as of 2000, with no updated data as of 2023. It has only two major highways, Highway N1 and N2, connecting the capital, Lomé with the city of Dapaong, where it gets diverged northwards to Burkina Faso and from there north-west to Mali, and north-east to Niger. N1 is the longest highway of Togo, at a length of 613 km (381 mi). N2 connects Lomé with Aneho. The extension of N2 is Highway RNIE1, or the Trans–West African Coastal Highway, from Aneho to Cotonou in Benin. Other roads and highways are local and regional roads in the rest of the country, also passing through borders with the neighbouring countries. The Trans–West African Coastal Highway crosses Togo, connecting it to Benin and Nigeria to the east, and Ghana and Ivory Coast to the west. Once the construction in Liberia and Sierra Leone part gets completed, the highway will continue west to seven other Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) nations.\n\nTogo has a railway network of 568 km (353 mi) as of 2008, with no further updates in the network as of 2023. It follows a track gauge of 1,000 mm (3 ft 3+3⁄8 in) (narrow gauge) Trains are operated by Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Togolais (SNCT), which was established as a result of the restructuring and renaming of Réseau des Chemins de Fer du Togo from 1997 to 1998.[68] Between Hahotoé and the port of Kpémé, the Compagnie Togolaise des Mines du Bénin (CTMB) operated phosphate trains.[68]\n\nThe following are the railway networks present in the country:\n\nTogo has a total of eight airports, as of 2012, out of which two are international airports and six are domestic airports. The only major airport of the country is Lomé–Tokoin International Airport serving the capital, Lomé, and another Niamtougou International Airport in Niamtougou, serving the country's northern part.\n\nTogo, in terms of water transport, is only 50 km (31 mi) navigable, mostly seasonally on the Mono River, depending on rainfall, as of 2011. Togo has only one large container port for carrying trade operations in and out of the country, the Port of Lomé, in the capital.\n\nThe November 2010 census gave Togo a population of 6,191,155, more than double the total counted in the last census; in 2022 the Togo population was 8,680,832.[69] That census, taken in 1981, showed the nation had a population of 2,719,567. The capital, Lomé, grew from 375,499 in 1981 to 837,437 in 2010. When the urban population of surrounding Golfe prefecture is added, the Lomé Agglomeration contained 1,477,660 residents in 2010.[70][71]\n\nOther cities in Togo according to the new census were Sokodé (95,070), Kara (94,878), Kpalimé (75,084), Atakpamé (69,261), Dapaong (58,071) and Tsévié (54,474). With an estimated population of 8,644,829 (as of 2021 ), Togo is the 107th largest country by population. Most of the population (65%) live in rural villages dedicated to agriculture or pastures. The population of Togo shows a stronger growth: from 1961 (the year after independence) to 2003 it quintupled.[70][71]\n\nIn Togo, there are about 40 different ethnic groups, the most numerous of which are the Ewe in the south who make up 32% of the population. Along the southern coastline, they account for 21% of the population. Also found are Kotokoli or Tem and Tchamba in the centre and the Kabye people in the north (22%). The Ouatchis [fr] are 14% of the population. Sometimes the Ewes and Ouatchis are considered the same, while the French who studied both groups considered them different people.[73] Other ethnic groups include the Mina, Mossi, the Moba and Bassar, the Tchokossi of Mango (about 8%).\n\nAccording to a 2012 US government religious freedoms report, in 2004 the University of Lomé estimated that 33% of the population were traditional animists, 28% were Roman Catholic, 20% Sunni Muslim, 9% Protestant and another 5% belonged to other Christian denominations. The remaining 5% were reported to include persons not affiliated with any religious group. The report noted that \"many\" Christians and Muslims continue to perform indigenous religious practices.[75]\n\nIn 2023, The World Factbook stated that 42.3% of the population was Christian and 14% Muslim, with 36.9% being followers of indigenous beliefs, less than one percent being Hindus, Jews, and followers of other religions, and 6.2% being unaffiliated.[64]\n\nChristianity began to spread from the middle of the 15th century, after the arrival of Portuguese Catholic missionaries. Germans introduced Protestantism in the second half of the 19th century when a hundred missionaries of the Bremen Missionary Society were sent to the coastal areas of Togo and Ghana. Togo's Protestants were known as \"Brema\", a corruption of the word \"Bremen\". After World War I, German missionaries had to leave, which gave birth to the early autonomy of the Ewe Evangelical Church.[76]\n\nIn 2022, Freedom House rated Togo's religious freedom as 3 out of 4,[77] noting that religious freedom is constitutionally protected and generally respected in practice. Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism are recognised by the state; other groups must register as religious associations to receive similar benefits. The registration process has been subject to long delays with almost 900 applications pending at the beginning of 2021.\n\nAccording to Ethnologue, 39 distinct languages are spoken in the country, some of them by communities that number fewer than 100,000 members.[78] Of the 39 languages, the sole official language is French.[79] Two spoken indigenous languages were designated politically as national languages in 1975: Ewé (Ewe: Èʋegbe; French: Evé) and Kabiyé.[79]\n\nThough not native to most groups, French is used in formal education, legislature, all forms of media, administration and commerce. Ewe is a language of wider communication in the south. Tem functions to a limited extent as a trade language in some northern towns.[80] Officially, Ewe and Kabiye are \"national languages\", which in the Togolese context means languages that are promoted in formal education and used in the media. Others are Gen, Aja, Moba, Ntcham, and Ife. In joining the Commonwealth, the Togolese government has anticipated opportunities for Togolese citizens to learn English.[27]\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative[81] finds that Togo is fulfilling 73.1% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to health based on its level of income.[82] When looking at the right to health with respect to children, Togo achieves 93.8% of what is expected based on its current income.[82] In regards to the right to health amongst the adult population, the country achieves 88.2% of what is expected based on the nation's level of income.[82] It falls into the \"very bad\" category when evaluating the right to reproductive health because the nation is fulfilling 37.3% of what the nation is expected to achieve based on the resources (income) it has available.[82]\n\nHealth expenditure in Togo was 5.2% of GDP in 2014, which ranks the country in 45th place in the world.[64] The infant mortality rate is approximately 43.7 deaths per 1,000 children in 2016.[64] Male life expectancy at birth was at 62.3 in 2016, whereas it was at 67.7 years for females.[64] There were 5 physicians per 100,000 people in 2008[64] According to a 2013 UNICEF report,[83] 4% of women in Togo have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nAs of 2015 , the maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Togo is 368, compared with 350 in 2010 and 539.7 in 1990.[64] The under 5 mortality rate per 1,000 births is 100, and the neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 32. In Togo the number of midwives per 1,000 live births is 2 and the lifetime risk of death for pregnant women is 1 in 67.[84]\n\nIn 2016, Togo had 4100 (2400-6100) new HIV infections and 5100 (3100-7700) AIDS-related deaths. There were 100,000 (73,000-130,000) people living with HIV in 2016, among whom 51% (37-67%) were accessing antiretroviral therapy. Among pregnant women living with HIV, 86% (59% - >95%) were accessing treatment or prophylaxis to prevent transmission of HIV to their children. An estimated <1000 (<500-1400) children were newly infected with HIV due to mother-to-child transmission. Among people living with HIV, approximately 42% (30-55%) had suppressed viral loads.[85]\n\nAFD is working to enhance living conditions in Lomé, the coastal city with a population of 1.4 million, by modernizing solid waste management services. The project involves enhancing garbage collection through the construction of a new landfill that meets international standards.[86][87]\n\nIn 2024, a Universal Health Insurance program was launched, covering 800,000 people within six months and implemented through the National Social Security Fund and the National Health Insurance Institute.[88]\n\nEducation in Togo is compulsory for six years.[89] In 1996, the gross primary enrollment rate was 119.6%, and the net primary enrollment rate was 81.3%.[89] In 2011, the net enrollment rate was 94%. The education system has \"suffered from teacher shortages, lower educational quality in rural areas, and high repetition and dropout rates\".[89]\n\nThe culture reflects the influences of ethnic groups, the largest of which are the Ewe, Mina, Tem, Tchamba and Kabre. Some people follow native animistic practices and beliefs.\n\nEwe statuary is characterized by its statuettes which illustrate the worship of the ibeji. Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the \"more ubiquitous\" African masks. The wood-carvers of Kloto has their \"chains of marriage\": Two characters are connected by rings whittled from one piece of wood.\n\nThe dyed fabric batiks of the artisanal centre of Kloto represent stylized and coloured scenes of ancient everyday life. There are loincloths used in the ceremonies of the weavers of Assahoun. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the \"immense arid extents, swept by the dry wind\", and where the soil keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician Paul Ahyi practiced the \"zota\", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate Lomé.\n\nBasketball is Togo's \"second most practiced sport\".[90] Togo featured a national team in beach volleyball that competed at the 2018–2020 CAVB Beach Volleyball Continental Cup in the men's section.[91]\n\nMass media in Togo includes radio, television, and online and print formats. The Agence Togolaise de Presse [fr] news agency began in 1975.[92] The Union des Journalistes Independants du Togo press association is headquartered in Lomé.[92]Togolese Television is the state-owned service.Togo country profile: Faure Gnassingbe Eyadema succeeded his father, who died in 2005 after ruling the country with an iron fist for 38 years.\n\nThe military installed Faure Gnassingbe as president, but after demonstrations and protests in which hundreds died, as well as international pressure, he held an election in April 2005 that he subsequently won.\n\nGnassingbe was re-elected in 2010, 2015 and 2020. All of the elections have been criticised by the opposition, who have alleged instances of widespread fraud.\n\nIn 2024, Togo's parliament gave final approval to a new constitution extending the president's term. The country will move from a presidential to a parliamentary system.\n\nPresident Gnassingbé's supporters argue the changes reduce his powers by transforming the presidency into a ceremonial role.\n\nCritics have denounced the move as a coup, arguing that the reforms remove limits on his stay in office and their removal enables him to remain president until 2031, after which he could be appointed to the new position of \"president of the council of ministers\", in effect prime minister."}

Quan Àrtemis i els seus companys a Letrinos van anar cap a Alfeu, ella va sospitar dels seus motius i es va cobrir la cara amb fang perquè no la reconegués. En una altra història, Alfeu intenta violar l'assistent d'Àrtemis, Aretusa . Àrtemis es compadeix de la noia i la salva, transformant-la en una font al temple Artemis Alphaea de Letrinos, on van beure la deessa i la seva assistent.\n\nSe li atribueix la mort de Cal·listo , que va morir per una fletxa perquè Hera ho va demanar o per castigar-la per haver-se deixat seduir per Zeus quan Cal·listo va ser transformada en ossa.\n\nEntre les seves víctimes trobem Orió , el caçador gegant. Les tradicions difereixen sobre el motiu de la deessa per matar-lo. Unes diuen que Orió va fer entrar en còlera a Àrtemis per haver-la desafiat en el llançament del disc, o bé altres expliquen que Orió va voler raptar una de les companyes d'Àrtemis, Opis, a qui ella havia fet venir del país dels hiperboris . O també es deia que Orió va intentar violar la mateixa Àrtemis, i per això la deessa li va enviar un escorpí que el va picar i el va matar.\n\nEls fills bessons de Posidó i Ifimedia , Otos i Efialtes , van créixer enormement a una edat jove. Eren uns caçadors agressius i hàbils que no podien ser assassinats excepte entre ells. El creixement dels aloïdes no es va aturar mai, i van presumir que tan bon punt poguessin arribar al cel, segrestarien Àrtemis i Hera i les prendrien com a dones. Els déus els tenien por, llevat d'Àrtemis que va capturar un cabirol que va saltar entre ells i es van matar intentant caçar-lo. [21]\n\nÀrtemis va salvar l'infant Atalanta de morir per hipotèrmia després que el seu pare l'abandonés. Va enviar una óssa per alletar el nadó, que després va ser criat pels caçadors. En algunes històries, Àrtemis després va enviar un ós per ferir Atalanta perquè d'altres afirmaven que Atalanta era una caçadora superior. Entre altres aventures, Atalanta va participar en la caça del senglar de Calidó , que Àrtemis havia enviat per destruir Calidó perquè el rei Eneu l'havia oblidat en els sacrificis de la collita .\n\nQuan la flota grega es preparava a Àulida per marxar cap a Troia per començar la guerra, Àrtemis va calmar els vents. El vident Calcant va aconsellar erròniament a Agamèmnon que l'única manera d'apaivagar Àrtemis era sacrificar la seva filla Ifigenia. En alguna versió del mite, Àrtemis va arrabassar Ifigenia de l'altar i la va substituir per un cérvol; en altres, Àrtemis va permetre que es sacrifiqués Ifigenia. En les versions on Ifigenia va sobreviure, s'han explicat diversos mites sobre el que va passar després que Àrtemis la prengués; o bé la van portar a Taures i la va portar als sacerdots, o es va convertir en la companya immortal d'Àrtemis.[45] Enees també va ser ajudat per Àrtemis, Leto i Apol·lo. Apol·lo el va trobar ferit per Diomedes i el va aixecar al cel. Allà, les tres divinitats el van curar en secret en una gran cambra.\n\nDurant la teomàquia, Àrtemis es va trobar davant d'Hera, sobre la qual un escoli a la Ilíada va escriure que representaven la Lluna enfront de l'aire al voltant de la Terra.[46] Àrtemis va renyar al seu germà Apol·lo per no lluitar contra Posidó i li va dir que no tornés a presumir mai més; Apol·lo no li va respondre. Una enfadada Hera va retreure a Àrtemis per haver-se atrevit a lluitar amb ella. Llavors Hera va agafar les mans d'Artemisa pels canells i, subjectant-la, la va colpejar amb el seu propi arc.[47] Plorant, Àrtemis va deixar l'arc i les fletxes on estaven i va córrer cap a l'Olimp per plorar als genolls del seu pare Zeus, mentre la seva mare Leto agafava l'arc i les fletxes i seguia la seva filla plorant.[48]"}

The average elevation is 338 m, with a minimum of 20 m and a maximum of 533 m. Favara is part of the agricultural region #5 Agrigento seaside hills (Italian: Colline litoranee di Agrigento). The local climate falls into the Csa category of the Köppen climate classification, i.e. a warm Mediterranean climate with hot and dry summers and temperate winters, with temperature rarely dropping below 0 °C.\n\nThe first signs of human habitation of the area can be dated to the late copper age (2400-1990 a.C.), with monochrome red pottery in the Malpasso style found in a cave in contrada Ticchiara. An excavation of a later burial site (1900-1450 a.C.) from contrada Grazia Vicina has yielded gray achromatic ceramic with connection to the Conca d'Oro style (late copper age in the Palermo region) and to archaic forms of the Castelluccio style (early Bronze Age in central-southern Sicily). Another burial site has been identified in contrada San Vincenzo, which can be dated to the middle Bronze Age (around 1450 a.C.).\n\nRemains of a fortification dating to the period of the Greek colonies in Sicily can be found in Contrada Caltafaraci. Following the Roman and Byzantine domination, the Saracen established themselves in Sicily in the 9th and 10th century. A settlement flourished in contrada Saraceno and many traces of their domination can still be found in the denomination of local geographical places. The name of the town itself originates from the Arabian fawwāra (Arabic: ﻓﻮﺍﺭة), meaning \"Gurgling pool of water\".[4]\n\nDuring the subsequent Norman domination several large structures were built, among others the Chiaramonte Castle, also known as the Medieval Palace. In the 14th century the castle passed to the Chiaramonte family, from which it took its current name. In the 15th century, although protected by city walls, the town underwent a period of population decline, especially between 1439 and 1464. This trend was reversed from 1478 to 1497. In the 16th century the efforts of the De Marinis family contributed to a greater development of Favara.\n\nIn the 19th century, in the background of the unification of Italy and up to 1883, Favara was the main hub of a large criminal organization known as Fratellanza di Favara.\n\nIn contemporary history, the mayor of Favara, Gaetano Guarino, was murdered on May 16, 1946, by unknown perpetrators.\n\nCalogero Marrone (1889-1945), Righteous Among the Nations, was born and raised in Favara.\n\nThe town possesses a Castle of the 11th- to 15th-century noble Chiaramonte family, erected in 1280.[3]Jeremiah Favara, Ph.D.: Monday: 10:00am - 11:00am\n\n Wednesday: 9:00am - 11:00am\n\n Thursday: 10:00am to 11:00am\n\n or by appointmentPresident Favara: Dr. Favara first became acquainted with Central Christian College of Kansas when he attended Central College as a student in 1987. During that time, he was a member of the Cross Country team and served on Student Government as the Christian Life Director. He graduated both with an Associate of Arts and a Bachelor of Science in Ministry.\n\nOver the past 20 years, Favara has served under a number of titles including Coach, Dean, Professor, Pastor, Provost, and now President. During that time, Favara also completed a Master of Science from Kansas State University and then went on to complete a Doctorate in Philosophy in Psychology, with a specialization in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, from Northcentral University in Scottsdale, AZ.\n\nIn the local community, “Lenny” has been a proud supporter of McPherson and the surrounding area. Currently, he serves on the Hospital Board and the United Way Board. Though, if asked, he would tell you that some of his most enjoyable memories stem from his time with the McPherson Community Theatre directing such favorites as Wizard of Oz, My Fair Lady, Honk, and Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat. When not directing from behind the scenes, you may find him down at the Cosmosphere where he volunteers in the education department.\n\nDemonstrating a deep commitment to student success and a great appreciation for the college’s historical context and mission, Dr. Favara is passionate about guiding the college and preparing it for its next 135 years of service. His first year at the helm has been one defined by growth, excitement, and service.\n\nDr. Favara is married to Dr. Deanna (Martin) Favara, daughter of Kenneth, CC’61, and Vida Martin. Having served in a number of roles at Central Christian including Administrative Assistant to Student Development, Resident Director Online Instructor, and Director of Dual-Credit, “Dea” now looks forward to serving the campus community as First Lady. Having met at Central Christian, the two recently celebrated their 30th anniversary. They have two children: Jeremiah & Joseph.Giovanni Favara: Please enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser or access the information through the links provided below."}

El plumaje, muy denso, presenta una coloración marrón oscura en las regiones dorsales y blancuzca en las ventrales (dibujo 1). Similar en ambos sexos, sufre algunas variaciones a lo largo del año y en los individuos juveniles. En plumaje invernal, la cabeza muestra las mejillas y la garganta de color blanco sobre el que destaca una tenue franja oscura que corre a partir del ojo (dibujo 2). Algunas aves muestran un anillo ocular blanco, que resalta vivamente sobre el tono oscuro de la cabeza y que se prolonga en una delgada línea blanca por detrás del ojo. Los ejemplares que presentan este diseño reciben el nombre de araos bridados. Como otros álcidos, el arao desarrolla un vuelo muy directo mediante rápidos aleteos (dibujo 3).\n\nHasta los años sesenta del pasado siglo se contaba con una población nidificante relativamente importante, que se reproducía en las islas y acantilados del litoral gallego. En la actualidad, las dos colonias de arao común que existían en Galicia en el II Atlas de aves reproductoras (1998-2002, Martí y Del Moral, 2003), han desaparecido y aparentemente la especie ya no se reproduce en España. Sí es posible avistar la especie en los pasos y la invernada, cuando nos visitan aves del norte de Europa para alimentarse mar adentro en litoral cantábrico y atlántico gallego. Para más información sobre su distribución territorial y otros datos de interés, consulta la ficha del arao común en el III Atlas de las aves en época de reproducción en España.\n\nEl arao común muestra un comportamiento básicamente dispersivo, en especial los jóvenes, que pueden llegar a realizar desplazamientos de cierta relevancia que los llevan a recalar en localidades bastante alejadas de sus lugares de cría, como lo demuestra el hecho de que se registren aves inmaduras procedentes de las islas Británicas en las costas cantábricas y atlánticas de la Península durante el invierno. Los adultos, sin embargo, permanecen a lo largo de la estación desfavorable en las cercanías de las colonias de cría.\n\nLa Lista Roja Europea de Aves 2021 estima una población europea de entre 3 y 4,4 millones de individuos, con tendencia creciente. España albergaba hasta los años sesenta del pasado siglo unos 3.000 ejemplares, distribuidos en ocho localidades de cría. Tras una disminución espectacular, en 1990 quedaban tan solo 10 parejas reproductoras. En la actualidad la población reproductora está prácticamente extinta, siendo los indicios de reproducción muy débiles y aislados.\n\nSe alimenta de una gran variedad de peces pequeños y medianos (arenques, sardinas, boquerones, fanecas), que localiza mientras prospecta el agua con la cabeza sumergida hasta detectar algún banco; en ese momento se zambulle y, tras una persecución, captura su presa, a la que engulle antes de subir a la superficie. Durante el periodo reproductor, el ave transporta el pez hasta el nido para alimentar a su único pollo.\n\nCría en nutridas colonias junto a otras especies de aves marinas en acantilados costeros, donde utiliza los mismos emplazamientos de unas temporadas a otras. Al inicio del periodo reproductor, los machos, tras pasar todo el invierno en el mar, toman posesión de algún lugar apropiado para criar, generalmente a escasa distancia de sus vecinos, en espera de la llegada de su compañera. No construye nido, sino que utiliza las repisas de los acantilados, la superficie de rocas planas y grietas o cuevecillas entre las rocas, en las que, a lo sumo, deposita algunas pequeñas piedras. La puesta consta de un solo huevo grande y piriforme (para evitar que ruede), de superficie rugosa y color variable (blanco, azul, verde, crema o pardo), sin manchas o con motas o listas. Para incubarlo, ambos adultos lo mantienen entre las patas y el vientre a lo largo de 28-35 días. El pollo es atendido por sus padres durante unos 14-20 días desde su nacimiento, que resulta bastante sincrónico con respecto a los del resto de la colonia para favorecer el éxito reproductor. Transcurrido este tiempo, el pequeño arao tendrá que superar una prueba crucial, que consiste en lanzarse al mar desde la repisa del acantilado donde nació. El padre, que vigila la maniobra, se lanza a continuación y, una vez juntos, se dirigen mar adentro nadando o buceando. Durante algún tiempo más, el padre se encarga de facilitar alimento y protección al joven arao, hasta que alcance su desarrollo completo y se independice.\n\nMeses en los que se puede ver la especie en España\n\nLa especie se incluye en el Libro Rojo de las Aves de España 2021 en la categoría de CR – En peligro crítico. También aparece en el Catálogo Nacional de Especies Amenazadas como EN – En peligro de Extinción como reproductora. La población de arao común ha experimentado un acusado descenso en casi toda su área de distribución europea, como consecuencia de las actuaciones humanas. Por lo que respecta a España, la situación de la población reproductora es crítica. Los últimos indicios de cría en las islas Sisargas son del 2004, y en los islotes del cabo Vilán del 2013 cuando se observaron tres aves en época de cría. En 2017 se realizó un trabajo específico de censo y no se observaron araos en ninguna de las dos localidades. En las islas Berlangas, en las que a mediados de siglo XX las parejas se contabilizaban por miles, ha desaparecido por completo. El declive de la especie se ha debido a diversas causas, entre las que destacan la mortalidad por artes de pesca, la desaparición de la anchoa —uno de los peces más importante en su dieta— por sobrepesca y la contaminación por petróleo.

Il s’engage, à l’âge de seize ans, dans l’armée et sert trois ans en Dalmatie.\n\nRentré à Venise, il se bâtit bientôt une réputation d’homme d’esprit grâce, notamment, à la publication de plusieurs pièces satiriques qui font de lui l’un des membres les plus distingués de la société savante et joyeuse des Granelleschi (les Ineptes). Cette société, attachée en principe à la convivialité et aux mots d’esprit, a de grandes ambitions littéraires et s’attache, tout particulièrement, à préserver la littérature toscane des influences étrangères.\n\nLe déclin de la comédie italienne, la commedia dell'arte en vogue pendant plus de trois siècles dans toute la péninsule, au profit des drames de Pietro Chiari et des œuvres réalistes de Carlo Goldoni, imités du théâtre français, menace de ruiner les efforts de la société ; en 1757, Gozzi se porte à son secours en imaginant de mettre à la scène les contes féeriques tirés de vieux recueils populaires, tels que Lo Cunto del li Cunti. Il publie un poème satirique, La Tartana degli influssi per l’anno 1756, et, en 1761, une comédie, L’Amour des trois oranges ou Analisi riflessiva della fiaba L’amore delle tre melarance, une parodie dans la manière de ses deux concurrents, fondée sur une intrigue féerique, où les masques font leur réapparition. Pour les jouer, il obtient les services de la compagnie de comédiens Sacchi, qui, à cause de la popularité des comédies de Chiari et de Goldoni - qui ne correspond pas à leur style de jeu - se trouvait sans emploi. Leur force satirique, aiguisée par une inimitié personnelle, fit de la pièce un extraordinaire succès, contraignant Goldoni à venir en France trouver un public.\n\nMotivé par l’effet qu’a produit l’introduction du surnaturel ou d’éléments mythiques pourtant simplement employés pour leur potentiel satirique, Gozzi crée une série de neuf fables. Dans ses textes, il ne trace que l’intrigue, et laisse le dialogue à l’improvisation. Ses pièces laissent souvent une place importante à la fantaisie et au fantastique. Ses œuvres restent celles d’un aristocrate cultivé dont les fables ont finalement été oubliées. Gozzi a écrit, pour le théâtre de Venise, dix comédies fiabesques ou Fables théâtrales. Outre L’Amour des trois oranges (1761), peuvent être énumérés les titres suivants : Le Corbeau, en cinq actes (1761) ; Le Roi Cerf, en trois actes (1762) ; Turandot, fable tragi-comique en cinq actes (1762) ; La Femme serpent (1762) ; La Zobéide (1763) ; Les Mendiants fortunés (1764) ; Le Monstre bleu, en cinq actes (1764)[1] ; L’Oiseau vert (1765) ; Zéïm, roi des Génies (1765). Ces pièces est sont en vers, en dehors de la première.\n\nVers la fin de sa vie, Gozzi écrit des tragédies comprenant une dimension comique : innovation si mal accueillie par les critiques que le dramaturge se tourne vers le drame espagnol, qui lui sert de modèle pour plusieurs pièces, au succès mineur. Avec des ouvrages d’une certaine diversité, Gozzi plut par l’esprit, la verve et l’habileté. Forcé de conserver les vieux types représentant les diverses nationalités italiennes : Pantalon le Vénitien, Tartaglia le Napolitain, Brighella le Bergamasque, etc., il leur donne des rôles de généraux, d’ambassadeurs, de ministres, où ils portent leur bonhomie habituelle, et sauvent les situations par leur gaieté. Parmi ces comédies, L’Amour des trois oranges est surtout remarquable comme protestation et satire littéraire. Turandot, princesse de la Chine, dont le sujet est étrange, mais non féerique, a été traduit par Schiller et souvent jouée en Allemagne avec le même succès qu’elle obtint à Venise au théâtre San-Samuel. L’accueil favorable fait à des compositions qui semblent le produit d’une littérature retournant à l'émerveillement de l'enfance s’explique par la réaction, dont Gozzi donne le signal, contre la comédie larmoyante ou commedia fiebile, importée de France en Italie, par Goldoni et Chiari.\n\nGozzi est encore auteur d’une vingtaine de comédies, la plupart d’imitation espagnole, empruntées à José de Cordova, Matos Fragoso, Calderón, Moreto y Cavana, Cañizares, Rojas, Tirso de Molina. L’une de ces pièces, La Vedova del Malabar, est tirée de la tragédie française de Lemierre. Les Œuvres de Gozzi comprennent en outre Marfisa bisarra, une composition romanesque en douze chants et en octaves, prétendument tirée de la Chronique du Pseudo-Turpin ; un poème moral et satirique de 700 vers intitulé : Astrazione ; une traduction en vers élégants, non rimés, des Satires de Boileau ; divers morceaux critiques ou académiques en vers ou en prose.\n\nUn peu oubliées dans sa patrie, les comédies fiabesques de Gozzi sont connues en France par la traduction de M. A. Royer de cinq d’entre elles : Le Corbeau, Le Roi Cerf, Turandot, en vers ; La Zobéide, L’Oiselet vert (Paris, 1865, in-12)[2]. Prisé de Goethe, Schlegel, Germaine de Staël, Sismondi et Schiller (qui a traduit Turandot), le théâtre de Gozzi connaît un immense retentissement parmi les romantiques allemands. E.T.A. Hoffmann le cite expressément comme un modèle dans La Princesse Brambilla.\n\nDes compositeurs se sont inspirés de Gozzi pour leurs livrets d'opéra :\n• L’Amour des trois oranges (1761), la plus célèbre des pièces de Gozzi (elle-même basée sur le conte des Trois cédrats, de Giambattista Basile), a inspiré Sergueï Prokofiev pour son opéra du même nom (1921) ;\n• La Femme Serpent (1762) a inspiré Richard Wagner pour son opéra de jeunesse Les Fées (1834) et Alfredo Casella pour son opéra La donna serpente (1932) ;\n• Turandot (1762) a inspiré Ferruccio Busoni (1917) et Giacomo Puccini (1926) pour leurs opéras du même nom.\n• Le Corbeau, deuxième fable théâtrale de Gozzi (1761), a inspiré Hans Christian Andersen et le compositeur danois Johann Peter Emilius Hartmann pour son opéra Ravnen, en trois actes, créé en 1832 à Copenhague, révisé en 1859 et 1863.\n• Le Roi Cerf a inspiré Hans Werner Henze pour son opéra König Hirsch (1956).\n\nGozzi a réalisé lui-même une édition de ses Œuvres (Venise, 1772, 8 vol. in-8° ; supplément, 1791, 2 vol.), suivie d’une édition en 10 volumes (Venise, 1792). Il a également laissé de très intéressants Mémoires inutiles. Il est également traducteur. Il commence par traduire le roman de Marivaux Le Pharsamon ou les nouvelles folies romanesques, sous le titre Il Farsamone, publié sans nom de traducteur en 1751, pour perfectionner son français.

Ces ouvrages n'ont jamais été traduits dans notre langue, car ils sont écrits pour partie en dialecte vénitien. […] Gozzi méritait bien, comme on dit, les honneurs d'une traduction… » Alphonse Royer avait raison de se lancer en 1865 dans la traduction de cinq des dix fables du comte Carlo Gozzi sous le titre Théâtre fiabesque : il s'agit d’un genre totalement nouveau, inventé par Gozzi pour triompher de son rival honni, Carlo Goldoni, où il mêle avec bonheur le tragique, le pathétique et le comique, dans des intrigues merveilleuses tirées des contes de nourrices. Mais la traduction de ces fables théâtrales ne va pas de soi : car, outre les difficultés posées par le dialecte vénitien, le traducteur est confronté à une « écriture-centaure » mise au point par l’auteur dans la première édition de 1772, où les scènes entièrement dialoguées, en prose en et en vers, en italien et en dialecte, alternent avec des scènes-canevas propres au jeu improvisé des acteurs italiens. Les traductions destinées à la scène ne peuvent jamais restituer cette particularité de l’original, seule une traduction à lire peut lui rendre justice. C’est le but que se fixe cette traduction de la neuvième fable gozzienne, la plus aboutie, L’Oiseau vert (1765), où l’auteur se plaît à donner une suite aux aventures racontées dans la première, L’Amour des trois oranges (1761).Turandot (Busoni) — Wikipédia: Turandot (BV 273 (en)) est un opéra en deux actes avec dialogues parlés de Ferruccio Busoni (1917). Le compositeur rédigea son propre livret en allemand en s'inspirant de la pièce Turandot (en) du comte Carlo Gozzi. La musique de l'opéra repose sur la musique de scène et la suite (en) (BV 248) connexe que Busoni a composées en 1905 pour une production de la pièce de Gozzi. L'opéra est souvent interprété avec l'opéra en un acte précédent de Busoni, Arlecchino.\n\nLa pièce Turandot (en) de Carlo Gozzi fut jouée la première fois en 1762. Elle est créée à l'origine pour être représentée dans le petit théâtre San Samuele de Venise et écrite délibérément dans le style de la commedia dell'arte en réaction aux pièces réalistes plus modernes de Goldoni et d'autres[1].\n\nSchiller fait une traduction adaptée de Turandot qui est publiée en 1802[2]. Weber compose, en 1809, sa musique de scène Turandot, Op. 37, pour une production de cette pièce. Il y inclut l'Overtura cinese (ouverture chinoise), qu'il a composée sur un thème chinois en 1805. Busoni pense qu'à eux deux, Schiller et Weber ont ruiné un chef-d'œuvre de la littérature italienne[3].\n\nSous une forme ou une autre, le Turandot de Gozzi occupe Busoni à divers moments entre 1904 et 1917. Il aime beaucoup les contes fantastiques et magiques : son œuvre précédente est le Concerto pour piano (en), op. 39, BV247, qui comprend de la musique d'une adaptation inachevée de l'Aladdin d'Oehlenschlager[4].\n\nEn 1904, Busoni commence à ébaucher de la musique de scène pour la fable chinoise de Gozzi. Il arrange aussi une suite, qu'il interprète la première fois en 1905 et publie en 1906. La pièce de Gozzi est montée avec la musique de Busoni par Max Reinhardt à Berlin en 1911, et à Londres en 1913[5].\n\nAprès le déclenchement de la Première Guerre mondiale, Busoni, étant Italien, trouve de plus en plus difficile de rester à Berlin et finit par déménager à Zurich, où il n'a pas à prendre parti. De la fin de 1915 au mois d' , il est occupé à écrire son opéra en un acte, Arlecchino, mais le Stadttheater de Zurich ne veut pas monter une production sans pièce d'accompagnement. Il écrit rapidement un livret en allemand inspiré de la pièce de Gozzi et adapte sa suite Turandot en court opéra en deux actes avec dialogues parlés[6]. Le , Busoni écrit à Egon Petri :\n\n« La question importante de savoir quelle pièce je devrais combiner avec l'opéra Arlecchino d'une durée d'une heure pour remplir une soirée, mes ennuis qui en ont résulté et le désir d'établir un programme durablement valable m'ont amené à décider hâtivement de composer un opéra en deux actes à partir de la matière et du fond de Turandot. Depuis quelques semaines, j'ai travaillé dur à cette tâche délicieuse, écrivant le livret et la musique d'un opéra sur Turandot. Je récris le texte entièrement et indépendamment pour en rapprocher le ton de celui d'une pantomime ou d'une pièce de théâtre. C'est un travail plus ardu que je ne me l'imaginais, mais je me sens inspiré. Les personnages masqués communs aux deux œuvres servent à les lier (sinon, ils tranchent complètement les uns sur les autres)[7]. »\n\nBusoni termine l'opéra Turandot en vitesse (300 pages en 100 jours) à la fin de 1916 et en dirige la première avec Arlecchino à Zurich en 1917. Dent mentionne que Busoni était satisfait de son travail[6].\n\nLe livret de Busoni comprend diverses bizarreries qui rappellent qu'il provient de la commedia dell'arte : des personnages portent des noms italiens tels que Truffaldino et Pantalone, Allah est loué en Chine, et il y a des mentions de Venise, de la basilique Saint-Marc et de gondoles. Le dialogue parlé remonte aux opéras de Mozart, notamment à La Flûte enchantée[8]. En comparaison du Turandot un peu épiquement boursouflé de Puccini, l'œuvre de Busoni l'esthète conserve l'atmosphère irréel, intime, de la pièce de Gozzi[9]. La princesse Turandot de Busoni n'est pas aussi implacable ; son cœur est plus prêt à fondre.\n\nBusoni réutilisa une partie du matériel qu'il avait composé pour l'opéra : il révisa à nouveau la suite orchestrale Turandot en 1917 en remplaçant la marche funèbre du dernier mouvement par l'Avertissement d'Altoum (BV 248b[5]) et il publia séparément Altoums Gebet de l'acte 2 (écrit pour l'opéra) sous forme de la Prière d'Altoum pour baryton et petit orchestre, op. 49 1, BV 277.\n\nLa première de Turandot de Busoni a lieu avec celle de son Arlecchino le au Stadttheater de Zurich. Le producteur est Hans Rogorsch, et le décorateur, Albert Isler[10]. Turandot et Arlecchino ont leur première en Allemagne le à l'opéra de Francfort sous la direction de Gustav Brecher[11], et sont repris le à l'opéra de Cologne sous la direction d'Otto Klemperer, qui vient d'y être nommé premier chef[12]. Les deux opéras sont interprétés à l'opéra de Berlin le sous la direction ferme du chef d'orchestre wagnérien Leo Blech (en) et y connaissent un grand succès[13].\n\nLa première interprétation de Turandot en Italie (sans Arlecchino) a lieu le à Rome sous la direction de Fernando Previtali. Chantre de Busoni, Previtali, continue de diriger l'œuvre dans d'autres villes italiennes avant d'en diriger la première au théâtre Colón de Buenos Aires en 1964.\n\nLa première en Angleterre a lieu à Londres le dans une traduction anglaise de Lionel Salter. Elle est radiodiffusée à l'émission BBC Third Programme de la BBC.\n\nLa première américaine a lieu sous forme d'opéra concert au Philharmonic Hall de New York le . Elle est suivie d'une version mise partiellement en scène à la First Presbyterian Church de Berkeley le sous la direction de Kent Nagano, âgé de 28 ans. Une interprétation de l'œuvre avec mise en scène complète est donnée le par le Connecticut Grand Opera (en) à Stamford. Gregory Stapp (en) y joue l'empereur Altoum ; Juan Luque Carmona, Kalaf ; et Patricia Craig (en), le rôle-titre[11].\n\nTrois flûtes (la troisième doublant le piccolo), trois hautbois (le troisième doublant le cor anglais), trois clarinettes (la troisième doublant une clarinette basse), trois bassons (le troisième doublant le contrebasson), quatre cors d'harmonie, quatre trompettes, trois trombones, un tuba ; percussion (timbales, glockenspiel, triangle, tambourin, covered drum⇔tambour voilé, grosse caisse, gong) ; deux harpes ; solistes, chœur ; cordes[5],[14],[15].\n\nBusoni simplifia beaucoup la pièce en cinq actes de Gozzi pour en faire un opéra en deux actes composés de deux scènes chacun[16]. L'intrigue de base reste toutefois la même. Turandot, fille de l'empereur, défie tous ceux qui désirent l'épouser de résoudre trois énigmes. Elle épousera celui qui y parviendra, mais ceux qui échoueront seront exécutés. Kalaf, prince déguisé en exil, relève le défi.\n\nKalaf tombe sur l'image abandonnée par un prétendant exécuté et décide d'obtenir la main de Turandot.\n\nL'empereur Altoum se plaint de l'intransigeance de Turandot. Kalaf dit qu'il préfère mourir s'il échoue. Turandot entre avec sa servante Adelma, qui reconnaît le prétendant mais garde le silence. Kalaf répond bien aux trois énigmes et défie Turandot de découvrir son nom et ses origines ; si elle réussit, il partira.\n\nLes jeunes filles esclaves dansent sur une version chorale sans mot de Greensleeves[17]. Turandot avoue les sentiments mitigés qu'elle éprouve envers le prince. Adelma lui dit qu'elle connaît le nom de ce dernier et qu'elle le lui révélera en échange de sa liberté ; Turandot accepte.\n\nTurandot révèle le nom du prince en répandant la consternation, et Kalaf s'apprête à partir, mais Turandot l'arrête en lui disant qu'il a éveillé son cœur. L'œuvre se termine par l'ensemble Was ist das alle Menschen bindet? (qu'est-ce qui gouverne tous les hommes ?), question à laquelle la réponse est : Die Liebe (l'amour).\n• Arlecchino et Turandot - Chœur et orchestre de l'Opéra de Lyon 18\n• Turandot - Orchestre symphonique de la radio de Berlin 19\n• Cet article est partiellement ou en totalité issu de l’article de Wikipédia en anglais intitulé .\n• None William et Harold , Puccini's Turandot : The End of the Great Tradition , Princeton, , 193 (ISBN , .\n• None Kii-Ming , Ping, Pong, Pang.

Though reputed to be staunchly dedicated to the worship of the Old Norse gods, they would allegedly fight for any lord who could pay their substantial fees, even if he were Christian. The institution of the Jomsvikings would itself foreshadow those of the later religious and chivalric orders of the Middle Ages.[1]\n\nThe legend of the Jomsvikings appears in some of the Icelandic sagas from the 12th and 13th centuries. According to the sagas (particularly the Jómsvíkinga saga, King Olaf Tryggvasson’s Saga, and stories found in the Flatey Book), their stronghold of Jomsborg was located on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, but its exact location has been disputed by modern historians and archeologists. Jomsborg is also thought by some researchers to be identical with Jumne, Julin and Vineta, which are mentioned in both Danish and German records from the Middle Ages.[2][3][4][5] There is no medieval source that mentions a precise location of Jomsborg except for the disputed Gesta Wulinensis ecclesiae pontificum (at 53°51′50″N 14°43′05″E﻿ / ﻿53.86389°N 14.71806°E﻿ / 53.86389; 14.71806) that was alleged to have been discovered in the autumn of 2019.[6][7][8]\n\nHistorians still debate the accuracy of the accounts of the Jomsvikings. Without a conclusively identified location for their headquarters, and because of a lack of primary or contemporary sources specifically mentioning the Jomsvikings or Jomsborg, confirming the tales of their exploits has been difficult. However, there are three contemporary runestones, as well as passages in Old Norse poetry and the lausavísur, that refer to their battles.[9]\n\nThe Saga of the Jomsvikings relates that the Jomsvikings were highly selective in deciding whom to admit to their order. Membership was restricted to men of proven valor between 18 and 50 (with the exception of a boy named Vagn Åkesson, who defeated Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson in single combat at the age of 12). In order to gain admission, prospective members were required to prove themselves with a feat of strength, which often took the form of a ritual duel, or holmgang, with a Jomsviking.\n\nOnce admitted, the Jomsvikings required adherence to a strict code of conduct to instill a sense of military discipline among its members. Any violation of the rules could be punished with immediate expulsion from the order. Each Jomsviking was bound to defend his brothers and to avenge their deaths if necessary. He was forbidden to speak ill of his fellows or to quarrel with them. Blood feuds between members were to be mediated by Jomsviking officers. Jomsvikings were forbidden to show fear or to flee in the face of an enemy of equal or inferior strength, but orderly retreat in the face of vastly-outnumbering forces appears to have been acceptable. All spoils of battle were to be equally distributed among the entire brotherhood. No Jomsviking was permitted to be absent from Jomsborg for more than three days without the permission of the brotherhood. No women or children were allowed within the fortress walls, and none was to be taken captive. It is unclear, however, whether members were forbidden marriage or liaisons with women outside the walls.\n\nThere are different accounts for the origins of the order. Gesta Danorum (book 10) tells that a settlement named Julinum was conquered by the King of Denmark, Harald Bluetooth, who gave it to the Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong. Harald then provided Styrbjörn with a strong force with which Styrbjörn terrorized the seas. The Knýtlinga saga agrees by giving Harald as the founder of the Jomsvikings, but the story of Styrbjörn is not connected to the Jomsvikings. The Jómsvíkinga saga says that the settlement was founded by Palnatoke, receiving the location from the mythical Wendish ruler Burislav. Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa and Eyrbyggja saga agree with all previously mentioned versions by making Styrbjörn take command of the Jomsvikings after they already had been established.[10] Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa also tells that among the Norse there were many men from the \"East land\" arriving at Jomsborg, suggesting that it was a settlement of mixed ethnicity. Jomsviking chieftains included Palnatok, Styrbjörn the Strong, Sigvaldi Strut-Haraldsson, Thorkell the High, and Hemeng.[citation needed]\n\nAccounts of their size vary. In various sources, Jomsborg was supposed to have held anywhere from 30 to 300 ships in its harbor. However some historians believe Jomsborg was largely a market center with its Danish garrison imposed on the Wends.[11]\n\nGesta Danorum (book 10), Styrbjarnar þáttr Svíakappa and Eyrbyggja saga relate that in the early 980s, the exiled Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong brought the Jomsvikings to a devastating defeat against Styrbjörn's uncle King Eric the Victorious at the Battle of the Fýrisvellir, Uppsala, in 984 or 985, while trying to take the crown of Sweden by force of arms.[10] The fact that the Jomsvikings lost was attributed to a pact which the Swedish king Eric made with Odin. Three runestones from this time, the Högby Runestone (\"the brave champion Asmund fell on the Fyrisvellir\"), one of the Hällestad Runestones, labelled DR 295 (\"he did not flee at Uppsala\"), and the Sjörup Runestone (\"He did not flee at Uppsala, but slaughtered as long as he had a weapon\"), relate to deaths with honour at Uppsala, probably three Jomsvikings. The battle is also commemorated, in poetry, by the Icelandic skald Þórvaldr Hjaltason, who took part in the battle on the Swedish side.[citation needed] Jómsvíkinga saga tells that in 986, they attacked Haakon Jarl in Norway and were defeated in the Battle of Hjörungavágr. The saga recounts that Jomsvikings captured by the Norwegians and about to be executed exhibited courage and defiance, some being eventually spared by their captors. The Jómsvíkinga saga ends with a brief explanation of the battle's aftermath and, in fact, points to this battle as the beginning of the end for the Jomsvikings.[citation needed]\n\nAfter these two decisive defeats, the power of the Jomsvikings waned, but Olaf Trygvasson's Saga relates that they played a decisive, if treacherous, role in the Battle of Svolder in 1000. At Svolder, a Jomsviking force led by Sigvald Jarl abandoned King Olaf of Norway and joined forces with his enemies to annihilate his fleet.[citation needed] This action may have been intended to fight the Christianization of Scandinavia, which had been forcibly promoted by Olaf. As it happened though, the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard, who won the Norwegian throne when the sea battle ended, was (at least nominally) a Christian. He and his father, King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark, are reported to have been baptized in 965.[12] Their decline continued over the next few decades.\n\nAccording to the Heimskringla, King Magnus I of Norway decided to put an end to the Jomsviking threat. As part of consolidating his control of Denmark, he sacked Jomsborg in 1043, destroying the fortress and killing many of its inhabitants.[13]\n\nA golden disc bearing the name of Harald Bluetooth and Jomsvikings stronghold seat Jomsborg was re-discovered in Sweden in autumn 2014. The disc, also called the Curmsun Disc, is made of high gold content and has a weight of 25.23 grams. On the obverse there is a Latin inscription and on the reverse there is a Latin cross with four dots surrounded by an octagonal ridge. The inscription reads: \"+ARALD CVRMSVN+REX AD TANER+SCON+JVMN+CIV ALDIN+\" and translates as \"Harald Gormsson king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, diocese of Aldinburg\".[14] It is assumed that the disc was a part of a Viking hoard found in 1841 in the Polish village Wiejkowo near the town of Wolin by Heinrich Boldt.[15][16]\n• Jomsvikings are the focus of E. R. Eddison's novel Styrbiorn the Strong 17 and Horned Helmet 18 a juvenile historical novel by Henry Treece.\n• Fictionalized versions of the Jomsborg (under the name \"Jormsvik\") and the Jomsvikings appear in Guy Gavriel Kay's novel The Last Light of the Sun, which is set in a fictional world that closely parallels 9th-century Britain and Scandinavia. 19\n• In Tim Severin's Viking series, Thorgils spends time amongst the Jomsvikings, although they are a smaller, older, and weaker force.\n• The Long Ships by Frans G. Bengtsson retells an episode from the sagas, where a band of defeated Jomsvikings, about to be executed in Norway, are proud, undaunted and defiant to the end - winning their captors' grudging respect and some of them surviving against all odds.\n• The short story The King of Norway by Cecelia Holland, in the anthology Warriors, has at its center the story of the Battle of Hjörungavágr. 20\n• In the manga Vinland Saga by Makoto Yukimura, several of the main characters are based on Jomsvikings from the Sagas, such as Thorkell the High and Canute the Great. The manga depicts them as an elite force under Sven and then Canute during their invasion of England, while trying to keep their waning influence on the court. It is also said that the protagonist Thorfinn's father, Thors, was a Jomsviking until he became a pacifist, fleeing Jomsborg with his wife.\n• In the 2003 Polish film An Ancient Tale: When the Sun Was a God by Jerzy Hoffman, Jomsvikings are portrayed as marauders in the service of the main antagonist Popiel.\n• Swedish melodic death metal band Amon Amarth released the album Jomsviking in 2016.

But what do you guys think?Religión - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Religión suele definirse como un sistema cultural de determinados comportamientos, prácticas, cosmovisiones, éticas, morales, textos, lugares sagrados, profecías u organizaciones que relacionan la humanidad a elementos sobrenaturales, trascendentales, místicos o espirituales.[nota 1]​ Aunque no existe un consenso académico sobre qué constituye exactamente una religión,[1]​[2]​[3]​ Bernard Lonergan se aproxima a la religión como un conjunto de experiencias, significados, convicciones, creencias y expresiones de un grupo, a través de las cuales sus participantes responden a sus dialécticas de autotrascendencia y relación con la divinidad.[4]​\n\nMuchas religiones pueden haber organizado comportamientos, clero, una definición de lo que constituye la adhesión o pertenencia, lugares santos y escrituras.\n\nLa práctica de una religión puede incluir rituales, sermones, conmemoración o veneración (a una deidad, dioses o diosas), sacrificios, peregrinaciones, procesiones, festivales, festines, trance, iniciaciones, oficios funerarios, oficios matrimoniales, meditación, oración, música, arte, danza, servicio comunitario u otros aspectos de la cultura humana.[5]​\n\nMuchas religiones tienen narrativas, símbolos e historias sagradas que pretenden explicar el sentido de la vida o explicar el origen de la vida o el universo. A partir de estas creencias sobre el cosmos y la naturaleza humana, las personas pueden derivar una moral, ética o leyes religiosas o un estilo de vida.\n\nEn promedio, las mujeres de algunos países como Estados Unidos reportan ser «más religiosas» que los hombres.[6]​ No obstante, estudios al respecto no han observado esta tendencia fuera del ámbito de la religión cristiana.[7]​[8]​ Algunas personas siguen múltiples religiones o varios principios religiosos al mismo tiempo, independientemente de si la tradición de los principios religiosos que siguen permite el sincretismo o no.[9]​[10]​[11]​\n\nLa etimología del término «religión» ha sido debatida durante siglos debido a las dos interpretaciones que se han sostenido que además de ofrecer una propuesta acerca del origen de la palabra, subrayan alguna actitud religiosa.\n\nAntes de ser usada con un sentido relacionado con las divinidades, el término «religión» o «religioso» era utilizado para expresar un temor o un escrúpulo supersticioso. Así consta en textos de Julio César (De Bello Gallico VI 36) y Tito Livio (Historia de Roma desde su fundación IV 30).\n\nLa primera interpretación relacionada con el culto es la del orador latino Cicerón que en su obra De natura deorum ofrece la siguiente etimología: «Quienes se interesan en todas las cosas relacionadas con el culto, las retoman atentamente y como que las releen, son llamados «religiosos» a partir de la relectura».[12]​ Esta etimología —filológicamente más correcta— subraya la fidelidad a los deberes que la persona religiosa contrae con la divinidad y por tanto está más relacionada con la justicia.[13]​\n\nLa otra etimología propuesta por Lactancio hace derivar la palabra «religión» del verbo latino religare: «atados,ligados por un vínculo de piedad a Dios estamos “religados”, de donde el mismo término “religión” tiene su origen, no —como fue propuesto por Cicerón— a partir de “releyendo”».[14]​ Este segundo sentido resalta la relación de dependencia que «religa» al hombre con las potencias superiores de las cuales él se puede llegar a sentir dependiente y que le lleva a tributarles actos de culto.[15]​\n\nEn su ensayo Del imperio romano, José Ortega y Gasset escribe «Cuando el hombre cree en algo, cuando algo le es incuestionable realidad, se hace religioso de ello. Religio no viene, como suele decirse, de religare, de estar atado el hombre a Dios. Como tantas veces, es el adjetivo quien nos conserva la significación original del sustantivo, y religiosus quería decir ‘escrupuloso’; por tanto, el que no se comporta a la ligera, sino cuidadosamente. Lo contrario de religión es negligencia, descuido, desentenderse, abandonarse. Frente a relego está nec-lego; religente (religiosus)[16]​ se opone a negligente».[17]​\n\nDesde el establecimiento del concepto, definir qué es religión (del latín religare o re-legere) ha sido y es motivo de controversia entre especialistas y practicantes. Por ejemplo, según el sociólogo G. Lenski, es «un sistema compartido de creencias y prácticas asociadas, que se articulan en torno a la naturaleza de las fuerzas que configuran el destino de los seres humanos».[18]​ Por su parte, el antropólogo Clifford Geertz propone una definición alternativa: «La religión es un sistema de símbolos que obra para establecer vigorosos, penetrantes y duraderos estados anímicos y motivaciones en los hombres, formulando concepciones de un orden general de existencia y revistiendo estas concepciones con una aureola de efectividad tal que los estados anímicos y motivaciones parezcan de un realismo único».[19]​\n\nDebido al amplio uso del término, resulta especialmente complejo ofrecer una definición exhaustiva de la religión o del fenómeno religioso. Sin embargo, se puede afirmar que como hecho antropológico engloba, entre otros, los siguientes elementos: tradiciones, culturas ancestrales, instituciones, escrituras, historia, mitología, fe y credos, experiencias personales, interpersonales, místicas, ritos, liturgias, oraciones y otras. Para un estudio detallado es útil señalar que la religión es uno de los objetos de estudio centrales de la teología y en ello Bernard Lonergan señala ocho especializaciones funcionales constitutivas que generan un marco amplio de análisis: 1) la investigación de datos, 2) la interpretación, 3) la historia, 4) la dialéctica, 5) la explicitación de fundamentos, 6) el establecimiento de doctrinas, 7) la sistematización y 8) la comunicación.[20]​ Por ejemplo, el debate religioso ganará efectividad al centrarse en un tema puntual, como interpretar críticamente el mismo texto o comparar fundamentos interreligiosos, pero difícilmente avanzará al mezclar los ocho elementos sin método alguno.\n\nMás aún, las contradicciones son a veces solo aparentes. Uno de los elementos de debate puede rastrearse al observar que la palabra «religión» en ocasiones se usa como sinónimo de «religión organizada», «organización religiosa», o \"jerarquía religiosa\" es decir, grupos de personas que respaldan el ejercicio o la actividad de ciertas creencias y ceremonias, frecuentemente bajo la forma de entidades legales. Es decir, el debate puede explicarse del siguiente modo: mientras los teístas suelen argumentar sobre los méritos de la autotrascendencia humana o la naturaleza de la divinidad, los no-teístas critican los efectos nocivos de una jerarquía religiosa que favorece la decadencia de un colectivo. Bajo una óptica dialéctica, es razonable notar elementos de razón en ambos argumentos.\n\nPara elaborar sobre el origen del debate anterior, es útil seguir el análisis de especialización funcional, estratificación y jerarquía propuesto por Niklas Luhmann, donde las diversas actividades al interior de los colectivos ganan naturalmente detalle, prioridad y subordinación conforme los grupos se desarrollan.[21]​ Así, diversas experiencias, significados, convicciones y expresiones son atendidas primero los individuos más capaces, para después generar roles religiosos y eventualmente jerarquías entre individuos. Puede así entenderse que con tiempo las jerarquías religiosas suelen subordinar el interés colectivo al propio, auto afirmar su autoridad y establecer marcos normativos que les beneficien, consolidando la clausura operativa de un grupo, descrita también por Luhmann. Sin embargo ese mismo hecho, activa la imposibilidad futura del acoplamiento estructural del sistema religioso con su entorno, iniciando un proceso de decadencia.\n\nEs decir, el método de otras ciencias enriquece el debate religioso. Diversas ciencias humanas se han interesado por el fenómeno religioso desde sus respectivos puntos de vista como por ejemplo la antropología, la sociología, la psicología y la historia de las religiones. Por otro lado, disciplinas como la fenomenología de la religión estudian específicamente sus manifestaciones intentando dar con una definición exhaustiva del fenómeno y mostrar su relación con la índole propia del ser humano. En secciones subsecuentes se desarrollan más elementos para el análisis de la religión.\n\nFilosóficamente, la religión puede ser un estilo de vida, un camino hacia la plenitud, una plenitud que inicia desde el mismo instante que se cobra conciencia de la misma.\n\nEn un sentido más amplio, también se utiliza para referirse a una obligación de conciencia que impele al cumplimiento de un deber.[22]​\n\nLa definición del amplio espectro de significados que refleja el concepto religión, en cuanto implica encontrar un elemento propio, distintivo y único, es una exigencia propia de las culturas occidentales,[23]​ ya que son estas las que desde una postura más teísta distinguen entre divinidad y el resto del mundo. Especialmente, desde la Ilustración se han elaborado muchas y variadas definiciones intentando recoger los aspectos propios del fenómeno religioso. Aquí se mencionarán los más significativos. Es obvio que las definiciones que parten de un Ser Supremo o lo dan por supuesto se han de rechazar, pues no se aplican a muchas religiones de Asia oriental o a los pueblos primitivos.\n\nUna posibilidad es intentar una definición desde el punto de vista de las personas que practican la religión. Así encontramos propuestas como las de Friedrich Schleiermacher: «sentimiento de dependencia absoluta» que luego distingue este sentimiento de los tipos de dependencia relativa. William James subraya más bien «el carácter entusiasta de la adhesión» de los miembros de las religiones. Desde este punto de vista se pueden considerar elementos como los sentimientos, los factores experienciales, emotivos o intuitivos, pero siempre desde una perspectiva más bien individualista.\n\nCon el estudio que las ciencias humanas (sociología y antropología cultural especialmente) han realizado de la religión, se ha logrado formular otro conjunto de definiciones que consideran este fenómeno en su ámbito social y cultural. La conocida definición del sociólogo francés Durkheim entra en este grupo: «Una religión es un sistema solidario de creencias y de prácticas relativas a las cosas sagradas. […] Toda sociedad posee todo lo necesario para suscitar en sus miembros la sensación de lo divino, simplemente a través del poder que ella ejerce sobre ellos».[24]​\n\nSin embargo, con la llegada de la fenomenología de la religión se intentó ir más allá de las formas que buscaban el núcleo propio del fenómeno en la sociedad o en los aspectos individuales. Y en ese ámbito se identificó como propio de la religión el hecho de la presencia o consciencia de lo sagrado. Rudolf Otto en su obra, Lo santo, publicada en 1917, indica como esencia de la consciencia religiosa el temor reverencial ante aquello que, siendo desconocido (mysterium), al mismo tiempo sobrecoge (tremendum) y atrae casi irresistiblemente (fascinans).[25]​\n\nSin embargo, estos elementos que Otto refiere como propios de la experiencia religiosa parecen estar ausentes en las religiones asiáticas. En Mircea Eliade se da una ampliación de la noción de «sagrado» que perfecciona la definición de Otto. Habla de espacios, cosas y tiempos sagrados en la medida en que estos se relacionan con simbolismos y rituales propios de las religiones. Así la religión es la configuración u organización de la existencia a partir de dimensiones profundas de la experiencia humana que relacionan al hombre con algo que se le presenta como último y trascendente. Tales dimensiones varían de acuerdo con las circunstancias y culturas.\n\nA partir del siglo XVIII, con la irrupción del humanismo y el movimiento de los ilustrados en Europa, que se extenderá con rapidez a otras partes del mundo, se intenta separar la doctrina del Estado de la doctrina religiosa. Actualmente, estas ideas de separación de los poderes político y religioso todavía no ha concluido. En buena parte del planeta apenas ha empezado, y en los países occidentales, aunque observan la laicidad del Estado, todavía la religión puede actuar con una enorme influencia en sus legislaciones. Por ejemplo, en el caso de Estados Unidos,[26]​ Polonia o Italia.\n\nEn los países asiáticos, la separación entre Estado y religión está más o menos implícita de cierto laicismo. China, Japón, Vietnam y otros países del sudeste asiático conllevan cierto laicismo estatal en su propia historia al ser países en donde coexisten distintas religiones. En el caso de Tailandia o Sri Lanka, con mayorías budistas en más de un 90 %, se mantienen debates sociales para afrontar el laicismo del Estado y diversos cambios legales.[27]​\n\nEn los países con mayorías musulmanas hay distintas aproximaciones a la laicidad del Estado. Países como Turquía o Siria son más laicos, mientras que otros como Irán o Arabia Saudí se definen como islámicos. El mundo islámico es variado y complejo, y existen movimientos tanto secularizadores como prorreligiosos.[28]​\n\nIsrael es un Estado laico, si bien se proyecta como religioso. India es un caso parecido, también es un país laico, aunque su organización social y legislación están muy influidas por la religión. En estos casos están influidos, en buena medida, por el componente étnico de sus religiones mayoritarias.\n\nExisten diferentes clasificaciones de las religiones, según el criterio que se elija, por ejemplo:\n• Teísmo: es la creencia en una o más deidades. Dentro del teísmo cabe distinguir entre:\n• Monoteístas: aquellas religiones que afirman la existencia de un solo dios, que a menudo es el creador del universo. Las religiones monoteístas más numerosas son el cristianismo, islam y sijismo; seguidas por el judaísmo, bahaísmo noajísmo y el zoroastrismo 29 ​ 30 ​ 31 ​ 32 ​\n• Politeístas: creen en la existencia de diversos dioses organizados en una jerarquía o panteón, como ocurre en el hinduismo, el shinto japonés, o las antiguas religiones de la humanidad como la griega, la romana o la egipcia. Pueden ser incluidas creencias a veces calificadas como animistas como el vudú del oeste de África, que contempla espíritus existentes en los elementos de la naturaleza pero también diversas deidades. También cabe incluir aquí la mayoría de corrientes del neopaganismo moderno.\n• Henoteístas: el orientalista alemán Max Müller acuñó este término en el siglo para referirse a la creencia en un solo dios en la que se admiten otras deidades, como sucedía en la antigua religión egipcia especialmente con Akenatón. Aunque ya en la época de Muller resultó un término problemático, 33 ​ quedó con el tiempo incluido académicante dentro de politeísmo, panteísmo, etc., dependiendo del caso histórico. Actualmente, algunas sectas y cultos neopaganos han resucitado el término 34 ​\n• Dualistas: aquellas religiones que suponen la existencia de dos principios o divinidades opuestos y enfrentados entre sí, aunque solo uno de ellos suele ser merecedor de veneración por sus fieles, mientras que el otro es considerado demoníaco o destructivo. Cabe incluir en esta categoría el maniqueísmo y el catarismo.\n• No teístas: Hay religiones como el budismo y el taoísmo que no aceptan o no reconocen la existencia de dioses absolutos o creadores universales, o bien les otorgan funciones menores o muy específicas (como, por ejemplo, la creencia taoísta en el emperador de Jade). En ocasiones, estas deidades son vistas como recursos metafóricos utilizados para referirse a fenómenos naturales o a estados de la mente.\n• Panteísmo: es la creencia de que el universo, la naturaleza y Dios son equivalentes.\n• Panenteísmo: es la creencia de que Dios es a la vez inmanente y trascendente al universo o, en otras palabras, que Dios engloba el universo pero no se limita a él.\n\nOtra división que se utiliza consiste en hablar de religiones reveladas o no reveladas.\n• Las religiones reveladas se fundamentan en una verdad revelada de carácter sobrenatural desde una deidad o ámbito trascendente y que indica a menudo cuáles son los dogmas en los que se debe creer y las normas y ritos que se deben seguir.\n• Las religiones no reveladas no definen su origen según un mensaje dado por deidades o mensajeros de ellas, aunque pueden contener sistemas elaborados de organización de deidades reconociendo la existencia de estas deidades y espíritus en las manifestaciones de la naturaleza.\n\nOtra clasificación de las religiones es por origen o familia. Las religiones se agrupan en troncos de donde derivan, por ejemplo:\n\nUsualmente se acepta que las principales familias de religiones son las siguientes:\n\nAlgunas religiones de reciente creación tienen un estatus complejo, ya que no son reconocidas como religiones de manera universal. Según la antropología y la sociología, una secta o nuevo movimiento religioso es un grupo de personas con afinidades comunes: culturales, religiosas, políticas, esotéricas, etc. Habitualmente es un término peyorativo, frente al cual ha surgido el eufemismo «nuevos movimientos religiosos».\n\nAunque el vocablo «secta» esté relacionado con grupos que posean una misma afinidad, con el paso de los años ha adquirido una connotación relacionada con grupos de carácter religioso, a los que se califica como «secta destructiva». Estos grupos pueden tener un historial judicial en uno o varios países, por manipulación mental o por ser grupos de carácter destructivo. En algunos países, algunas de estas no están reconocidas o autorizadas. A menudo una secta está centrada en el culto personal al profeta o líder del grupo. La palabra secta se ha concebido derivada, principalmente, del latín sequi, ‘seguir’.\n\nLista de las principales religiones actualmente practicadas en el mundo, por orden alfabético.\n• Bahaísmo: fundado por Bahá'u'lláh (1817-1892), considerado por sus creyentes como el prometido de todas las religiones.

Sus enseñanzas se basan en el profeta y poeta Zoroastro del antiguo Imperio persa.\n• Deísmo: es una corriente de la filosofía que admite, mediante el raciocinio y la experiencia, la existencia de Dios como creador del mundo natural. La doctrina, sin embargo, no acepta otros elementos característicos de las religiones en su relación con la divinidad, como la existencia de revelaciones o la práctica de cultos. Puede decirse, por lo tanto, que los deístas creen en Dios pero no en las prácticas y los dogmas religiosos. El deísmo reconoce que Dios ha creado el universo aunque no cree en su intervención posterior para orquestar su destino.\n• Agnosticismo: la creencia de que la mayoría de las cosas son incognoscibles. En lo que respecta a la religión, generalmente se caracteriza por no creer ni no creer en una deidad.\n• Ateísmo: la creencia de que no existen deidades de ningún tipo.\n\nEl estudio de la religión suele implicar numerosos campos de investigación, entre ellos:\n• La religión comparada se ocupa del estudio comparativo de ideas, prácticas y demás elementos de las religiones.\n• La teología: trata de la cuestión de Dios y de sus relaciones con el mundo, y puede estudiarse separada de cualquier religión determinada o bien referida a una de ellas en particular.\n• La organología: en una religión en particular, trata de sus elementos, sus prácticas, su organización y su orden institucional.[cita requerida]\n• La apologética se interesa en la defensa de una religión particular, contra posibles ataques o críticas.\n• La psicología de la religión trata sobre los factores de la conducta humana, su mente y sus operaciones, tal como se manifiestan en la conducta religiosa. La psicología de la religión explica por qué un pueblo determinado prohija determinadas ideas religiosas, mediante el estudio de sus necesidades naturales, su ambiente y sus inclinaciones.\n• La neuroteología estudia la correlación entre los fenómenos neuronales con las experiencias subjetivas de carácter espiritual.\n• La filosofía de la religión la filosofía se ha ocupado de la religión en incontables ocasiones por su interés en el estudio de lo trascendente y su naturaleza así como su papel en la vida humana. En la segunda mitad del siglo pasado ha sido especialmente fructífera en cuanto a la religión por sus aportaciones en lógica y epistemología. Se ha explorado filosóficamente la experiencia religiosa, la fe y el discurso de las religiones 39 ​\n• La historia de la religión: trata de descubrir la base cultural de las ideas y prácticas de una religión concreta. Historiadores son también los estudiosos de los libros sagrados de las religiones, unos ejercen la llamada «alta crítica», estudiando los manuscritos para comprobar la validez de sus reivindicaciones; otros se ocupan de la llamada «crítica fundamental» o «crítica textual» dedicándose a la búsqueda y examen de textos auténticos. Podrían citarse muchos campos de especialización: estudios de las empresas misioneras, evolución de las instituciones religiosas (historia de la iglesia, inquisición...), manifestaciones de arte (música sacra, arquitectura religiosa, etc), religiones primitivas, sociología de la religión y orígenes sociales.\n• La religión apocalíptica: trata de estudiar los libros sagrados de las diferentes religiones, y encontrar su \"apocalipsis\" para estudiarlo, analizarlo, y encontrar los \"secretos de Dios\" para descubrirlos y encontrar el significado de los libros sagrados y su fin del mundo.\n\nA lo largo de la Historia, la práctica de la religión se ha organizado de diferentes maneras en sociedad. El hombre primitivo depositaba en el chamán (curandero) el conocimiento y explicaciones sobre asuntos religiosos. Esta figura todavía existe en pueblos indígenas de América, África y Oceanía.\n\nLas primeras civilizaciones agrícolas, con el desarrollo de las ciudades, verán surgir la figura del sacerdote, que se erige como mediador entre la sociedad y las divinidades. Esta figura cobrará una importancia enorme en Egipto, Grecia, Roma y América precolombina. A menudo con una doble función de médico y guía espiritual, supone una evolución del antiguo guía-chamán de la tribus primitivas.\n\nEl monacato surge en religiones como el cristianismo, el budismo o el taoísmo. El monacato allí donde está presente, personifica un esfuerzo más intenso en un camino religioso, y supondrá el esfuerzo por reunir o proteger a los eremitas dispersos. En religiones como la hebrea o el islamismo, son las personas con una notable capacidad de interpretación de las escrituras sagradas las que ostentan el papel de guía de una comunidad de seguidores. Así, la figura del imán o del rabino están presentes en estas religiones.\n\nEn el entorno hinduista, la casta de los brahmanes es la encargada de aclarar los asuntos religiosos.\n\nEn la Grecia Antigua, los filósofos ya intentaban explicar el origen de las creencias. Critias (filósofo y militar espartano, discípulo de Sócrates) pensaba que la religión (y el temor a los dioses) se determinó para imponer a cada uno el respeto a la sociedad: disciplina, moral, sentido del bien y del mal. Lucrecio en De rerum natura, emite la hipótesis de que los hombres inventaron a los dioses para explicar las maravillas y los misterios de la naturaleza: para explicar lo que no controlaban. Los antropólogos, psicólogos y sociólogos mantienen para la mayoría estas dos explicaciones.\n\nHasta el siglo XX, la perspectiva dominante sobre el origen de la experiencia religiosa la sitúa en el sentimiento de espanto o miedo ante lo desconocido o aquello que escapa a una explicación racional. Este punto de vista se hizo famoso por los trabajos de Rudolf Otto.[40]​ Más tarde, Mircea Eliade propone el término de hierofanía como percepción de lo sagrado, en donde el impulso o sentimiento religioso está caracterizado por un sentimiento de insuficiencia ante la explicación de la realidad que ofrecen los sentidos y la razón humanas.[41]​ La idea de hierofanía que propone Eliade asienta una oposición entre lo sagrado y lo profano que desplaza la anterior entre razón y miedo irracional. Este enfoque será el germen de un nuevo tratamiento en los estudios sobre la religión, y posibilitará su expansión en las principales universidades de Europa[42]​\n\nEn las religiones más antiguas, algunos miembros de sociedades de cazadores-recolectores o agrícolas se aislaban, en un estado de privación sensorial para favorecer la aparición de visiones y sueños místicos.[43]​ A menudo diversos métodos o productos alucinógenos eran empleados, como activadores de estos procesos. Estas prácticas todavía existen en las diversas formas del chamanismo. Del mismo modo, inciensos y plantas especiales como el opio y el cornezuelo del centeno, con propiedades alucinógenas, se desarrollaron en los oráculos de Grecia, Egipto y Roma. Esta utilización de sustancias externas podemos encontrarla en la historia en el origen de muchas de las grandes religiones; como por ejemplo ocurre con los primeros desarrollos visionarios de los pueblos indoeuropeos hace más de 10.000 años,[44]​ y que posteriormente se asentarían en el valle del Indo hace más de 4000 años.\n\nEn su evolución histórica, algunas religiones se irán sofisticando para observar nociones de pureza de cuerpo y espíritu que irán desterrando la alteración de la psique mediante sustancias externas. Las sustituirán los rituales, oraciones, y técnicas contemplativas que se convertirán en los facilitadores de la experiencia religiosa. Esta evolución, unida al triunfo o colapso de las diferentes civilizaciones que las acogen, y a la presión del medio social en el que se desenvuelven, explicarán en buena medida el futuro de las distintas religiones.\n\nLa actitud de los primeros sociólogos ante la religión fue diversa a la de los filósofos de la Ilustración pues no consideraban este fenómeno como un momento pasajero lleno de supersticiones en la historia de la humanidad, sino como un aspecto casi imprescindible de la organización social. Así, Feuerbach en su obra La esencia del cristianismo trata la religión cristiana desde el punto de vista sociológico y afirma que se trata de una alienación de capacidades propiamente humanas. Se ocupa además de algunos aspectos de la religión como el dogma, la liturgia y la simbología. Por su parte, Alexis de Tocqueville, en La democracia en América, realiza un análisis del catolicismo y del protestantismo dentro de las sociedades democráticas y desde un punto de vista sociológico. A partir de estos primeros pasos de la sociología, otros autores de gran renombre como Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Ferdinand Tönnies o Ernst Troeltsch dedicaron atentos estudios al fenómeno religioso dentro de la sociedad.\n\nEn el individuo, la religión existe como una tendencia que combina lo racional y lo irracional. A la hora de articularse, las religiones desarrollan doctrinas que intentan dar respuestas globales al individuo. Por este motivo, la mayoría de las grandes doctrinas religiosas han dado respuestas a preguntas relacionadas con la creación del universo, el propósito de la vida, la naturaleza humana, la definición de bien y mal, la moral, la escatología. Y del mismo modo elaboran diferentes códigos éticos, rituales y simbólicos. No obstante, toda religión intenta ofrecer una posición para vivir y entender la existencia del ser humano de una forma integral, incluyendo la dimensión espiritual, por lo que existen elementos comunes en todas ellas.\n\nEn las sociedades, a lo largo de la historia también han sido frecuentes las llamadas guerras de religión y las teocracias; es decir sociedades provistas de un gobierno cuya legitimidad descansa en un sistema de ideas religiosas. En ellas se atribuía un valor divino al soberano de la civilización, Mesopotamia, Egipto, Roma, Tíbet y el imperio Inca son significativos. En estos casos la ley es a la vez autoridad jurídica y religiosa. Un ejemplo contemporáneo que sobrevive es el Reino Unido, en donde la reina es «gobernadora suprema» de la Iglesia anglicana los territorios de Inglaterra y Gales, en donde aprueba el nombramiento de obispos dentro de dichos territorios.\n\nEn el siglo XX, Talcott Parsons deja constancia de la relación entre la religión y la sociedad, incluida la «cibernética»: genera valores, modifica las normas, influye en los roles sociales, y da una guía para los sistemas de la sociedad, de la personalidad y del comportamiento. Su sistema es considerado como una nueva aplicación de teorías evolucionistas a la religión. De ahí que uno de sus alumnos, Robert Bellah haya publicado Evolución religiosa.\n\nLa religión ha sido para algunas sociedades un símbolo de su identidad. Del mismo modo, la religión aparece como pieza fundamental en la ordenación moral de las sociedades y actuando de manera influyente en su orden legislativo. Esta relación puede ser vista como beneficiosa o perjudicial según como ha evolucionado esa acomodación.[45]​\n\nNormalmente la antropología cultural ha dirigido su atención al estudio de las manifestaciones religiosas en las sociedades que no conocen la escritura fijándose sobre todo en sus creencias y prácticas. Esta disciplina parte de distintos fundamentos al afrontar la religión. Por un lado, la teoría de los «hechos sociales» de Durkheim; por otro, los «tipos ideales» de Max Weber pero también las investigaciones sea de freudianos sea del marxismo acerca de las expresiones de la religiosidad. Los aspectos más representativos del estudio antropológico son los que tienen por objeto dilucidar las relaciones de la religión con los demás aspectos de la vida cultural: las leyes, la política, la economía, la ética. Sin embargo, no se ha logrado un consenso en relación con el método: el problema resulta complejo ya que un método explicativo implica un cierto grado de objetividad, y se contesta la posibilidad de que un estudioso no tenga preconceptos en relación con la religión, y un método interpretativo permite diversos acercamientos y respuestas. De cualquier forma, el primer paso consiste en agrupar y enumerar los varios usos y prácticas religiosas para luego buscar semejanzas o posibles orígenes comunes. En el año 1980, James Peacock y Thomas Kirsch publican un libro que intenta una vía intermedia para explicar desde la antropología el desarrollo de roles distintos en las religiones.[46]​\n\nDespués de esta publicación, los estudios se han ido centrando en tratar de determinar el origen de la religión. Así, ya desde 1965 Evans-Pritchard publican el libro Teorías acerca de la religión primitiva, que es una suerte de recolección de las interpretaciones y teorías que se han dado acerca del origen de la religión en las culturas humanas desde una perspectiva evolucionista. Las variantes propuestas son muchas: la magia, el totemismo, el politeísmo, el fetichismo, el animismo, etc.: sin embargo, Evans-Pritchard subraya la dificultad de demostrar que algunas de estas manifestaciones —que se presentarían como origen de la religión o la «primera» religión— sea aislable e independiente de otras manifestaciones cronológicamente contemporáneas. Las críticas y disputas se dieron especialmente ante los esquemas darwinistas que sugerían el paso del mito a la magia y de esta a la religión. Este tema del origen de la religión y el problema de las diferencias entre las religiones es el objetivo temático de la antropología cultural en el siglo XXI ya que ha abandonado su interés inicial por elaborar una especie de catálogo de todas las religiones y sus manifestaciones y prácticas.\n\nSegún Anthony F. C. Wallace y Olivier Herrenschmidt,[47]​ la religión es una actividad social que pone de manifiesto la existencia de creencias en seres o realidades sobrenaturales, esta actividad se declara mediante prácticas rituales que tienen como objetivo establecer relaciones entre los participantes y esas fuerzas sagradas. Las creencias tienen como objeto de su fe potencias o seres divinos y trascendentes, y las prácticas rituales que sustantivan esta relación son radicalmente diferentes de otros comportamientos sociales: son estrictamente formales (estilizadas, repetitivas y estereotipadas), y a diferencia de una representación, los participantes se lo toman con la plena seriedad de tener la creencia de estar haciendo algo performativo.[48]​\n\nBronislaw Malinowski[49]​ advierte que no hay que confundir la religión con la magia. Desde la cultura del hombre primitivo, religión y magia ya tenían funciones diferentes: la magia es práctica, técnica, de creencia sencilla, primordial, medio para un fin, en manos de especialistas con oscuras iniciaciones y con resultados inmediatos, mientras que la religión no muestra una utilidad directa ni se aprehende con conjuros, el mundo sobrenatural a que hace referencia es complejo e integra la vida futura en una cosmogonía teleológica, es un fin moral en sí, es un asunto de todos y se concelebra en comunidad y su función última apunta a establecer, fijar e intensificar actitudes que cohesionen a la sociedad.[50]​ Igualmente propone huir de ciertas trampas que una visión euro o cristianocéntrica puede provocar, renunciando a asignar a la religión ideas como: solo los hombres, y no los animales, tienen alma; existe una separación absoluta entre lo profano y lo sagrado, el monoteísmo es el modelo o meta, siendo el politeísmo residual, y también sugieren alejarse, finalmente, de una cierta fenomenología de la religión, que pretende que las religiones no son sino el fenómeno de una esencia incognoscible.[51]​\n\nDada la universalidad de su expresión, no se puede hablar de religión, sino de religiones, con una concreción histórica definida. Esta existencia históricamente definida permite hablar de diferentes roles de la religión: desde aquel que permitió al hombre primitivo adaptarse a la aterradora realidad reflexiva que le enfrentó a su propia muerte hasta el de ser herramienta de control social o de creación de comunidad social, o el de actuar como una herramienta de ecología, en tanto que adaptación cultural en un entorno rudo o cambiante, o un instrumento de cambio social, ya si es de progreso como si es de regresión.[52]​\n\nCada una de estas funciones viene enmarcada en un discurso religioso, un discurso que establece una relación entre el conocimiento incorporado al discurso y el poder de la posesión de dicho conocimiento. Este discurso mantiene una relación de dependencia con la organización social donde se desarrolla,[51]​ de tal manera que determinados tipos de sociedad tenderán a generar un tipo de religión, el discurso de la cual, en su sentido axiológico y pedagógico, querrá instaurar intencionadamente un determinado sentido de la existencia y de la realidad.[51]​\n\nFinalmente hay que tener en cuenta la existencia de dos formas de entender la relación religiosa con el objeto de culto: la mediata y la inmediata. La relación inmediata, menos atractiva para el antropólogo, está basada en la unión mística del creyente con la divinidad. La relación mediata, que es la base de la práctica colectiva y ordinaria, está basada en la existencia de un intermediario.\n\nSurge junto con el estudio de las religiones comparadas y con el psicoanálisis. Su método va desde la medida con instrumentos propios de las ciencias exactas -como por ejemplo los estudios de laboratorio propios del siglo XIX- hasta la introspección.\n\nUno de los pioneros de la psicología de la religión fue Wilhelm Wundt que consideraba cuatro etapas de la historia de la conciencia. El elemento unificador de ellas es el combate de la persona por afirmarse en el mundo físico. Se trata de las siguientes: el ritual primitivo, el totemismo, los mitos sobre los héroes y dioses y el humanismo. Por otro lado, Oswald Külpe introdujo otros métodos para estudiar la religión tales como las entrevistas y los cuestionarios de datos autobiográficos. Así las dos tendencias de la psicología del siglo XIX —el estudio introspectivo por un lado y el análisis objetivo por otro— se entrelazan también al aplicarse a la religión.\n\nEn Estados Unidos la psicología nació como disciplina independiente. Stanley Hall creó un equipo de investigación que introdujo métodos empíricos para el estudio de la religión. En 1881 dio cursos sobre la relación entre la pubertad y la conversión religiosa y en el año 1904 fundó una revista llamada The American Journal of Religious Psychology and Education. Algunos de sus alumnos como James Leuba se dedicaron de por vida al estudio de la psicología de la religión.\n\nEn 1899, otro de sus alumnos, E. D. Starbuck publicó el primer tratado de psicología de la religión -The Psychology of Religion- que trataba las coincidencias en la descripción de la pubertad, de la dementia precox y la conversión religiosa. Fue una obra controvertida.\n\nEn el año 1902, William James publicó The varieties of religious experience donde centra su estudio en la unicidad de las experiencias morales y religiosas a partir de métodos de análisis introspectivo. En ese mismo período, Pierre Janet y Sigmund Freud iniciaron sus estudios a partir del subconsciente.\n\nFreud consideraba todos los ritos y creencias religiosas como proyecciones inconscientes de los conflictos internos a la familia que afirman la posición del yo en la sociedad: así en el ámbito propio de las creencias religiosas y partiendo de ellas, tales conflictos podrían resolverse. La religión habría nacido del sentimiento de culpa por el asesinato de la figura del padre, culpabilidad que sería liberada a través del sacrificio religioso. Incluso cuando reconocía ventajas en la religión, buscó promover un mayor realismo y resignación dado que la religión contendría muchas fijaciones infantiles.[53]​\n\nUno de los alumnos de Freud, Carl Gustav Jung se ocupó también del tema religioso. Consideraba la religión como una manifestación de un nivel más profundo de la conciencia o al menos más profundo que el ámbito sexual sostenido por su maestro. A partir de sus estudios sobre la Alquimia, llegó a la conclusión que la religión podía ser también una forma de unir consciente con inconsciente en un «yo individuado» y confirmar así su teoría de los arquetipos.\n\nSiguiendo esos pasos, otro discípulo de Freud, Eric Erikson, desarrolló más la teoría evolutiva de la conciencia que partiría de la creencia religiosa para unificarse.\n\nIncluso cuando las aproximaciones que dependen de Freud y de Jung sean las más influyentes también se dieron en Europa algunas otras interpretaciones, como por ejemplo la que intentó fundar una psicología de la religión a partir de los instrumentos de la teoría del conocimiento de Kant (véanse por ejemplo, los trabajos de Richard Müller-Freienfels.\n\nLos modernos desarrollos afirman a la psicología de la religión como un ámbito demasiado reciente de estudio, en donde buena parte de lo que se considera experiencia religiosa no puede ser admitido bajo criterios empíricos a la vez que se contrastan efectos beneficiosos y duraderos para el individuo, por lo que es una disciplina de creciente interés y actividad.[54]​\n\nEn las principales religiones encontramos lo que se suelen llamar experiencias místicas o trascendentes como una base fundacional de la experiencia religiosa. La mística se refiere a conseguir de manera experiencial la identidad, comunión o consciencia plena de la última realidad que presentan las religiones; ya sea una verdad, un estado de consciencia, o una o varias deidades. Las experiencias místicas no se atienen al razonamiento lógico y la comprensión intelectual. A un seguidor religioso que esté desarrollando esta faceta de su religión se le llama místico. En la mística por tanto prima la introspección respecto a la extraversión, y en ella se establece una relación de carácter más directo y personal entre el individuo y su religión. Históricamente en algunas religiones determinadas, la mística es la primera fuente de autoridad en las diversas interpretaciones. En las principales religiones se suelen distinguir escuelas, tradiciones o movimientos místicos.\n\nAunque en principio la mayoría de religiones son doctrinalmente facilitadoras de estas experiencias místicas, también a menudo las organizaciones religiosas no las han tolerado, considerándolas un contrapoder a la hora de interpretar los significados religiosos en sociedad. En el cristianismo, la Inquisición católica o algunas reformas protestantes persiguieron diferentes variantes del misticismo clasificándolas como herejías. En el islamismo, el sufismo ha experimentado dificultades tras la gran Reforma. El clero del budismo tibetano o japonés arrinconó doctrinalmente algunos enfoques contemplativos que no eran de su agrado debido a sus consecuencias sociales.\n\nEntre los intelectuales occidentales, el misticismo ha tenido defensores y detractores dentro y fuera de las religiones. A partir del siglo XIX, la observación de la religión proveniente del materialismo histórico la considerará de manera crítica. Émile Durkheim la atribuye a una 'efervescencia colectiva' en el contexto social en el que tales experiencias se producen.\n\nWilliam James encabezará una interpretación psicológica que enmarcará a la experiencia mística de las religiones como parte de algo mucho más amplio y no exclusivo de ellas. A partir del siglo XX, con autores como Mircea Eliade se abre una nueva etapa más sosegada y científica para el estudio de las religiones y para la consideración de la mística. Actualmente, interpretaciones como las de Csikszentmihalyi hablan de teorías de un «estado de flujo» que puede aparecer en la mente humana realizando diversas actividades que exijan concentración, provocando determinado estado de felicidad. La exploración científica más moderna de los ámbitos de contemplación, éxtasis y meditación común a la mística de las distintas religiones arrojan conclusiones tan espectaculares como abiertas a la especulación, siendo este un terreno tan interesante como inexplorado para la ciencia.[55]​\n\nEn muchos casos, en las religiones de Asia oriental, la mística y la especulación filosófica no han sufrido tantas dificultades históricas, estando integradas en la práctica religiosa de sus seguidores. En la actualidad los teólogos del cristianismo están divididos, unos apuestan por dar más énfasis a la mística,[56]​ mientras otros abogan por separar la mística de la ciencia, diferenciando la experiencia de la fe de los hechos históricos.[57]​ En el islamismo, el sufismo gana adeptos con rapidez tanto en Europa como en los países islámicos.[58]​\n\nEl conocimiento religioso, según los seguidores de las religiones, puede ser obtenido de líderes religiosos, textos sagrados y/o la propia revelación personal. Algunos puntos de vista de las religiones observan este conocimiento como ilimitado en alcance y capaz de resolver cualquier pregunta, otras le otorgan un rol más restringido o acompañando al conocimiento obtenido mediante la observación de los fenómenos físicos. Algunas religiones otorgan al conocimiento religioso la característica de ser infalible.\n\nMuchos textos religiosos cuentan con muchos siglos de antigüedad: el Poema de Gilgamesh, el Libro de los Muertos, el Rig-veda, la Biblia, el Majábharata (con el Bhagavad-guita), el Ramaiana, los Puranás, el Corán. Estos textos no solo han sido de interés dentro de las propias religiones sino también especialmente para la filosofía en la disciplina de la Filosofía de la religión. Esta estudia[39]​ las diferentes concepciones teístas o no teístas, la cosmología de las religiones así como sus argumentos de diseño, el misticismo, el problema del mal, la epistemología y así un amplio espectro de asuntos que son tratados desde el aparato intelectual filosófico.\n\nEn el ámbito hispano existen escritores, filósofos y teólogos de renombre que se han ocupado de la filosofía de la religión. Entre ellos Ciro Alegría, Leonardo Boff, Jorge Luis Borges, Lluis Busquets i Grabulosa, Pedro Laín Entralgo, Benjamín Forcano, David Flusser, José Ortega y Gasset, Octavio Paz, Xabier Picaza, Margarita Pinto, Miguel de Unamuno, Miguel Sarmiento.\n\nEn las religiones existen a menudo grandes desarrollos filosóficos cuya misión es aclarar o conciliar la doctrina religiosa con la razón humana. En las religiones teístas se conoce a este desarrollo como Teología. En Asia oriental, muchas veces, aunque los desarrollos filosóficos son grandes y variados, no existen como disciplina diferenciada dentro de la propia religión, filosofía y religión está entrelazada. En otras religiones no existe un aparato filosófico, en especial en las religiones tribales y chamánicas. Los desarrollos filosóficos de las religiones recogen los distintos aspectos de la doctrina religiosa o la verdad o deidad que las sustenta, y que son históricamente la explicación a las distintos puntos de vista dentro de cada religión.\n• Panteísmo es un punto de vista filosófico en donde toda la realidad tiene una naturaleza divina, por lo que se rechaza la idea de una entidad sagrada o Dios que sea personal. Filósofos como Spinoza se adhirieron al panteísmo, identificando la Naturaleza como Dios. Religiones orientales como el sintoísmo japonés o el taoísmo chino tienen una enorme carga panteísta.\n• Monismo es un punto de vista filosófico que subraya la unidad de todo lo que existe, afirmando unas leyes subyacentes que niegan las divisiones en ella. El monismo por tanto se distancia de observar un dualismo o pluralismo. Los orígenes del monismo remiten a los filósofos griegos como Tales de Mileto, Pitágoras, Parménides o Empédocles. El monismo fue una visión frecuente en filósofos neoplatónicos como Plotino, el filósofo más influyente en los primeros Padres de la Cristiandad[cita requerida]. El islamismo recoge una fuerte influencia también desde los griegos, y en el hinduismo es otro ingrediente importante en su enorme diversidad filosófica.\n• Gnosticismo afirma una dualidad inherente en la manifestación de lo sagrado. Materia y espíritu, bien y mal así como otros conceptos, aparecen como opuestos que deben ser resueltos en el individuo dando primacía a una vía de conocimiento a menudo bastante experiencial. El gnosticismo ha tenido una fuerte influencia en los primeros desarrollos del cristianismo, y desde la perspectiva filosófica occidental es un enfoque presente en los desarrollos de las religiones orientales.\n• Fundamentalismo afirma el carácter literal de las escrituras o relatos sagrados, negando por tanto sus significados más simbólicos o psicológicos. También es conocida como literalismo. Está muy circunscrito a las religiones teístas y actualmente es popular en varios movimientos protestantes de Estados Unidos. La visión fundamentalista del teísmo supone en muchas ocasiones una negación radical de las verdades científicas. Una de las derivaciones del enfoque fundamentalista es el Creacionismo, que niega la evolución de las especies y las teorías científicas sobre el origen del universo, al afirmar que el relato bíblico de la creación del mundo es literalmente auténtico.\n• No teísmo afirma la inexistencia de deidades o bien las admite pero les niega un papel directamente activo en la liberación del individuo. El no teísmo, también denominado ateísmo, existe en el budismo y el taoísmo. En algunas variantes del budismo existe el culto a deidades si bien tienen un papel psicológico, ritual o simbólico, pero en todo caso siempre provisional. El taoísmo observa dos variantes unidas pero bien diferenciadas: la filosófica y la más contemplativa o de meditación. En este último, las deidades de la religión tradicional china han sido absorbidas como elementos simbólicos para prácticas de carácter psicofísico.\n• Determinismo es una doctrina filosófica que afirma que todo acontecimiento, incluyendo el pensamiento humano y las acciones, están predeterminadas por una cadena de causa y consecuencia. En las religiones esta postura filosófica se enmarca dentro de la doctrina de la Predestinación. Este punto de vista asume que una deidad que sea omnipotente o una ley absoluta no puede dejar nada al azar. La doctrina de la predestinación fue importante en el protestantismo cristiano, especialmente en el movimiento Calvinista. En las religiones orientales como el hinduismo o el budismo, existe la doctrina del karma que asume una ley universal de causa y efecto. Pero el karma depende de la intencionalidad de los seres conscientes; las consecuencias son causadas por decisiones de estos, lo cual no implica una predeterminación o destino. Por medio de la creencia en la reencarnación, la creencia en la predestinación es muy alta en el hinduismo. En el budismo está también difundida a nivel popular, si bien doctrinalmente supone una distorsión del pensamiento de Buda. 59 ​\n• Sincretismo supone la conciliación de puntos de vista distintos e incluso opuestos. En las religiones el sincretismo implica adoptar elementos de dos o más religiones. El sincretismo ritual y devocional es una constante en la evolución de las religiones a través de su historia cuando han contactado unas con otras, si bien esos elementos se van asimilando en el tiempo dentro de una sola religión. Actualmente se consideran religiones sincréticas varios cultos caribeños y americanos que mezclan catolicismo y prácticas e ideas de las religiones tribales. En oriente se realiza un sincretismo devocional a nivel popular, uniendo al taoísmo o al budismo con las prácticas ancestrales de culto a los antepasados. En Occidente el sincretismo está más presente por la creación de nuevas sectas que suelen diseñarse mezclando ideas y elementos de las grandes religiones.\n\nLa mayoría de religiones suelen tener una parte de conocimiento exotérico y otra esotérico.\n• El lado exotérico de la religión se refiere a un conocimiento que es público, inteligible y accesible.\n• El lado esotérico se refiere a aquella parte que es secreta o discreta, críptica, o a la que se accede por mecanismos jerárquicos de confianza entre sus miembros.\n\nEn casi todas las grandes religiones ambas facetas existen. Las religiones teístas suelen aludir al acceso al conocimiento esotérico como un don o bendición de la deidad hacia la persona. En el cristianismo por ejemplo, el concepto de Gracia se considera un don de Dios que entre otras cosas permite a la persona penetrar en significados más profundos. Similares ideas existen en la religión musulmana y judía.\n\nEn otras religiones, el conocimiento esotérico suele afirmarse como un mecanismo de transmisión oral, en ocasiones al margen de las escrituras sagradas o de aquellas que son públicas. El budismo tiene algunas variantes, especialmente aquellas provenientes del budismo tibetano, que son fuertemente esotéricas. El taoísmo tiene en su faceta contemplativa algunos complicados métodos psicofísicos con un fuerte componente esotérico y de iniciación.\n\nNormalmente, en las propias religiones coexisten puntos de vista distintos que tienden a rechazar o afianzar el lado esotérico.\n\nEn ocasiones es importante distinguir entre «religión» y «postura religiosa». Siendo la religión un sistema de creencias, preceptos, prácticas y rituales, una postura religiosa se refiere a la forma como un individuo se identifica frente a una o varias religiones. Por otro lado, existe la postura de quienes niegan el valor o la utilidad de las religiones, las niegan o las adecúan a sus propios planteamientos personales o de grupo. También se observan diferentes posturas religiosas en los enfoques de aplicación a la sociedad en temas como el laicismo o el diálogo interreligioso.\n• Religiosas: afirma la pertenencia a alguna religión o credo.\n• Practicantes: asumen algún mensaje o contenido religioso e intentan ponerlo en práctica siguiendo prácticas, ritos o celebraciones.\n• No practicantes: asumen algún mensaje o contenido religioso pero no participan de prácticas, ritos o celebraciones.\n• No religiosas: niegan explícitamente la pertenencia a alguna religión o credo, o están en desacuerdo con los contenidos de las religiones.\n• Ateos: (del griego a=sin teo=dios) sin dios. Ateo es quien vive ajeno a la consideración de alguna deidad que influya en la realidad. El término ateísmo se puede referir a dos actitudes distintas: la indiferencia por la existencia de divinidades o la no creencia en la posibilidad de su existencia.\n• apateístas: un ateísmo en el que se mantienen una postura de considerar que la posible existencia de deidades y la búsqueda de conocimiento al respecto no es importante, y que en consecuencia el debate al respecto debe ser ignorado. Según Étienne Borne, el apateísmo supone un ateísmo llevado a la práctica.\n• Agnósticos: postura que niega la posibilidad de conocer alguna verdad religiosa. El agnóstico afirma que no hay certeza para asegurar cuál de las diferentes verdades incompatibles que presentan las religiones es la verdadera. Ello no implica que carezcan necesariamente de interés por lo espiritual, sino que no realizan afirmaciones ni sostienen creencias específicas sobre la realidad en términos religiosos. Quienes mantienen la postura agnóstica pueden no ser necesariamente antirreligiosos y pueden ser respetuosos con todas las creencias.\n• Ignósticos: El ignosticismo o igteísmo es la posición respecto a la creencia de Dios, en que primero se cuestiona la definición de Dios. El ignóstico o igteísta se pregunta: ¿qué se entiende por Dios? Recién una vez que se conozca la respuesta se podrá comprobar si Dios existe o no existe.\n• Fundamentalismo: el fundamentalismo se basa en la aplicación de un dogma o creencia de manera literal, sea religioso o de otro tipo, negando así el valor de otras explicaciones o la potencial ampliación de significados para cualquier certeza. El fundamentalismo elimina la posibilidad de coexistencia de interpretaciones diferentes de la realidad y la existencia, necesitando a menudo de su desaparición o eliminación para satisfacer un criterio único de verdad.\n• Fundamentalismo religioso: asume las explicaciones literales de los textos religiosos negando sus significados simbólicos, temporales o psicológicos. De manera general esto deriva en la negación y el deseo de eliminar otras explicaciones, ya vengan de otras posturas religiosas, de la ciencia o de la sociedad.\n• Fundamentalismo antirreligioso: asume las explicaciones literales de los textos no religiosos, negando sus significados temporales o ignorando la provisionalidad de las verdades científicas y sociales. De manera general deriva en la negación y el deseo de eliminar otras explicaciones, vengan desde posturas religiosas o desde visiones diferente de la propia ciencia que sean contrarias a la propia.\n• Laicismo: la palabra viene del griego laikus (pueblo) en oposición a klerikus (clérigo). La palabra laico define por tanto a aquellos que no son clérigos, ya sea dentro de la organización religiosa como en toda la sociedad civil. El laicismo afirma la necesidad de una ordenación de la sociedad sin la participación directa de los clérigos y por lo tanto independiente de la influencia religiosa. La defensa del laicismo implica que deben ser los laicos quienes diseñen, ordenen y apliquen las leyes, usos y costumbres de una sociedad, dejando a los clérigos esa función solo para el ámbito de sus organizaciones religiosas. La libre práctica del laicismo está presente en la Antigua Grecia, cuya idiosincrasia fue la tolerancia religiosa. El laicismo supone una visión de la sociedad cuya defensa ha existido históricamente tanto dentro como fuera de las religiones. Del mismo modo, los ataques a esta postura han existido también desde dentro y fuera de las religiones. En el laicismo cohabitan diferentes visiones, desde aquellas que se muestran respetuosas con la existencia del hecho religioso hasta aquellas más fundamentalistas que lo reinterpretan como un vehículo para la erradicación de las religiones. Del mismo modo, en las religiones coexisten diferentes posturas que asumen al laicismo como algo beneficioso o no perjudicial, hasta aquellas que lo reinterpretan como un mal inevitable pero que puede ser reformulado para mantener grados de injerencia religiosa en el poder civil.\n• Diálogo interreligioso: aunque históricamente las religiones del mundo han tenido contacto entre sí y conocimiento unas de otras, no será hasta el siglo cuando la humanidad establezca la necesidad pública de un canal de comunicación constante y activo en lo que se ha llamado diálogo interreligioso. Las principales religiones y sus líderes han efectuado en las últimas décadas llamamientos para aumentar este diálogo como vía para erradicar los fundamentalismos y contribuir a la paz en el mundo. Los encuentros de este tipo más famosos han sido los de Asís (Italia) teniendo como anfitriona a la iglesia católica y agrupando a las principales religiones del mundo, los de Getsemaní (Israel) realizados para un diálogo entre religiones occidentales y orientales, y recientemente el convocado por el islamismo de la mano del rey de Arabia Saudí, Abdullah Bin Abdelaziz, que por primera vez abre de manera explícita al islamismo a este tipo de encuentros.\n\nAndrés Salazar, profesor e investigador del Instituto de La Familia, es el coordinador del capítulo Colombia en la investigación internacional “Mapa Mundial de la Familia” (en inglés World Family Map). En el capítulo 2019, investigaron la relación de la fecundidad con la religión.[60]​\n\nEn los cinco países latinos en los que se hizo la encuesta, se encontró que los grupos de personas religiosas tienen más hijos que aquellos que ni practican ni están afiliados a una religión. La diferencia es cercana al 0.4; es decir, cuatro hijos más por cada diez personas. La principal conclusión es que las personas que están teniendo más hijos, son personas que están afiliadas a una religión.\n\nSe encontró que entre los grupos que tienen más hijos están las personas afiliadas al Islam, seguidos por los ortodoxos, mormones, otros cristianos e hindúes. En cuanto a los católicos y protestantes, se halló que el promedio en las tasas de fecundidad es un poco más bajo. Luego, se encuentran los que no están afiliados a una religión: hay dos grupos, los que se consideran espirituales, pero no de alguna religión (estos tienen más hijos) y los que dicen no serlo (es menor el promedio). Ambos grupos tienen menos hijos que los afiliados.\n\nHay autores que dicen que la religión puede influir en las actitudes y prácticas del matrimonio y, por lo tanto, en la fecundidad. Sin embargo, en Latinoamérica hay una baja nupcialidad, las tasas de matrimonio están entre el 20 % y 30 %, mientras que, en otros países, están en 60 % y 80 %. Esto podría explicar, en parte, la baja fecundidad en Latinoamérica (World Family Map, 2015).\n\nSegún Ferran Esteve, se puede observar en las conclusiones del estudio internacional en 19 países ‘¿Qué tienen que ver el matrimonio y la fecundidad con la economía’, elaborado por el Social Trends Institute (STI), que las familias coherentes con su religiosidad tienen más hijos que las no practicantes.[61]​\n\nEl estudio recuerda que el descenso de la fecundidad que se inició hace tiempo en Escandinavia, propagándose posteriormente al resto de Europa, “está fuertemente asociado a la difusión de valores seculares, el declive de la autoridad religiosa y el auge del individualismo”.\n\nEsa revolución de los valores culturales tradicionales que se popularizó en la década de los sesenta llevó a un “cambio de actitud hacia el divorcio, la anticoncepción, el sexo, el tener hijos siendo solteros y la religión”.\n\nEsas actitudes se difundieron rápidamente hacia el sur, “a través de España, Portugal, Italia y Grecia en los últimos años de la década de los setenta y a lo largo de los ochenta”, mientras las tasas de nupcialidad y de fecundidad iban cayendo, añade el estudio.\n\nComo contraste, actualmente sigue dándose una “fuerte y creciente correlación entre los valores religiosos y las familias más numerosas que la media”, destaca el informe.\n\nUn análisis de 53 países de todas las regiones del mundo, desde África a Oceanía, pasando por las Américas y desde la Europa central a la oriental, indica que los hombres y las mujeres que asisten a los oficios religiosos al menos una vez al mes o más tienen 0,5 más hijos de media que los que asisten con menos frecuencia o no lo hacen nunca.\n\nEn Francia, por ejemplo, las mujeres blancas practicantes aventajan en fecundidad media a las mujeres blancas no religiosas y, como el científico político Eric Kaufman señala, esta disparidad ha crecido a lo largo de los años, indica el estudio.\n\nEn España, las mujeres católicas practicantes tienen un número significativamente mayor de hijos que las católicas no practicantes, teniendo en cuenta los ingresos, el estado civil, la educación y otras constantes.\n\nEste contraste se puede observar en el resto del mundo: las personas religiosas suelen tener un número de hijos considerablemente mayor que el resto de la población, concluyen los responsables del informe.\n\nCatólico/a 41.2%, Evangélico/a 5.5%, Testigo/a de Jehová 1.1%, Mormón/a 0.4%, Adventista 0.3%, Judío/a 0.1%, Otro 1.4%, Ninguna 31.3%, Ateo/a 1.6%, Agnóstico/a 0.6%, No

Two of them, Microsoft Public License and Microsoft Reciprocal License, have been approved by the Open Source Initiative as open source licenses[3][4] and are regarded by the Free Software Foundation as free software licenses.[5] Other shared source licenses are proprietary, and thus allow the copyright holder to retain tighter control over the use of their product.\n\nMicrosoft's Shared Source Initiative has been imitated by other companies such as RISC OS Open Ltd.[6]\n\nMicrosoft also uses specific licenses for some of their products, such as the Shared Source CLI License[7] and the Microsoft Windows Embedded CE 6.0 Shared Source License.[8]\n\nThe following licenses are considered open-source by the Open Source Initiative and free by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nThis is the least restrictive of the Microsoft licenses and allows for distribution of compiled code for either commercial or non-commercial purposes under any license that complies with the Ms-PL. Redistribution of the source code itself is permitted only under the Ms-PL.[9] Initially titled Microsoft Permissive License, it was renamed to Microsoft Public License while being reviewed for approval by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).[10] The license was approved on October 12, 2007, along with the Ms-RL.[11] According to the Free Software Foundation, it is a free software license but not compatible with the GNU GPL.[5] Ms-PL provides a free and flexible licensing for developers using source codes under this license. However, the Ms-PL is a copyleft license because it requires the source code of software it governs to be distributed only under the same license (the Ms-PL).[12]\n\nThis Microsoft license allows for distribution of derived code so long as the modified source files are included and retain the Ms-RL.[13] The Ms-RL allows those files in the distribution that do not contain code originally licensed under Ms-RL to be licensed according to the copyright holder's choosing. This is similar, but not the same as the CDDL, EPL or LGPL (GPL with a typical \"linking exception\").[citation needed] Initially known as the Microsoft Community License, it was renamed during the OSI approval process.\n\nOn December 9, 2005, the Ms-RL license was submitted to the Open Source Initiative for approval by John Cowan.[14] OSI then contacted Microsoft and asked if they wanted OSI to proceed. Microsoft replied that they did not wish to be reactive and that they needed time to review such a decision.[15]\n\nAt the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in July 2007, Bill Hilf, director of Microsoft's work with open source projects, announced that Microsoft had formally submitted Ms-PL and Ms-RL to OSI for approval.[16] It was approved on October 12, 2007, along with the Ms-PL.[11] According to the Free Software Foundation, it is a free software license but not compatible with the GNU GPL.[5]\n\nThe following source-available software licenses have limitations that prevent them from being open-source according to the Open Source Initiative and free to the Free Software Foundation.\n\nThis is a version of the Microsoft Public License in which rights are only granted to developers of Microsoft Windows-based software.[17] This license is not open source, as defined by the OSI, because the restriction limiting use of the software to Windows violates the stipulation that open-source licenses must be technology-neutral.[18] It is also considered to be non-free by the Free Software Foundation due to this restriction.[5]\n\nThis is a version of the Microsoft Reciprocal License in which rights are only granted when developing software for a Microsoft Windows platform.[19] Like the Ms-LPL, this license is not open source because it is not technology-neutral[18] due to its restriction that licensed software must be used on Windows, and is also not considered free by the Free Software Foundation due to this restriction.[5]\n\nThis is the most restrictive of the Microsoft Shared Source licenses. The source code is made available to view for reference purposes only, mainly to be able to view Microsoft classes source code while debugging.[20] Developers may not distribute or modify the code for commercial or non-commercial purposes.[21] The license has previously been abbreviated Ms-RL, but Ms-RL now refers to the Microsoft Reciprocal License.[13]\n\nTwo specific shared source licenses are interpreted as free software and open source licenses by FSF and OSI. However, former OSI president Michael Tiemann considers the phrase \"Shared Source\" itself to be a marketing term created by Microsoft. He argues that it is \"an insurgent term that distracts and dilutes the Open Source message by using similar-sounding terms and offering similar-sounding promises\".[22]\n\nThe Shared Source Initiative has also been noted to increase the problem of license proliferation.[23]The: The Shared Course Initiative connects language classrooms at Columbia, Cornell, and Yale via high-definition videoconferencing.\n\nCheck out the Spring 2025 course offerings, which include 21 Less Commonly Taught Languages and 50 individual language classes.Microsoft, Proprietary Code and the Shared Source Initiative: In a move to build better relationships with certain classes of customer, Microsoft in 2001 began allowing them to look at portions of Windows source code. Several programs were set up, serving selected enterprises, “most valuable professionals,” OEMs, system integrators, academics and several other customer categories all grouped under one heading: the Shared Source Initiative.\n\nA later addition to the scheme, launched in January 2003, was the Government Security Program (GSP). Under its auspices, government agencies from qualifying countries can view source code for current versions, beta releases and service packs of Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows CE.\n\nIn addition, says Microsoft — subject to such requirements as U.S. export approval — qualified GSP participants also can obtain access to cryptographic code and development tools. There is one caveat, however: Participating bodies can’t modify the code except in limited circumstances in close collaboration with Microsoft.\n\n“The GSP was crafted specifically to address the burgeoning security concerns and vulnerabilities of national governments and their key agencies,” according to Jason Matusow, manager of the Shared Source Initiative program. “As a highly focused program targeting security issues, the GSP promotes centralized coordination behind a sponsoring national agency that focuses on security as its core mission or priority (typically, the national interior ministry, IT ministry or a dedicated security department). This agency ordinarily conducts the overall security review on behalf of the central government, and then may bring other agencies into the source-access program as warranted to undertake specific security-related projects.”\n\nJupiter Research’s Microsoft specialist, Joe Wilcox, doesn’t disagree — but like other industry observers, he believes this is only half the story. “Keep in mind,” he told TechNewsWorld, “that Microsoft is a U.S. company, and there can be concerns that a U.S. company might have some ‘support’ from the government — some back doors into the software, that kind of thing. Those suspicions don’t have to be true to be a problem for Microsoft. By allowing some access to the code, it can alleviate those fears and fears around security in general.”\n\nWilcox, who said he views the program as a response to the “open-source threat,” pointed out that several countries have incentives to consider alternatives to Microsoft software and even to any U.S.-produced commercial software. “Countries like China, India and Russia,” he noted, “have good reasons to try and develop their own indigenous software industries. And one way to do that is to build around open-source projects like Linux. With this program, Microsoft is trying to present them with an alternative.”\n\nDoes the Shared Source Initiative — and the GSP in particular — represent a shift in Microsoft’s thinking about “openness” in software? Certainly, the section of its Web site dealing with the general topic of open-source software sounds surprisingly positive.\n\n“Microsoft believes the results of government-funded basic research should be widely available and that permissive open-source licenses often maximize availability and usefulness,” it says. “Open-source software is one important part of the software ecosystem.” What Microsoft wants, according to the document, is “neutral public procurement rules that allow governments to select software that offers them the greatest value.”\n\nBut security consultant Richard Forno, author of The Art of Information Warfare and other books, sees the GSP as representing no real change in Microsoft’s approach. It is, he believes, more a matter of perception than of substance: “My gut feeling is that it is to present the appearance of openness and getting some trust. It’s ‘shared’ source, but it’s not ‘open’ source.”\n\nAccording to Microsoft’s Matusow, about 60 nations’ governments have been approved for participation, and more than 30 are now on board. Approval under the GSP is granted largely on the basis of a country’s intellectual-property laws, which Microsoft says must be able to protect its copyrights.\n\nChina, in fact, seems to have been one of the earliest participants, even though the Chinese government is said to be leaning toward open-source procurement. Given China’s reputation on intellectual-property legal issues, this suggests some flexibility in Microsoft’s judgment of what it takes to protect its IP.\n\n“Steve Ballmer has made several trips over there, meeting with ministers and cabinet-level folks, trying to get them to tighten up their IP controls and regulations,” said Forno. “Obviously, that’s a huge market that Microsoft wants to break into, and I can understand their desire. But the last I heard, China is still proceeding with its own version of Linux and going with the open-source approach, for whatever reason. China certainly hasn’t improved its IP restrictions any.”\n\nBut according to Microsoft’s Matusow, “the GSP eligibility list continues to expand as more nations endeavor to bring their IP regimes into accord with international standards. The GSP agreement in China is the result of the ongoing commitment, partnership and investment Microsoft has already made in the Chinese software industry…. We have a very positive, dynamically growing relationship with the People’s Republic of China, including several joint initiatives.”\n\nMicrosoft says a million individuals now have access to Windows source code through various parts of the Shared Source Initiative. To the uninitiated, that may sound like cause for sleepless nights in a company famously protective of its designs. “The GSP goes well beyond simple source access,” Matusow told TechNewsWorld. “Trust and partnership don’t happen simply because of source code availability.”\n\nAnd, as Joe Wilcox pointed out, “I think it’s safe to assume that anyone outside of Microsoft given access to the source code sees it under very controlled circumstances.”\n\nAt a practical level, such control might be provided by the access mechanism, which involves use of a smart card allowing developers to inspect the code from approved locations in an SSL-protected online format. Additional practical protection may be afforded by the sheer volume of the code.\n\n“We’re talking about millions of lines of code,” Wilcox pointed out. “Nobody’s going to get a quick look at that and be able to steal Microsoft intellectual property.”Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing: Microsoft has historically wrung great profits from proprietary software licensing. Its business model, along with its substantial profit margins, is completely dependent upon licensing access to the software that it controls. In response to the growing market for open source and free software in the last 15 years, Microsoft has made clear that it has no intention of changing its approach. In fact, its public position and actions seem to signify that the company is becoming more aggressive about its licensing programs and about protecting its intellectual property through strategies such as patent procurement and litigation.\n\nYet, historically, Microsoft has provided at least some business partners and customers access to its source code, as well as obtained access to the source code of others for inclusion in its products, or for ensuring interoperability. New demands are also growing: as a result of open source, the developer community is increasingly used to having liberal access to whatever source code it needs to conduct business; governments and customers now expect to be able to audit the source code that makes up the products that they depend upon daily; and academics and start-ups alike understand that open source is an efficient way to conduct shared research projects. As the open source movement continues to gain steam, Microsoft, like many other software companies, has felt pressure to provide public access to its source code.\n\nMicrosoft cannot easily turn to existing open source licenses and communities in order to solve this problem. Large-scale proprietary software products represent a complex web of legal relationships between all of those who own copyrights, trademarks, and patents that apply not only to the code, but also to arcane elements such as the communications protocols and media formats being used. Were Microsoft to relicense its code, all participants would have to be contacted and terms renegotiated, or else replacement code would need to be written and tested. As described in Chapter 3, when Netscape open source licensed its proprietary Communicator software under the Mozilla Public License, it had to negotiate with third-party providers of code that had been part of the Communicator system and had to rewrite substantial sections of code when some of those providers refused to permit their code to be released under the MPL. This is a difficult process, even for the largest companies.\n\nBeyond the legal difficulties involved, Microsoft's software business model could not possibly sustain the blow to its profit margins that would occur should its software become freely available. Companies that generate income through services or hardware businesses can piggyback directly on open source by refocusing on those aspects of their business. But with almost all of its revenues derived from the licensing of proprietary software, Microsoft needs an approach to source code access that permits it to continue to use its current business model.\n\nThe Microsoft Shared Source Initiative is Microsoft's attempt to solve this source code access dilemma. The Shared Source Initiative has many facets, and it is difficult to describe briefly. It can be most simply explained as an umbrella under which Microsoft positions its many different software-licensing practices. On its face, it is a program for facilitating access to Microsoft source code, but, considered more broadly, it is also a lobbying effort aimed at explaining and defending the benefits of strong intellectual property laws to the world at large.\n\nWithin this system, Microsoft has defined five key source code licensing attributes:\n\nUsing these attributes, Microsoft has carefully tailored a number of software licenses that grant more or less restricted access to the source code for many of its software products, depending upon a number of variables such as what country the licensee resides in; how important the product is to Microsoft's core business; and whether the software is being used for commercial purposes, charitable use, or academic research. For some products, such as Windows, there may be literally dozens of different licensing options.\n\nBecause the Microsoft Shared Source Initiative is so complex, and each license is the result of relatively laborious negotiation within Microsoft and between Microsoft and its users and developers—with product and location specificity built into each license—the project has none of the simplicity or transparency of open source and free software licenses. It is, at least at this time, little more than a branded extension of Microsoft's current commercial licensing practices.\n\nWithin Microsoft's existing business ecosystem, however, the Shared Source Initiative has already borne copious amounts of fruit. Awareness of the initiative within Microsoft product teams has resulted in standardized and simplified ways for customers, subcontractors, support firms, hardware vendors, academic researchers, and governments to obtain access to code that would have been off-limits or very difficult to access in the past. It has also catalyzed internal analysis and product planning, which has resulted in deeper Microsoft participation in existing open source communities and processes.\n\nBeyond the edges of the ecosystem populated by Microsoft dependents, reaction to the Shared Source Initiative has been much more ambivalent. To many people, the program seems to be little more than a series of carefully scaled permissions governing access to Microsoft's closely guarded source code. Although some of the licenses involved allow for unfettered change and redistribution of underlying code, the code to which these licenses apply is not core application or operating system code. Developers have no real opportunity to make changes to such core assets without first agreeing to very restrictive terms. As a result, the resulting collaboration between Microsoft and external developers bears little relationship to the open source or open source-like development relationships described in this and previous chapters.\n\nDespite its readily apparent lack of enthusiasm for them, Microsoft has been actively following developments in the open source movement and slowly adapting to them via the Shared Source Initiative. Microsoft has begun to use existing open source licenses for some of its newer projects. Although these projects are minor at this point, the trend is very likely to continue because of the great advantages that open source has to offer, even to Microsoft, at least under certain circumstances. Microsoft is also beginning to understand how open source approaches can be \"safely\" integrated with its traditional business practices, and as a result of this, Microsoft's intellectual property agenda is likely to cause profound change within existing open source practices, through litigation, lobbying, lawmaking, and \"coopetition.\" Although Microsoft's positioning of shared source as an alternative to open source might seem absurd, it should not be lightly dismissed.\n\nIn terms of placing various licensing models on a spectrum, the GPL or the BSD-model license would fall on one end, depending on the nature of the \"freedom\" being measured; obviously, the classic proprietary license would fall upon the other, in terms of the restrictions imposed on licensees. In the continuum would fall the Perl, the MPL, the SCSL and the other licenses already described. The Microsoft Shared Source Initiative falls quite near the classic proprietary model in its function: not a surprising result, considering that Microsoft is by far history's largest beneficiary of the proprietary software licensing model. But, nonetheless, it has already, at least with regards to some applications, moved closer to a true open source model, and the Initiative is a project worth watching.\n\nAs this book was going to press, Microsoft released its Windows Installer XML (WiX) technology under the Common Public License (CPL), an Open Source Initiative-approved license, at http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/. This marks a first, though how far Microsoft will go with such projects is yet to be seen."}

UNESCO sponsors projects that improve literacy, provide technical training and education, advance science, protect independent media and press freedom, preserve regional and cultural history, and promote cultural diversity.[12][13][14] The organization prominently helps establish and secure World Heritage Sites of cultural and natural importance.[15]\n\nUNESCO is governed by the General Conference composed of member states and associate members, which meets biannually to set the agency's programs and budget. It also elects members of the executive board, which manages UNESCO's work, and appoints every four years a Director-General, who serves as UNESCO's chief administrator.\n\nUNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced back to a League of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a commission to study the feasibility of having nations freely share cultural, educational and scientific achievements.[16][17] This new body, the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC), was created in 1922[10] and counted such figures as Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Robert A. Millikan, and Gonzague de Reynold among its members (being thus a small commission of the League of Nations essentially centred on Western Europe[18]). The International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris in September 1924, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC.[19] However, the onset of World War II largely interrupted the work of these predecessor organizations.[20] As for private initiatives, the International Bureau of Education (IBE) began to work as a non-governmental organization in the service of international educational development since December 1925 and joined UNESCO in 1969, after having established a joint commission in 1952.[22]\n\nAfter the signing of the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United Nations, the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945. On 30 October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United States and the USSR. This was followed by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference proposals of 9 October 1944. Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO), held in San Francisco from April to June 1945, a United Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945 with 44 governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed by Rab Butler, the Minister of Education for the United Kingdom, who had a great deal of influence in its development.[23] At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory Commission was established.[24] The Preparatory Commission operated between 16 November 1945, and 4 November 1946 — the date when UNESCO's Constitution came into force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state.\n\nThe first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946, and elected Julian Huxley to Director-General.[26] United States Army colonel, university president and civil rights advocate Blake R. Van Leer joined as a member as well.[27] The Constitution was amended in November 1954 when the General Conference resolved that members of the executive board would be representatives of the governments of the States of which they are nationals and would not, as before, act in their personal capacity.[28] This change in governance distinguished UNESCO from its predecessor, the ICIC, in how member states would work together in the organization's fields of competence. As member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.[29][30]\n\nAmong the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism, for example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration of anthropologists (among them was Claude Lévi-Strauss) and other scientists in 1950 and concluding with the 1978 Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice.[31]\n\nIn 1955, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO saying that some of the organization's publications amounted to \"interference\" in the country's \"racial problems\".[32] It rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership of Nelson Mandela.[33][34]\n\nOne of the early work of UNESCO in the education field was a pilot project on fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, which was launched in 1947. Following this project one of expert missions to other countries, included a 1949 mission to Afghanistan.[35] UNESCO recommended in 1948 that Member countries should make free primary education compulsory and universal.[35] The World Conference on Education for All, in Jomtien, Thailand, started a global movement in 1990 to provide basic education for all children, youths and adults.[35] In 2000, World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, led member governments to commit for achieving basic education for all in 2015.[35]\n\nThe World Declaration on Higher Education was adopted by UNESCO's World Conference on Higher Education on 9 October 1998,[36] with the aim of setting global standards on the ideals and accessibility of higher education.\n\nUNESCO's early activities in culture included the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, launched in 1960.[37] The purpose of the campaign was to move the Great Temple of Abu Simbel to keep it from being swamped by the Nile after the construction of the Aswan Dam. During the 20-year campaign, 22 monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and largest in a series of campaigns including Mohenjo-daro (Pakistan), Fes (Morocco), Kathmandu (Nepal), Borobudur (Indonesia) and the Acropolis of Athens (Greece).[38] The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in 1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.[39] In 1976, the World Heritage Committee was established and the first sites were included on the World Heritage List in 1978.[40] Since then important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage)[41] and 2005 (Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions).[42]\n\nAn intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible for establishing the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)[43] later on, in 1954.[44]\n\nArid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO project in the field of natural sciences.[45]\n\nIn 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at reconciling the environment and development, a problem that continues to be addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the 1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme.[46]\n\nUNESCO has been credited with the diffusion of national science bureaucracies.[47]\n\nIn the field of communication, the \"free flow of ideas by word and image\" has been in UNESCO's constitution since it was established, following the experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in indoctrinating populations for aggression.[48] In the years immediately following World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world. UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.[48] In response to calls for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" in the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems,[49] which produced the 1980 MacBride report (named after the chair of the commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Seán MacBride).[49] The same year, UNESCO created the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote media development in developing countries.[50] In 1993, UNESCO's General Conference endorsed the Windhoek Declaration on media independence and pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its adoption, 3 May, as World Press Freedom Day.[51] Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded the UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize every 3 May.[52]\n\nLaws passed in the United States after Palestine applied for UNESCO and WHO membership in April 1989[55][56] mean that the United States cannot contribute financially to any UN organization that accepts Palestine as a full member.[57][58] As a result, the United States withdrew its funding, which had accounted for about 22% of UNESCO's budget.[59] Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to UNESCO by freezing Israeli payments to UNESCO and imposing sanctions on the Palestinian Authority,[60] stating that Palestine's admittance would be detrimental \"to potential peace talks\".[61] Two years after stopping payment of its dues to UNESCO, the United States and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights in 2013 without losing the right to be elected; thus, the United States was elected as a member of the executive board for the period 2016–19.[62] In 2019, Israel left UNESCO after 69 years of membership, with Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon writing: \"UNESCO is the body that continually rewrites history, including by erasing the Jewish connection to Jerusalem... it is corrupted and manipulated by Israel's enemies... we are not going to be a member of an organization that deliberately acts against us\".[63]\n\n2023 saw Russia excluded from the executive committee for the first time, after failing to get sufficient votes.[64] The United States stated its intent to rejoin UNESCO in 2023, 5 years after leaving, and to pay its $600 million in back dues.[65] The United States was readmitted by the UNESCO General Conference that July.[66]\n\nUNESCO implements its activities through five programme areas: education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.[67]\n• UNESCO supports research in comparative education, provides expertise and fosters partnerships to strengthen national educational leadership and the capacity of countries to offer quality education for all. This includes the\n• UNESCO Chairs, an international network of 644 UNESCO chairs, involving more than 770 institutions in 126 countries\n• Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted in 1960\n• Organization of the International Conference on Adult Education (CONFINTEA) in an interval of 12 years\n• Publication of the Education for All Global Monitoring Report\n• Publication of the Four Pillars of Learning seminal document\n• UNESCO ASPNet, an international network of more than 12,000 schools in 182 countries\n\nUNESCO does not accredit institutions of higher learning.[68]\n• UNESCO also issues public statements to educate the public:\n• Seville Statement on Violence: A statement adopted by UNESCO in 1989 to refute the notion that humans are biologically predisposed to organized violence.\n• Designating projects and places of cultural and scientific significance, such as:\n• Biosphere reserves, through the Programme on Man and the Biosphere (MAB), since 1971\n• City of Literature; in 2007, the first city to be given this title was Edinburgh, the site of Scotland's first circulating library. 69 In 2008, Iowa City, Iowa, became the City of Literature. 70 71\n• Endangered languages and linguistic diversity projects (UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger)\n• Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\n• Memory of the World International Register, since 1997\n• Water resources management, through the International Hydrological Programme (IHP), since 1965\n• Encouraging the \"free flow of ideas by images and words\" by:\n• Promoting freedom of expression, including freedom of the press and freedom of information legislation, through the Division of Freedom of Expression and Media Development, 72 including the International Programme for the Development of Communication 73\n• Promoting the safety of journalists and combatting impunity for those who attack them, 74 through coordination of the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity 75\n• Promoting universal access to and preservation of information and open solutions for sustainable development through the Knowledge Societies Division, 76 including the Memory of the World Programme 77 and Information for All Programme 78\n• Promoting pluralism, gender equality and cultural diversity in the media\n• Promoting Internet Universality and its principles, that the Internet should be (I) human Rights-based, (ii) Open, (iii) Accessible to all, and (iv) nurtured by Multi-stakeholder participation (summarized as the acronym R.O.A.M.) 79\n• Generating knowledge through publications such as World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development, 80 the UNESCO Series on Internet Freedom, 81 and the Media Development Indicators, 82 as well as other indicator-based studies.\n• Promoting events, such as:\n• International Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World: 2001–2010, proclaimed by the UN in 1998\n• World Press Freedom Day, 3 May each year, to promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press as a basic human right and as crucial components of any healthy, democratic and free society.\n• Criança Esperança in Brazil, in partnership with Rede Globo, to raise funds for community-based projects that foster social integration and violence prevention.\n• International Year for the Culture of Peace, 2000\n• Health Education for Behavior Change programme in partnership with the Ministry of Education of Kenya which was financially supported by the Government of Azerbaijan to promote health education among 10-19-year-old young people who live in informal camp in Kibera, Nairobi.

These two distinct sets of information are published on the IATI registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI Organization Standard.\n\nThere have been proposals to establish two new UNESCO lists. The first proposed list will focus on movable cultural heritage such as artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list may include cultural objects, such as the Jōmon Venus of Japan, the Mona Lisa of France, the Gebel el-Arak Knife of Egypt, The Ninth Wave of Russia, the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük of Turkey, the David (Michelangelo) of Italy, the Mathura Herakles of India, the Manunggul Jar of the Philippines, the Crown of Baekje of South Korea, The Hay Wain of the United Kingdom and the Benin Bronzes of Nigeria. The second proposed list will focus on the world's living species.[89][90]\n\nUNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.\n\nCreated in 1945, The UNESCO Courier magazine states its mission to \"promote UNESCO's ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and provide a forum for international debate\". Since March 2006 it has been available free online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO. There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.[91]\n\nIn 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review Impact of Science on Society (also known as Impact) to discuss the influence of science on society. The journal ceased publication in 1992.[92] UNESCO also published Museum International Quarterly from the year 1948.\n\nUNESCO has official relations with 322 international non-governmental organizations (NGOs).[93] Most of these are what UNESCO calls \"operational\"; a select few are \"formal\".[94] The highest form of affiliation to UNESCO is \"formal associate\", and the 22 NGOs[95] with formal associate (ASC) relations occupying offices at UNESCO are:\n\nThe institutes are specialized departments of the organization that support UNESCO's programme, providing specialized support for cluster and national offices.\n\nUNESCO awards 26 prizes[108] in education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, communication and information as well as peace:\n• UNESCO/Hamdan Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum Prize for Outstanding Practice and Performance in Enhancing the Effectiveness of Teachers\n• UNESCO King Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa Prize for the Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Education\n• UNESCO/Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science\n• UNESCO-Equatorial Guinea International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences\n• UNESCO-Al Fozan International Prize for the Promotion of Young Scientists in STEM\n• UNESCO/Juan Bosch Prize for the Promotion of Social Science Research in Latin America and the Caribbean\n• UNESCO-Madanjeet Singh Prize for the Promotion of Tolerance and Non-Violence\n• Melina Mercouri International Prize for the Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes (UNESCO-Greece)\n• UNESCO/Emir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah Prize to promote Quality Education for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities\n• UNESCO/Obiang Nguema Mbasogo International Prize for Research in the Life Sciences (inactive since 2010)\n• UNESCO Prize for the Promotion of the Arts\n\nInternational Days observed at UNESCO are provided in the table below:[111]\n\nAs of July 2023 , UNESCO has 194 member states and 12 associate members.[122] Some members are not independent states and some members have additional National Organizing Committees from some of their dependent territories.[123] UNESCO state parties are the United Nations member states (except Israel[124] and Liechtenstein), as well as Cook Islands, Niue and Palestine.[125][126] The United States and Israel left UNESCO on 31 December 2018,[127][128] but the United States rejoined in 2023.[65][66]\n\nAs of June 2023 , there have been 11 Directors-General of UNESCO since its inception – nine men and two women. The 11 Directors-General of UNESCO have come from six regions within the organization: West Europe (5), Central America (1), North America (2), West Africa (1), East Asia (1), and East Europe (1).\n\nTo date, there has been no elected Director-General from the remaining ten regions within UNESCO: Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and North Asia, Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, Australia-Oceania, and South America.\n\nThe list of the Directors-General of UNESCO since its establishment in 1946 is as follows:[129]\n\nThis is the list of the sessions of the UNESCO General Conference held since 1946:[130]\n\nBiennial elections are held, with 58 elected representatives holding office for four years.\n\nThe UNESCO headquarters is located at Place de Fontenoy in Paris, France. Several architects collaborated on the construction of the headquarters, including Bernard Zehrfuss, Marcel Breuer and Luigi Nervi.[140] It includes a Garden of Peace which was donated by the Government of Japan.[141] This garden was designed by American-Japanese sculptor artist Isamu Noguchi in 1958 and installed by Japanese gardener Toemon Sano. In 1994–1995, in memory of the 50th anniversary of UNESCO, a meditation room was built by Tadao Ando.[142]\n\nUNESCO's field offices across the globe are categorized into four primary office types based upon their function and geographic coverage: cluster offices, national offices, regional bureaus and liaison offices.\n\nThe following list of all UNESCO Field Offices is organized geographically by UNESCO Region and identifies the members states and associate members of UNESCO which are served by each office.[143]\n• Addis Ababa – Liaison Office with the African Union and with the Economic Commission for Africa\n• Brazzaville – National Office to the Republic of the Congo\n• Dakar – Regional Bureau for Education in Africa and Cluster Office for Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal\n• Kinshasa – National Office to the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n• Libreville – Cluster Office for the Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe\n• Nairobi – Regional Bureau for Sciences in Africa and Cluster Office for Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda\n• Beirut – Regional Bureau for Education in the Arab States and Cluster Office to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Palestine\n• Cairo – Regional Bureau for Sciences in the Arab States and Cluster Office for Egypt and Sudan\n• Iraq – National Office for Iraq (currently located in Amman, Jordan)\n• Apia – Cluster Office to Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Tokelau (Associate Member)\n• Bangkok – Regional Bureau for Education in Asia and the Pacific and Cluster Office to Thailand, Burma, Laos, Singapore and Vietnam\n• Beijing – Cluster Office to North Korea, Japan, Mongolia, the People's Republic of China and South Korea\n• Jakarta – Regional Bureau for Sciences in Asia and the Pacific and Cluster Office to the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and East Timor\n• New Delhi – Cluster Office to Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka\n• Brussels – Liaison Office to the European Union and its subsidiary bodies in Brussels\n• Geneva – Liaison Office to the United Nations in Geneva\n• New York City – Liaison Office to the United Nations in New York\n• Venice – Regional Bureau for Sciences and Culture in Europe\n• Havana – Regional Bureau for Culture in Latin America and the Caribbean and Cluster Office to Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Aruba\n• Kingston – Cluster Office to Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago as well as the associate member states of British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Curaçao and Sint Maarten\n• Montevideo – Regional Bureau for Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean and Cluster Office to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay\n• Santiago de Chile – Regional Bureau for Education in Latin America and the Caribbean and National Office to Chile\n\nUNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the former Soviet Union. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" and its MacBride report calling for democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was condemned in these countries as attempts to curb freedom of the press. UNESCO was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.[147] In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in 1985.[148] Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership fees.[149] Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.[150]\n\nUNESCO has been criticized as being used by the People's Republic of China to present a Chinese Communist Party version of history and to dilute the contributions of ethnic minorities in China such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.[151][152][153]\n\nIsrael was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has maintained its membership since then. In 2010, Israel designated the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem – both in the West Bank – as National Heritage Sites and announced restoration work, prompting criticism from the Obama administration and protests from Palestinians.[154] In October 2010, UNESCO's executive board voted to declare the sites as \"al-Haram al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs\" and \"Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb\" and stated that they were \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian Territories\" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of international law.[155] UNESCO described the sites as significant to \"people of the Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions\", and accused Israel of highlighting only the Jewish character of the sites.[156] Israel in turn accused UNESCO of \"detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage\", and accused it of being politically motivated.[157] The Rabbi of the Western Wall said that Rachel's tomb had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site.[158] Israel partially suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon declared that the resolution was a \"part of Palestinian escalation\". Zevulun Orlev, chairman of the Knesset Education and Culture Committee, referred to the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the world.[159][160]\n\nOn 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at Jordan's insistence, censured[clarification needed] Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the Mughrabi Gate Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement, saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to address the UNESCO committee over objections from Egypt.[161]\n\nIn January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-General, Irina Bokova, \"indefinitely postponed\" and effectively cancelled an exhibit created by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre entitled \"The People, The Book, The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the Jewish people and the Land of Israel\". The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at UNESCO argued that its display would \"harm the peace process\".[162] The author of the exhibition, professor Robert Wistrich of the Hebrew University's Vidal Sassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism, called the cancellation an \"appalling act\", and characterized Bokova's decision as \"an arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people and its history\". UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.[163]\n\nOn 1 January 2019, Israel formally left UNESCO in pursuance of the US withdrawal over perceived continuous anti-Israel bias.[164]\n\nOn 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that condemned Israel for \"aggressions\" by Israeli police and soldiers and \"illegal measures\" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision.[165] While the text acknowledged the \"importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions\", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name \"Al-Haram al-Sharif\", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response, Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words \"Temple Mount\" or \"Har HaBayit\", stating that it denies Jewish ties to the key holy site.[165][166] After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and diplomats, including Benjamin Netanyahu and Ayelet Shaked, Israel froze all ties with the organization.[167][168] The resolution was condemned by Ban Ki-moon and the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and \"to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site.[169][170] \"Al-Aqsa Mosque [or] Al-Haram al-Sharif\" is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism.\"[171] It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a \"hateful anti-Israel sentiment\",[172] and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention.[172] On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous \"refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status\".[173] Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text.[174] The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name – a significant semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines stated: \"This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO.\"[175]\n\nIn October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.[176][177]\n\nIn February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in which a teenage girl described one of her four role models as Adolf Hitler. In December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the material and subsequently withdrew support.[178]\n\nIn 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the Islamic University of Gaza in the field of astronomy, astrophysics, and space sciences,[179] fueling controversy and criticism. Israel bombed the school in 2008 stating that they develop and store weapons there, which Israel restated in criticizing UNESCO's move.[180][181]\n\nThe head, Kamalain Shaath, defended UNESCO, stating that \"the Islamic University is a purely academic university that is interested only in education and its development\".[182][183][184] Israeli ambassador to UNESCO Nimrod Barkan planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the university's ties to Hamas, especially angry that this was the first Palestinian university that UNESCO chose to cooperate with.[185] The Jewish organization B'nai B'rith criticized the move as well.[186]\n\nIn 2015, Japan threatened to halt funding of UNESCO because of the organization's decision to include documents related to the 1937 Nanjing massacre in the latest listing for its \"Memory of the World\" program.[187] In October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that Japan's 2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended, although he denied any direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.[188]\n\nThe United States withdrew from UNESCO in 1984, citing the \"highly politicized\" nature of the organization, its ostensible \"hostility toward the basic institutions of a free society, especially a free market and a free press\", as well as its \"unrestrained budgetary expansion\", and poor management under then Director-General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal.[189]\n\nOn 19 September 1989, US Congressman Jim Leach stated before a congressional subcommittee:[190]\n\nLeach concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the impetuses behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before departing from UNESCO, a withdrawal from the IAEA had been pushed on him.[190] On 1 October 2003, the United States rejoined UNESCO.[189]\n\nOn 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO it would again withdraw from the organization, on 31 December 2018; Israel followed suit.[191] The Department of State cited \"mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO\".[176]\n\nThe United States has not paid over $600 million in dues[192] since it stopped paying its $80 million annual UNESCO dues when Palestine became a full member in 2011. Israel and the United States were among the 14 votes against the membership out of 194 member countries.[193] When the United States announced it was rejoining the body in 2023, it also pledged to pay all past-due payments.[65]\n\nOn 25 May 2016, Turkish poet and human rights activist Zülfü Livaneli resigned as Turkey's only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted the human rights situation in Turkey and the destruction of the historical Sur district of Diyarbakir, the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons for his resignation. Livaneli said: \"To pontificate on peace while remaining silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of UNESCO.\"[194]\n\nIn 2020 UNESCO stated that the size of the illicit trade in cultural property amounted to 10 billion dollars a year. A report that same year by the Rand Organization suggested the actual market is \"not likely to be larger than a few hundred million dollars each year\". An expert cited by UNESCO as attributing the 10 billion figure denied it, saying he had \"no idea\" where the figure came from. Art dealers were particularly critical of the UNESCO figure because it amounted to 15% of the total world art market.[195]\n\nIn November 2020, part of a UNESCO advertising campaign intended to highlight international trafficking in looted artefacts had to be withdrawn after it falsely presented a series of museum-held artworks with known provenances as recently looted objects held in private collections. The adverts claimed that a head of Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's collection since 1930 had been looted from a Kabul Museum in 2001 and then smuggled into the US art market, that a funerary monument from Palmyra that the Met had acquired in 1901 had been recently looted from the Palmyra Museum by Islamic State militants and then smuggled into the European antiquities market, and that an Ivory Coast mask with a provenance that indicates it was in the United States by 1954 was looted during armed clashes in 2010–2011. After complaints by the Met, the adverts were withdrawn.[196]\n• UNESDOC Database 197 – Contains more than 146,000 UNESCO documents in full text published since 1945 as well as metadata from the collections of the UNESCO Library and documentation centres in field offices and institutes.\n\nUNESCO develops, maintains, and disseminates, free of charge, two interrelated software packages for database management (CDS/ISIS [not to be confused with UK police software package ISIS]) and data mining/statistical analysis (IDAMS).[198]\n• CDS/ISIS – a generalized information storage and retrieval system.

It was declared a national park in 1981 and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986. It occupies 40 km2 (15 sq mi) and it extends into each of the six municipalities on the island.\n\nNearly 450,000 tourists visit the park every year. There is accommodation for tourists just outside the park's boundary.[1]\n\nThe park is named after the rock formation of Garajonay, the highest point on the island at 1,487 metres (4,879 ft). It also includes a small plateau whose altitude is 790–1,400 metres (2,590–4,590 ft) above sea level. Features of the national park include the massive rocks that are found along the island. These are former volcanoes whose shapes have been carved by erosion. Some, like the \"Fortaleza\" (fortress in Spanish) were considered sacred by the native islanders, as well as ideal refuges when attacked.[2] The park is crossed by a large network of 18 footpaths, trekking being one of the main tourist activities in the island.\n\nMany of the species of flora and fauna are endemic to the Macaronesian islands, the Canary Islands or La Gomera, and the Garajonay forest harbors a rich biota of understory plants, invertebrates, and birds and bats, including a large number of endemic species. The park provides the best example of Canarian laurisilva, a humid subtropical forest that in the Tertiary covered almost all of Southern Europe. It is also found on the Azores and the Madeira Islands. Laurus azorica, known as Azores laurel, or by the Portuguese names louro, loureiro, louro-da-terra, and louro-de-cheiro, can be found in the park, as well as Laurus novocanariensis, known as Canary laurel. Although named as a single type of forest, the national park englobes several varieties of forests. Most humid and protected valleys oriented to the North have the richest and most complex forests. It is known as valley laurisilva, a true subtropical rainforest where the largest laurel trees can be found. At higher altitudes, with less protection from wind and sun, the forest loses some of its more delicate species. Here it is called slope laurisilva (laurisilva de ladera). At the south the forest is mainly a mix of beech and heather, species adapted to the less humid atmosphere. In August 2012, a forest fire burned 747 hectares (18%) of this national park.[3]\n\nTwo species of reptile, Gallotia gomerana (Gomeran lizard) and Chalcides viridanus (Gomeran skink), can be found. Amphibians include the stripeless tree frog, Hyla meridionalis. The park is renowned as one of the best places to observe the two Canarian endemic pigeons, laurel pigeon (Columba junoniae) and Bolle's pigeon (Columba bollii). The park has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of various birds. As well as the two endemic pigeon species, these include Barbary partridges, plain swifts, Eurasian sparrowhawks, Berthelot's pipits and island canaries.[4]\n\nThe peak and park are named after Guanche lore, the hapless lovers Gara and Jonay. Their romance evokes those of Romeo and Juliet and Hero and Leander. Gara was a princess of Agulo on La Gomera. During the festival of Beñesmén, it was customary for unmarried girls of Agulo to gaze at their reflections in the waters of Chorros del Epina. If the water was clear, they would find a husband; if it was cloudy, some misfortune would befall them. When Gara looked at the water, she saw her reflection clearly. However, she gazed too long and the sun's reflection blinded her temporarily. A wise man named Gerián told her that this meant that she needed to avoid all fire or else it would consume her.\n\nJonay was the son of the Guanche mencey or king of Adeje on Tenerife, who arrived on the island to celebrate these ceremonies. Jonay's participation in the ensuing games attracted the attention of Gara, and the two fell in love. Unfortunately, when the engagement was announced, the volcano Teide, visible from La Gomera, began to erupt as if in disapproval. This was interpreted as a bad omen and the couple’s respective parents broke the engagement. Jonay was made to return to Tenerife, but one night, he swam across the channel that separated the two islands and rejoined his beloved. Their respective fathers ordered that the two be found. The lovers were soon trapped on a mountain, where they decided to take their own lives.\n• The park's wooden statues of Gara and Jonay\n• Guanche Sanctuary in the summit of Garajonay mountain.Parque Nacional de Garajonay: Introducción general al uso de cookies en el portal MITECO.gob.es\n\nLas cookies son archivos que se pueden descargar en su equipo a través de las páginas web.

Protege un bosque emblemático de nuestro país: la laurisilva o Monteverde. Un ecosistema que nos llega del Terciario, con una flora superviviente de las selvas subtropicales que poblaron la cuenca mediterránea hace millones de años\n\nSu declaración como Parque Nacional en 1981 y Patrimonio Mundial por la UNESCO 5 años más tarde, reconocen el valor del Monteverde canario como uno de los bosques más antiguos de Europa. Frecuentes nieblas traídas por los vientos alisios han permitido su existencia, inimaginable sin la presencia casi permanente de la humedad aportada por las nubes. La llamada lluvia horizontal empapa las hojas perennes de forma similar a la del laurel, que dan el nombre de laurisilva a este singular bosque-esponja. Garajonay se extiende entre los 800 y los 1.487 m de altitud, donde se halla la máxima altura de la isla.\n\nDe origen volcánico, la ausencia de actividad eruptiva en La Gomera durante los últimos 2 millones de años, y un clima que propicia la erosión, han creado un relieve surcado por profundos barrancos. En ellos se refugia un gran número de especies endémicas de flora y fauna, y sobresalen los espectaculares Roques, que apenas interrumpen el denso y verde manto vegetal.\n\nLa pregunta que se hacen muchos visitantes de Garajonay es porqué no hay animales grandes. La respuesta es que la fauna nativa de las islas está limitada por el aislamiento del continente, que impide la colonización de estos animales. Por ello, la fauna vertebrada se limita a aves y murciélagos, que con su capacidad de vuelo si pudieron llegar hasta aquí. Las aves son, por lo tanto, los vertebrados más numerosos. Un total de 28 especies de aves crían en Garajonay. Es frecuente escuchar y ver al mirlo común entre la espesura, y avistar de forma fugaz a pinzones, mosquiteros, herrerillos y reyezuelos. Pero de todas las especies de aves de Garajonay, las más representativas son las palomas endémicas de Canarias, las palomas turqué y rabiche, que se alimentan de los frutos de los árboles del bosque. Sin embargo, la gran riqueza faunística de Garajonay está sobre todo en la fauna invertebrada, que tiene un elevado número de endemismos.\n\nLa Gomera, a diferencia de las restantes islas de Canarias, es una isla sin actividad volcánica reciente, caracterizada por profundos barrancos excavados por la erosión. En sus cumbres se conserva un extraordinario bosque de laurisilva, incluido en su mayor parte en el Parque Nacional de Garajonay, cuya frondosidad contrasta con la aridez dominante en el resto de la isla. La laurisilva es una reliquia de la Era Terciaria, que conserva parte de la flora que entonces ocupaba buena parte de Europa, y que desapareció del continente tras profundos cambios en el clima, que afectaron en menor medida a las Islas Canarias. Hoy es un ecosistema propio de la llamada Región Macaronésica, que incluye, junto con las islas Canarias, a Madeira, Azores y Cabo Verde, aunque en este último Archipiélago, la laurisilva está ausente. La Laurisilva es excepcional en su ámbito geográfico, pues los bosques que se les asemejan se encuentran en áreas muy alejadas del Planeta, en el sureste asiático o las montañas del trópico húmedo.\n\nEn las áreas más lluviosas del Parque, las precipitaciones superan los 900 mm anuales, propiciando un paisaje de bosques densos surcado por pequeñas y grandes caídas de agua y riachuelos que descienden hacia los fondos de valle. Uno de los cursos de agua más conocidos de Garajonay es el barranco del Cedro. La laurisilva es crucial como productora de agua en una isla de características áridas. Su capacidad para retener y almacenar agua al paso de las masas de aire con humedad, es fundamental para la recarga hidrológica. Ello explica que por el Parque Nacional fluya la red de corrientes de agua permanente más amplia y mejor conservada de Canarias.\n\nDentro del conjunto forestal de Garajonay, destacan unos afloramientos de rocas modelados por la erosión: los roques y fortalezas. Son domos volcánicos de escarpadas paredes rocosas, los primeros de base estrecha y puntiagudos, y los segundos en forma de meseta. Se trata del relleno de antiguos conductos volcánicos puestos en resalte por la erosión durante millones de años de los materiales circundantes más erosionables. En estos lugares encuentran refugio numerosas especies vegetales rupícolas, muchas de ellas endémicas. Entre los roques destacan los de Agando, Ojila, La Zarcita y Carmona, y entre las fortalezas la de Chipude, próxima al Parque, y la de Cherelepin. Podemos observar estos monumentos geológicos muy de cerca desde algunos miradores ubicados en la carretera que atraviesa el Parque Nacional.\n\nAntes de la llegada de los europeos en el siglo XV, La Gomera estaba habitada y dividida en cuatro cantones, ubicados en los cuatro grandes barrancos de la isla. Sus pobladores procedían del norte de África. Del bosque obtenían carbón, leña y, sobre todo, agua. Su economía se basaba en la ganadería y la recolección y habitaban en cuevas o en pequeñas cabañas. Se han encontrados restos arqueológicos ligados a la celebración de sus rituales.\n\nDesde su colonización en el siglo XV, se convierte en parada obligada para las rutas hacia las recién descubiertas tierras americanas. Cristóbal Colón recaló en su costa en varias ocasiones. Un régimen feudal aísla La Gomera prácticamente hasta el siglo XIX. Durante esos años, se establece una normativa de uso para la obtención de rentas que evita la degradación del bosque.\n\nA mediados del siglo XX se elimina el ganado del monte y se reducen los aprovechamientos forestales. Los avatares históricos, junto con la iniciativa conservacionista de la población local, han permitido la supervivencia de árboles centenarios que podemos contemplar en pleno siglo XXI.\n\nUna de las manifestaciones antropológicas más singulares de la Gomera es una original y exclusiva forma de comunicación, conocida como silbo gomero, que sólo existe en la isla. Su origen procede de la dificultad de los antiguos pobladores para comunicarse debido al accidentado relieve de la Gomera.\n\nEn 2009 fue declarado por la UNESCO Patrimonio Inmaterial de la Humanidad.Patrimonio de la Humanidad - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Patrimonio Mundial, más conocido como Patrimonio de la Humanidad, es el título conferido por la Unesco a sitios específicos del planeta (sean bosque, montaña, lago, laguna, cueva, desierto, edificación, complejo arquitectónico, ruta cultural, paisaje cultural o ciudad) que han sido propuestos y confirmados para su inclusión en la lista mantenida por el programa Patrimonio Mundial, administrado por el Comité del Patrimonio Mundial, compuesto por 21 Estados miembros a los que elige la Asamblea General de Estados miembros por un periodo determinado.[1]​\n\nEl objetivo del programa es catalogar, preservar y dar a conocer sitios de importancia cultural o natural excepcional para la herencia común de la humanidad. Bajo ciertas condiciones, los sitios mencionados pueden obtener financiación para su conservación del Fondo para la conservación del Patrimonio mundial. Fue fundado por la Convención para la cooperación internacional en la protección de la herencia cultural y natural de la humanidad, que posteriormente fue adoptada por la conferencia general de la Unesco el 16 de noviembre de 1972. Desde entonces, 193 Estados miembros han ratificado la convención.\n\nPara julio de 2024, el catálogo consta de un total de 1223 sitios del Patrimonio Mundial, de los cuales 952 son culturales, 231 naturales y 40 mixtos, distribuidos en 168 países.[2]​Por cantidad de sitios inscritos, los diez primeros países son: Italia (60 sitios), China (59 sitios), Alemania (54 sitios), Francia (53 sitios), España (50 sitios), India (43 sitios), México y Reino Unido (ambos con 35 sitios), Rusia (32 sitios) e Irán (28 sitios).[3]​ Algunas de las regiones subnacionales con más bienes culturales Patrimonio Mundial son Castilla y León y Andalucía (España), con 8; junto con las regiones de la Toscana, la Lombardía y el Véneto (Italia), las tres con 8 o más bienes.[4]​[5]​[6]​\n\nHistóricamente, la inscripción de los dos primeros bienes registrados en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en 1978, el centro histórico de Quito y las islas Galápagos, ambas ubicadas en Ecuador, se celebra cada 3 de diciembre en la Sede de la Unesco en París. Las islas Galápagos poseen la distinción de ser el primer bien natural declarado Patrimonio Mundial, mientras que el centro histórico de Quito, junto con el de Cracovia (Polonia), fueron los primeros centros históricos inscritos en la Lista.[7]​[8]​\n\nLa Unesco se refiere a cada sitio con un número de identificación único, pero las nuevas inscripciones incluyen a menudo los sitios anteriores ahora enumerados como parte de descripciones más grandes. Consecuentemente, el sistema de numeración termina actualmente sobre 1500, aunque realmente haya 1092 catalogados; con el añadido de que muchos de los Patrimonios de la Humanidad se encuentran en múltiples ubicaciones, siendo el mismo sitio, principalmente aquellos que son rutas culturales, conjuntos de un mismo concepto de sitio natural protegido, o paisajes culturales.\n\nCada sitio Patrimonio Mundial pertenece al país en el que se localiza, pero se considera en el interés de la comunidad internacional y debe ser preservado para las futuras generaciones. La protección y la conservación de estos sitios son una preocupación de los 122 Estados miembros de la Unesco.\n\nEn 1959, el gobierno de Egipto decidió construir la presa de Asuán, lo que generaría la inundación del valle en el que se encontraban tesoros de enorme valor arqueológico e histórico como los templos de Abu Simbel. Entonces la Unesco lanzó una campaña internacional de protección de estos tesoros. Los templos de Abu Simbel y de File fueron desmontados, transportados a un sitio más alto y reconstruidos con exactitud pieza por pieza.\n\nEl costo del proyecto fue de aproximadamente 80 millones de dólares estadounidenses, de los cuales casi la mitad fue obtenida de 50 países. Se consideró ampliamente un éxito y esto llevó al desarrollo de nuevas campañas de protección, como la de salvar Venecia y su laguna, las ruinas de Mohenjo-Daro en Pakistán o el templo Borobudur en Indonesia. La Unesco propugnó así, junto con el Consejo Internacional de Monumentos y Sitios, una convención para proteger el patrimonio cultural común de la humanidad.\n\nLos Estados Unidos iniciaron la idea de combinar la conservación cultural con la conservación natural. En una conferencia de la Casa Blanca en 1965 se pidió por una \"entidad para el patrimonio de la humanidad\" para preservar \"las áreas naturales y sitios históricos del mundo para el presente y futuro de toda la humanidad\". En 1968 la Unión Mundial para la Conservación desarrolló propuestas similares, que fueron presentadas en 1972 en una conferencia de Naciones Unidas sobre ambiente humano en Estocolmo, Suecia.\n\nUn solo texto fue aprobado por todas las partes, y la Convención sobre la Protección del Patrimonio Mundial Cultural y Natural fue adoptada por la Conferencia General de la Unesco en su XVII reunión celebrada en París el 16 de noviembre de 1972.\n\nEl Comité del Patrimonio Mundial se reúne una vez al año, y se compone de representantes de 21 de los Estados Partes elegidos por la Asamblea General. En su primera sesión, el Comité aprobó su Reglamento Interno del Comité del Patrimonio Mundial. Este Comité de 21 miembros, es responsable de la aplicación de la Convención del Patrimonio Mundial, define el uso del Fondo del Patrimonio Mundial y asigna ayuda financiera a petición de los Estados. Tiene la última palabra sobre si una propiedad estará inscrita en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial. Examina los informes sobre el estado de conservación de los bienes inscritos y pide la toma de medidas correspondientes a los países cuando los sitios inscritos no están siendo manejados adecuadamente. También decide sobre la inscripción o supresión de bienes en la Lista del Patrimonio Mundial en Peligro.[9]​\n\nEn 2021, los 21 miembros del Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad, son:\n\nEl Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad se reúne varias veces al año para discutir medidas sobre la gestión de los sitios Patrimonio de la Humanidad existentes, y aceptar las candidaturas de los países interesados. En una sesión anual, conocida como la Sesión del Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad, es donde los sitios son oficialmente inscritos en la lista de Patrimonio de la Humanidad, luego de presentaciones hechas por la UMC o el CIMS, y deliberaciones de los Estados miembros. La sesión anual se celebra en ciudades alrededor del mundo. Con la excepción de aquellas celebradas en París, donde se ubica la sede central de la Unesco, solo los Estados miembros del Comité tienen derecho a celebrar una sesión futura del Comité en su territorio, previa aprobación del Comité.[1]​\n\nDesde 1977 hasta 2024, el Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad ha celebrado 46 sesiones ordinarias y diez sesiones extraordinarias.\n\nEl proceso comienza cuando un país desarrolla un inventario con todos sus sitios con características naturales o culturales significativas para ser incluidos en la Lista Provisional,[10]​ y es importante porque un país no puede nominar un sitio que no haya estado incluido en esta. A continuación, puede seleccionar un sitio de esta lista para ubicarla en un Expediente de Candidatura. El Centro del Patrimonio de la Humanidad ofrece ayuda en la confección de este expediente, el cual debe ser lo más completo posible.\n\nPosteriormente el expediente es evaluado independientemente por dos organizaciones: La Unión Internacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (UICN) y el Consejo Internacional de Monumentos y Sitios (ICOMOS, por sus siglas en inglés). Estas entidades elevan después sus recomendaciones al Comité del Patrimonio de la Humanidad. El Comité se reúne una vez al año para determinar si incluir o no cada sitio candidato en la lista definitiva, y a veces aplaza su decisión para solicitar más información a los Estados miembros. Hay diez criterios que un sitio debe cumplir, en uno o más puntos, para ser incluido en la lista.\n\nA finales de 2004, había un grupo de seis criterios en el ámbito cultural y otros cuatro en el ámbito natural. En 2005, esto se modificó y se unieron para que hubiera un único grupo de diez criterios (los 6 primeros para bienes culturales y los 4 últimos para bienes naturales). Para ser incluido en la lista del Patrimonio de la Humanidad, un sitio debe tener un \"valor universal excepcional\" y debe satisfacer al menos uno de los siguientes criterios de selección:[11]​\n\nDesde 1992 la interacción entre el hombre y el medio ambiente es reconocido como paisaje cultural.\n\nHasta julio de 2019 existen 1121 sitios declarados Patrimonio Mundial en 167 Estados miembros. De estos, 869 son culturales, 213 naturales y 39 son mixtos. De estos, 37 se consideran transfronterizos, lo que significa que pertenecen a más de 1 país.\n\nLa Unesco ha establecido una clasificación geográfica de los sitios declarados Patrimonio de la Humanidad en la que distingue cinco áreas: África (no incluye los países de los Estados árabes), América Latina y el Caribe[12]​ (incluye a Isla de Pascua), Asia y Oceanía (no incluye los Estados árabes),[13]​Estados árabes (incluye además una zona de Jerusalén propuesta por Jordania),[14]​y Europa y América del Norte (no incluye a México; este grupo incluye a Israel, Turquía, Rusia y Hawái).[15]​\n\nLos zonas geográficas de la Unesco dan, además, mayor énfasis en lo administrativo que a las asociaciones geográficas. Por ejemplo Israel, que geográficamente está ubicado en Asia, pero está dentro de la clasificación como parte del grupo de Europa y América del Norte, así como la isla de Pascua geográficamente ubicada en Oceanía, pero que forma parte de la región América Latina y el Caribe, ya que la isla es parte de Chile.\n\nLa siguiente lista muestra a aquellos países que presentan 10 o más Patrimonios de la Humanidad, hasta septiembre de 2023. Estos 32 países representan más de la mitad de los sitios nombrados.\n\nDe entre todos los sitios existentes, algunos se sitúan además en la lista de Patrimonios de la Humanidad en peligro, al estar amenazados por conflictos, catástrofes naturales, o el deterioro del medio ambiente por el ser humano. 53 sitios se encuentran en la categoría \"Patrimonio de la Humanidad en peligro\" (17 naturales y 36 culturales), siendo los países con mayor cantidad de estos Siria (6 sitios en peligro), Libia (5 sitios), República Democrática del Congo (5 sitios), Irak (3 sitios), Malí (3 sitios), Palestina (3 sitios) y Yemen (3 sitios).\n\nSolo tres Patrimonios de la Humanidad han sido retirados de las listas por considerarse que habían sido desprotegidos por los países donde se encontraban.\n\nLa distinción de Patrimonio de la Humanidad ha recibido críticas desde distintas perspectivas. Una de ellas es el impacto adverso del turismo de masas en sitios que no pueden gestionar el rápido crecimiento del número de visitantes.[16]​\n• Portal:Patrimonio de la Humanidad.

UU.; en inglés: United States o US),[nota 3]​ denominado oficialmente Estados Unidos de América (EUA; en inglés: United States of America o USA)[13]​ es un país soberano constituido en una república federal constitucional compuesta por cincuenta estados y un distrito federal. Limita al norte con Canadá y al sur, con México. Su capital es Washington D. C. y su ciudad más poblada, Nueva York. La mayor parte del país se ubica en el medio de América del Norte ―donde se encuentran sus 48 estados contiguos y Washington D. C.―, entre los océanos Pacífico y Atlántico.\n\nEl estado de Alaska está en el noroeste del continente, limita con Canadá al este, separado de Rusia al oeste por el estrecho de Bering. El estado de Hawái es un archipiélago polinesio ubicado en Oceanía, en medio del océano Pacífico y es el único de sus estados que no se encuentra en América.\n\nEl país posee en el mar Caribe dos territorios no incorporados, el estado libre asociado de Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes, en el Pacífico otros territorios no incorporados, y a diferencia de estos últimos, un «territorio incorporado no organizado»: el atolón Palmyra.\n\nCon 9.83 millones de kilómetros cuadrados,[5]​ y con más de 340 millones de habitantes, el país está en el cuarto puesto por superficie total, en el quinto por superficie contigua y en el tercer por población. Es una de las naciones con más diversidad de etnias y culturas, producto de la inmigración a gran escala.[14]​\n\nEs la economía nacional más grande del mundo en términos nominales, con un PIB estimado en 22.6 billones de dólares (una cuarta parte del PIB global nominal) y una quinta parte del PIB global en paridad de poder adquisitivo.[9]​ El país es la principal fuerza capitalista del planeta, además de ser líder en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX y, desde comienzos del siglo XX, el principal país industrial. En PIB PPA, Estados Unidos es la segunda economía más grande, por detrás de la China.[15]​\n\nEl territorio continental estadounidense estuvo habitado por diversos grupos indígenas durante miles de años. Esta población aborigen fue reducida por las enfermedades y la guerra, después del primer contacto con los europeos. Estados Unidos fue fundado por trece colonias británicas, a lo largo de la costa atlántica. El 4 de julio de 1776, emitieron la Declaración de Independencia, que proclamó su derecho a la libre autodeterminación y el establecimiento de una unión cooperativa. Los estados rebeldes derrotaron al Imperio británico en la guerra de independencia, el primer conflicto bélico colonial exitoso de carácter independentista. ​ La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue adoptada el 17 de septiembre de 1787; su ratificación al año siguiente hizo a los estados parte de una sola república con un gobierno central fuerte. La Carta de Derechos, que comprende diez enmiendas constitucionales que garantizan muchos derechos civiles fundamentales y las libertades, fue ratificada en 1791.\n\nEn el siglo XIX, los Estados Unidos adquirieron territorios de Francia, España, Reino Unido, México, Rusia y Japón, además de anexionarse las repúblicas de Florida, Texas, California y Hawái. En la década de 1860, las disputas entre el sur agrario y conservador y el norte industrial y progresista sobre los derechos de los estados y la abolición de la esclavitud provocaron la Guerra de Secesión. La victoria del norte evitó una división permanente del país y condujo al final de la esclavitud legal. Para la década de 1890, la economía nacional era la más grande del mundo[17]​ y la guerra hispano-estadounidense y la Primera Guerra Mundial confirmaron su estatus como una potencia militar. Después de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, surgió como el primer país con armas nucleares y miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nDurante la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos luchó en la guerra de Corea y la guerra de Vietnam, pero evitó el conflicto militar directo con la Unión Soviética. Las dos superpotencias compitieron en la Carrera Espacial, que culminó en el vuelo espacial de 1969 que llevó a los humanos a la Luna por primera vez. El final de la Guerra Fría y la disolución de la URSS la dejaron como la única superpotencia internacional. En el siglo XXI, los atentados del 11-S dieron lugar a la denominada guerra contra el terrorismo, y el ascenso de China y el regreso de Rusia conducen a una Nueva Guerra Fría, mientras que eventos como la crisis económica de 2008, la elección de Donald Trump como presidente en 2016 o las protestas por la muerte de George Floyd en 2020 provocaron tensiones sociales internas.\n\nEl país representa dos quintas partes del gasto militar mundial y es una fuerza económica, política y cultural, líder en el mundo.[18]​[19]​\n\nEn 1507, el cartógrafo alemán Martin Waldseemüller elaboró un planisferio en el que llamó a las tierras del hemisferio occidental «América», en honor al explorador y cartógrafo italiano Américo Vespucio.[20]​ Las antiguas colonias británicas utilizaron por primera vez el nombre del país moderno en la Declaración de Independencia, la «unánime declaración de los trece Estados Unidos de la América» adoptada por los «representantes de los Estados Unidos de América», 4 de julio de 1776.[21]​ El nombre actual se determinó el 15 de noviembre de 1777, cuando el Segundo Congreso Continental aprobó los Artículos de la Confederación, que estipulan, «El nombre de esta Confederación será “Los Estados Unidos de América”». «Columbia», un nombre una vez popular para los Estados Unidos, se deriva del nombre de Cristóbal Colón y aún permanece en el nombre del distrito de Columbia. Ocasionalmente se le llama, de forma incorrecta, «Estados Unidos de Norteamérica», derivando en una confusión en su gentilicio.\n\nLa manera estándar para referirse a un ciudadano de los Estados Unidos son los términos estadounidense (o estadunidense en Honduras y México).[13]​ También se utilizan gringo y yanqui, que pueden o no tener un matiz despectivo, según el uso, el contexto y el tono de la voz.[22]​ A veces se utiliza «norteamericano» como sinónimo de «estadounidense», pero se debe tener presente que la región de Norteamérica está formada por Canadá, Estados Unidos y la mayor parte de México, hasta el istmo de Tehuantepec. Debe evitarse el gentilicio «americano» para referirse exclusivamente a los naturales de los Estados Unidos[13]​ debido a que esta palabra engloba a todos los habitantes del continente americano. Por esta razón, el gentilicio recomendado es la palabra «estadounidense». Para escribir abreviadamente el nombre de este país suelen emplearse, de manera correcta, la abreviatura «EE. UU.» (Estados Unidos),[23]​ o la sigla «EUA» (Estados Unidos de América). Aunque frecuente, en español es incorrecto emplear la sigla anglosajona «USA».[13]​\n\nComúnmente se piensa que los pueblos indígenas de los Estados Unidos continentales, incluyendo a los nativos de Alaska, emigraron desde Asia entre doce mil y cuarenta mil años atrás.[24]​ Algunos, tales como la cultura misisipiana, desarrollaron una agricultura avanzada, grandes obras arquitectónicas y sociedades con un orden jerárquico. Después de que los europeos comenzaran a asentarse en América, hubo una acusada disminución de la población indígena debido a las epidemias de enfermedades traídas desde Europa, como la viruela.[25]​\n\nEn 1492, el navegante Cristóbal Colón, en su proyecto de circunnavegar hasta Asia, patrocinado por la Corona Española, llegó desde España hasta las islas del Caribe, realizando el primer contacto con los pueblos indígenas del Nuevo Mundo. El 2 de abril de 1513, el conquistador español Juan Ponce de León desembarcó en lo que llamó La Florida, siendo la primera llegada europea documentada en el territorio estadounidense. Los asentamientos españoles en la región fueron seguidos por otros en el actual suroeste de Estados Unidos. Los comerciantes de pieles franceses se establecieron en Nueva Francia, alrededor de la zona de los Grandes Lagos; finalmente Francia reclamaría gran parte del interior de Estados Unidos, hasta la costa del golfo de México. Los primeros asentamientos ingleses exitosos fueron la colonia de Virginia en Jamestown en 1607 y la colonia de Plymouth fundada por peregrinos en 1620. En 1628, el establecimiento de la provincia de la bahía de Massachusetts dio lugar a una nueva ola de inmigración: para 1634, Nueva Inglaterra estaba habitada por cerca de diez mil puritanos. Entre la década de 1610 y la guerra de independencia, cerca de cincuenta mil convictos fueron enviados desde el Viejo Continente hacia las colonias.[26]​ Desde 1614, los neerlandeses se establecieron a lo largo del río Hudson inferior, fundando Nueva Ámsterdam en la isla de Manhattan.\n\nEn 1674, los Países Bajos cedieron su territorio a Inglaterra y la provincia de los Nuevos Países Bajos fue renombrada con el nombre de Nueva York, convertida en la ciudad más importante de los Estados Unidos desde mediados del siglo XIX. Muchos inmigrantes recién llegados, especialmente en el sur, fueron contratados como criados, de tal modo que cerca de dos tercios de todos los inmigrantes que llegaron a Virginia entre 1630 y 1680 trabajaban como sirvientes. ​ Para finales de ese siglo, los esclavos africanos se convirtieron en la principal fuente de mano de obra en condiciones de servidumbre. Con la división de las Carolinas en 1729 y la colonización de Georgia en 1732, se establecieron las Trece Colonias británicas, que finalmente se convertirían en los Estados Unidos de América. Todas contaban con un gobierno local electo, apegado al republicanismo, además de que se legalizó el comercio de esclavos. Con altas tasas de nacimiento, bajas tasas de mortalidad y la constante inmigración, la población colonial creció rápidamente. El movimiento cristiano revivalista de las décadas de 1730 y 1740, conocido como «el Gran Despertar», alimentó el interés en temas como la religión y la libertad de culto. En la guerra franco-india, las fuerzas británicas le arrebataron Canadá a Francia, pero la población de habla francesa permaneció políticamente aislada de las colonias del sur. Sin contar a los nativos americanos (popularmente conocidos como «indios») que finalmente fueron desplazados en contra de su voluntad, en 1770 las Trece colonias tenían una población de 2.6 millones de habitantes, alrededor de una tercera parte de la del Reino Unido, aunque casi uno de cada cinco estadounidenses era un esclavo negro. ​ Sin embargo, los colonos estadounidenses no tenían ninguna representación en el Parlamento del Reino Unido.\n\nLas tensiones entre los colonos y los británicos durante las décadas de 1760 y 1770 condujeron a la Guerra de Independencia, que se extendió desde 1775 hasta 1781. El 14 de junio de 1775, el Congreso Continental, reunido en Filadelfia, estableció un Ejército Continental bajo el mando de George Washington. Proclamando que «todos los hombres nacen iguales» y dotados de «ciertos derechos inalienables», el Congreso aprobó la Declaración de Independencia, redactada en gran parte por Thomas Jefferson, el 4 de julio de 1776.[29]​ Anualmente, en esta fecha se celebra el Día de la Independencia de los Estados Unidos. Así, Estados Unidos se convirtió en la primera nación americana en declarar su independencia. En 1777, los artículos de la Confederación establecieron un débil gobierno confederal, que operó hasta 1789.\n\nDespués de la derrota británica por las fuerzas estadounidenses, asistidas por franceses y españoles, el Reino Unido reconoció su independencia y soberanía sobre el territorio al este del río Misisipi. Una convención constitucional fue organizada en 1787 por aquellos que deseaban establecer un gobierno nacional fuerte. La Constitución de los Estados Unidos fue ratificada en 1788 y un año más tarde, George Washington se convirtió en el primer presidente. La Carta de Derechos, que prohibía la restricción federal de los derechos humanos y garantizaba una serie de medidas para su protección jurídica, fue adoptada en 1791.[30]​\n\nCon la nueva autonomía, las actitudes hacia la esclavitud fueron cambiando; una cláusula en la Constitución protegió el comercio de esclavos hasta 1808. Los estados del norte abolieron la esclavitud entre 1780 y 1804, dejando a los estados esclavistas del sur como defensores de la «institución peculiar». El «Segundo Gran Despertar», que comenzó alrededor de 1800, convirtió a las Iglesias evangélicas en una de las principales fuerzas detrás de varios de los movimientos reformistas de la época, incluyendo el abolicionismo.[31]​\n\nEn 1803, la compra de la Luisiana a Francia durante el mandato del presidente Thomas Jefferson, casi duplicó el tamaño de la nación,[32]​ al mismo tiempo que la guerra anglo-estadounidense de 1812 fortaleció aún más el nacionalismo entre la población. Derrotado por el Reino Unido y tras su segunda y definitiva abdicación al trono francés en 1815, Napoleón Bonaparte intentó escapar a Estados Unidos, entonces rival del Reino Unido, pero fue capturado por las fuerzas británicas y deportado a Santa Helena. En 1819, una serie de incursiones militares en Florida obligó a España a ceder este y otros territorios de la costa del golfo.[32]​ El sendero de lágrimas en la década de 1830 ejemplifica la política de Remoción India que despojó a varios pueblos indígenas de sus tierras. Estados Unidos se anexó la República de Texas en 1845, época durante la cual el concepto del Destino Manifiesto se popularizó. ​ En 1846, la firma del Tratado de Oregón con el Reino Unido, le otorgó al país los actuales territorios del noroeste.[32]​ Dos años más tarde, la victoria en la guerra contra México dio lugar a la cesión de California y la mayor parte del suroeste actual.[32]​ La fiebre del oro de 1848 y 1849 estimuló aún más la migración hacia el oeste y los nuevos ferrocarriles facilitaron la reubicación de los colonos y el aumento de los conflictos con los nativos americanos. Durante medio siglo, hasta 40 millones de bisontes americanos fueron sacrificados por sus pieles y carne para facilitar la propagación de los ferrocarriles. La pérdida de los búfalos, una fuente principal de alimento para los indígenas de las llanuras, fue un golpe mortal para muchas culturas nativas.[34]​\n\nLas tensiones entre estados pro-esclavistas y los abolicionistas, junto al aumento de los desacuerdos en la relación entre el gobierno federal y estatal, provocaron conflictos violentos por causa de la expansión de la esclavitud hacia los nuevos territorios. Abraham Lincoln, candidato del Partido Republicano y un gran abolicionista, fue elegido presidente en 1860. Antes de que tomase posesión de su cargo, seis estados esclavistas declararon su secesión de la Unión, formando los Estados Confederados de América, si bien otros estados también esclavistas permanecieron leales a la Unión.[35]​ El gobierno federal declaró que la secesión era ilegal y pronto se produjo el ataque por parte de los secesionistas a Fort Sumter, iniciándose así la guerra civil estadounidense el 12 de abril de 1861.[36]​\n\nTras la victoria de la Unión el 9 de abril de 1865, se añadieron tres enmiendas a la constitución para garantizar la libertad de los casi 4 millones de afroamericanos que habían sido esclavos, convirtiéndolos en ciudadanos y dándoles el derecho de voto.[37]​ La guerra y su resolución dio lugar a un aumento sustancial de las competencias del gobierno federal. ​\n\nDespués del asesinato de Abraham Lincoln, tuvo lugar la época conocida como la Reconstrucción, en la cual se desarrollaron políticas encaminadas a la reintegración y la reconstrucción de los estados sureños garantizando al mismo tiempo los derechos de los nuevos esclavos liberados. Las controvertidas elecciones presidenciales de 1876 se resolvieron mediante el Compromiso de 1877, por el cual los demócratas sureños reconocieron como presidente a Rutherford B. Hayes a cambio de que este retirara las tropas que aún permanecían desplegadas en Luisiana, Carolina del Sur y Florida. A partir de 1876 empiezan a aplicarse las llamadas leyes de Jim Crow, una política de apartheid que perduraría hasta 1965.[39]​ La Masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último conflicto armado en la larga guerra con los pueblos originarios.[40]​\n\nEn el norte, la urbanización sin precedentes y una afluencia de inmigrantes aceleró la industrialización del país. La ola de la inmigración, que duró hasta 1929, proporcionó mano de obra para los negocios, transformado a su vez la cultura. La alta protección arancelaria, la creación de infraestructuras nacionales y los nuevos reglamentos bancarios alentaron el crecimiento industrial. En 1867, se produce la compra de Alaska a Rusia, completando la expansión continental del país.[32]​ La masacre de Wounded Knee en 1890 fue el último gran conflicto armado contra los nativos indios americanos. En 1893, la monarquía indígena del Reino de Hawái fue derrocada en un golpe de Estado liderado por ciudadanos estadounidenses; el archipiélago fue anexado al país en 1898.[32]​ La victoria en la guerra hispano-estadounidense ese mismo año, demostró que Estados Unidos era una potencia mundial y dio lugar a la ocupación de Cuba y la anexión de Puerto Rico y las Filipinas.[41]​ Filipinas accedió a la independencia en 1946, mientras que Puerto Rico continúa siendo un Estado libre asociado.\n\nAl estallar la Primera Guerra Mundial en Europa en 1914, Estados Unidos se declaró neutral. Posteriormente, los estadounidenses se solidarizaron con los británicos y franceses, a pesar de que muchos ciudadanos, sobre todo los originarios de Irlanda y Alemania, se opusieron a la intervención. ​ En 1917 se sumaron a los Aliados, contribuyendo a la derrota de las Potencias Centrales. Reacio a participar en asuntos europeos, el Senado no ratificó el Tratado de Versalles (1919), que estableció la Sociedad de Naciones, aplicando una política de unilateralismo, que rayaba en el aislacionismo. ​ En 1920, el movimiento de los derechos de la mujer ganó la aprobación de una enmienda constitucional para otorgar a las mujeres el sufragio.[30]​\n\nDurante la mayor parte de la década de 1920, el país gozó de un período de prosperidad, disminuyendo el desequilibrio de la balanza de pagos mientras crecían las ganancias de las granjas industriales. Este período, conocido como los felices años veinte, culminó en la crisis de 1929 que desencadenó la Gran Depresión. Después de su elección como presidente en 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt respondió con el New Deal (nuevo trato), una serie de políticas que aumentaron la intervención del gobierno en la economía.[44]​ De 1920 a 1933 se estableció una ley seca conocida como La prohibición.[45]​ La Dust Bowl (cuenca de polvo) de mediados de la década de 1930 dejó varias comunidades de agricultores empobrecidos y estimuló una nueva ola de migración hacia la costa occidental.[46]​\n\nEstados Unidos, oficialmente neutral durante las primeras etapas de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, inició el suministro de provisiones a los Aliados en marzo de 1941, a través del Programa de Préstamo y Arriendo. El 7 de diciembre de 1941, el país se unió a la lucha de los Aliados contra las Potencias del Eje, después del ataque japonés a Pearl Harbor. La Segunda Guerra Mundial impulsó la economía mediante el suministro de capital de inversión y puestos de trabajo, haciendo que muchas mujeres entraran en el mercado laboral. De los principales combatientes, Estados Unidos fue la única nación que se enriqueció a causa de la guerra. ​ Las conferencias en Bretton Woods y Yalta crearon un nuevo sistema de organización internacional que colocó al país y a la Unión Soviética en el centro de los asuntos mundiales. En 1945, cuando llegó el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial en Europa, una conferencia internacional celebrada en San Francisco redactó la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, que entró en vigor después de la guerra.[48]​ Después de haber desarrollado la primera arma nuclear, el gobierno decidió utilizarla en las ciudades japonesas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki en agosto de ese mismo año. Japón se rindió el 2 de septiembre, poniendo fin a la guerra.[49]​\n\nEn la Guerra Fría, Estados Unidos y la Unión Soviética compitieron tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial, dominando los asuntos militares de Europa a través de la OTAN y del Pacto de Varsovia. El primero promovió la democracia liberal y el capitalismo, mientras que el segundo extendía el comunismo y una economía planificada por el gobierno. Ambos apoyaron varias dictaduras y participaron en guerras subsidiarias. Entre 1950 y 1953, las tropas estadounidenses combatieron a las fuerzas comunistas chinas en la guerra de Corea.[50]​ Desde la ruptura con la URSS y el inicio de la Guerra Fría y hasta 1957, dentro de Estados Unidos se desarrolló el macarthismo, también llamado Segundo Temor rojo, en el que el Estado desató una ola de represión política y una campaña de miedo contra aquellas personas comunistas o simplemente sospechosas de serlo, que algunos autores señalan como propio de un Estado totalitario. Cientos de personas fueron detenidas, incluidas decenas de celebridades, y entre diez mil y doce mil personas perdieron sus puestos de trabajo.[51]​ La persecución finalizó cuando los tribunales la declararon inconstitucional.[52]​\n\nEn 1961, el lanzamiento soviético de la primera nave espacial tripulada provocó que el presidente John F. Kennedy propusiera al país ser los primeros en enviar «un hombre a la Luna», hecho logrado en 1969.[53]​ Kennedy también enfrentó un tenso conflicto nuclear con las fuerzas soviéticas en Cuba, al tiempo que la economía crecía y se expandía de manera constante. Un creciente movimiento por los derechos civiles, representado y liderado por afroamericanos como Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King y James Bevel, utilizó la no violencia para hacer frente a la segregación y la discriminación.[54]​ Después del asesinato de Kennedy en 1963, la Ley de Derechos Civiles de 1964 y la Ley de Derechos Electorales de 1965 se aprobaron durante el mandato del presidente Lyndon B. Johnson. Johnson y su sucesor, Richard Nixon, llevaron una guerra civil subsidiaria en el sudeste asiático a la infructuosa guerra de Vietnam.[50]​ Un movimiento contracultural generalizado creció, impulsado por la oposición a la guerra, el nacionalismo negro y la revolución sexual. También surgió una nueva ola de movimientos feministas, liderados por Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem y otras mujeres que buscaban la equidad política, social y económica.\n\nEn 1974, como resultado del escándalo Watergate, Nixon se convirtió en el primer presidente en renunciar, para evitar ser destituido por cargos como obstrucción a la justicia y abuso de poder; fue sucedido por el vicepresidente Gerald Ford.[55]​ La administración de Jimmy Carter en la segunda mitad de la década de 1970 (1977-1981) estuvo marcada por la estanflación y la crisis de los rehenes en Irán. La elección de Ronald Reagan como presidente en 1980 anunció un cambio en la política estadounidense, que se reflejó en reformas importantes en los impuestos y gastos fiscales. Su segundo mandato trajo consigo el escándalo Irán-Contra y el significativo progreso diplomático con la Unión Soviética. El posterior colapso soviético terminó la Guerra Fría.\n\nBajo el mandato del presidente George H. W. Bush, el país tomó un papel de liderazgo hegemónico mundial, como en la guerra del Golfo (1991). La expansión económica más larga en la historia moderna de Estados Unidos, desde marzo de 1991 hasta marzo de 2001, abarcó la administración de Bill Clinton y la burbuja punto com.[56]​ Una demanda civil y un escándalo sexual llevó al impeachment de Clinton en 1998, aunque logró terminar su periodo. Las elecciones presidenciales de 2000, de las más competidas en la historia estadounidense, fueron resueltas por una decisión de la Corte Suprema. George W. Bush, hijo de George H. W. Bush, fue proclamado presidente a pesar de que obtuvo menos votos que su rival, Al Gore.[57]​ Esta situación, que ha ocurrido tres veces en la historia, se debe al sistema de voto estadounidense (colegiado).\n\nEl 11 de septiembre de 2001, los terroristas del grupo Al-Qaeda atacaron las Torres Gemelas del World Trade Center de la ciudad de Nueva York (que fueron destruidas) y El Pentágono cerca de Washington D. C., en una serie de atentados que acabó con la vida de casi tres mil personas. En respuesta, la administración de Bush lanzó la «guerra contra el terrorismo». A finales de 2001, las fuerzas estadounidenses invadieron Afganistán, derrocaron al gobierno talibán y destruyeron los campos de entrenamiento de Al-Qaeda. Los insurgentes talibanes continúan luchando una guerra de guerrillas. En 2002 Bush comenzó a presionar para que se llevara a cabo un cambio de régimen en Irak.[58]​[59]​ Con la falta de apoyo de la OTAN y sin un mandato explícito de la ONU para una intervención militar, Bush organizó la coalición de la voluntad; las fuerzas de la coalición rápidamente invadieron Irak en 2003 y derrocaron al dictador Saddam Hussein. Al año siguiente, Bush fue reelegido como el presidente más votado en unas elecciones.\n\nEn 2005, el huracán Katrina, que terminaría siendo el desastre natural más mortífero en la historia nacional, causó una destrucción severa a lo largo de la costa del Golfo: la ciudad de Nueva Orleans quedó devastada,[60]​ con 1833 muertos.\n\nEl 4 de noviembre de 2008, en medio de una recesión económica mundial, Barack Obama fue elegido presidente, habiendo sido el primer afroamericano en ocupar el cargo. En mayo de 2011, las fuerzas especiales estadounidenses lograron matar a Osama bin Laden, escondido en Pakistán. Al año siguiente, Barack Obama fue reelegido. Bajo su segundo mandato impartió la guerra contra el Estado Islámico y se restablecieron las relaciones diplomáticas con Cuba.\n\nEl 8 de noviembre de 2016, el magnate Donald Trump por el Partido Republicano venció a la ex primera dama Hillary Clinton para la presidencia en unas elecciones insólitas[61]​ y cuyos planes han sido descritos por analistas políticos como populistas, proteccionistas y nacionalistas, jurando el cargo el 20 de enero de 2017.\n\nLas masacres en Orlando del 12 de junio de 2016 en la discoteca gay Pulse (51 muertos)[62]​ y en Las Vegas el 1 de octubre de 2017 (60) figuran como las mayores matanzas del país desde los atentados del 11-S.\n\nEl 7 de noviembre de 2020, Joe Biden gana las elecciones presidenciales, venciendo a Donald Trump quien no consiguió la reelección presidencial. Es la segunda vez que un presidente estadounidense no alcanza la reelección después de George H. W. Bush. Biden juró al cargo el 20 de enero de 2021. El 6 de enero de 2021, los partidarios del presidente saliente Trump irrumpieron en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos en un esfuerzo infructuoso por interrumpir el recuento de votos del Colegio Electoral presidencial.[63]​\n\nEstados Unidos es la federación más antigua del mundo. Es una república constitucional, democrática y representativa, «en la que el mandato de la mayoría es regulado por los derechos de las minorías, protegidos por la ley». ​ El gobierno está regulado por un sistema de controles y equilibrios, definidos por la Constitución, que sirve como el documento legal supremo del país.[65]​ En el sistema federalista estadounidense, los ciudadanos están generalmente sujetos a tres niveles de gobierno: federal, estatal y local; los deberes del gobierno local comúnmente se dividen entre los gobiernos de los condados y municipios. En casi todos los casos, los funcionarios del poder ejecutivo y legislativo son elegidos por sufragio directo de los ciudadanos del distrito.\n\nEl gobierno federal se divide en tres ramas de poder:[65]​\n• Poder legislativo: El Congreso bicameral, compuesto por el Senado y la Cámara de Representantes. Su función es crear las leyes federales, hacer declaraciones de guerra, aprobar los tratados, administran los fondos públicos y tiene el poder del impeachment, por medio del cual pueden destituir a funcionarios del gobierno.\n• Poder ejecutivo: El presidente es el comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas, puede vetar los proyectos de ley antes de que se conviertan en leyes oficiales y nombra a los miembros del gabinete (sujeto a la aprobación del Senado) y otros oficiales, que administran y hacer cumplir las leyes federales y políticas.\n• Poder judicial: La Corte Suprema y los tribunales federales inferiores, cuyos jueces son nombrados por el presidente con la aprobación del Senado, interpretan las leyes y suprimen las que se consideren anticonstitucionales.\n\nLa Cámara de Representantes tiene 435 miembros electos, cada uno representando a un distrito del Congreso para un mandato de dos años.[65]​ Los lugares dentro de la cámara se distribuyen entre los estados según su población cada diez años. Según el censo de 2000, siete estados tienen el mínimo de un representante, mientras que California, el estado más poblado, tiene cincuenta y tres. El Senado tiene cien miembros, ya que cada estado cuenta con dos senadores, elegidos para un término de seis años; un tercio de los escaños en el Senado son electos cada dos años.[65]​ La Corte Suprema, liderada por el jefe de justicia, tiene nueve miembros, que sirven de manera permanente.[65]​\n\nEl presidente cumple mandato por un término de cuatro años y podrá ser reelegido para el cargo no más de una vez. El presidente no es elegido por sufragio directo, sino por un sistema indirecto de colegios electorales, en el que los votos determinantes son prorrateados por estado.[65]​ Un estado solo puede brindar determinada cantidad de votos según el número de congresistas que tenga dentro del poder legislativo: senadores (dos por cada estado) y representantes (que varía según la población de cada estado); dando un total de 538 miembros. El sistema bipartidista del país permite que un candidato a la presidencia, ya sea republicano o demócrata, solo necesite 270 votos para asegurar la victoria.[66]​\n\nLos gobiernos de los cincuenta estados están estructurados de manera más o menos similar, aunque Nebraska es el único que tiene una legislatura unicameral.[67]​ El gobernador (jefe ejecutivo) de cada estado es elegido por sufragio directo. Algunos jueces de estado y funcionarios de gabinete son designados por los gobernadores de los respectivos estados, mientras que otros son elegidos por voto popular.\n\nTodas las leyes y los procedimientos gubernamentales están sujetas a revisión judicial, y se anula cualquier ley que esté en contra de la Constitución. El texto original de la Constitución establece la estructura y responsabilidades del gobierno federal y su relación con los gobiernos estados.[65]​ El Artículo I protege el derecho al «gran recurso» de habeas corpus[30]​ y el Artículo III garantiza el derecho a un juicio con jurado en todos los casos penales.[30]​ Las enmiendas a la Constitución requieren la aprobación de tres cuartas partes de los estados. La Constitución ha sido enmendada veintisiete veces; las primeras diez enmiendas, que componen la Carta de Derechos y la decimocuarta enmienda forman la base central de las garantías individuales.[30]​\n\nEstados Unidos ejerce una influencia económica, política y militar a nivel mundial. Es un miembro permanente del Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas, además de que la Sede de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas se encuentra en la ciudad de Nueva York. También es miembro del G8, el G-20 y la Organización para la Cooperación y el Desarrollo Económico. La inmensa mayoría de los países tienen una embajada o un consulado en Washington D. C. u otra ciudad importante del país. A su vez, casi todos los países del mundo cuentan con una misión diplomática estadounidense.[68]​ Sin embargo, Corea del Norte, Bután, Sudán y la República de China (Taiwán) no tienen relaciones diplomáticas formales con la nación.\n\nTambién goza de fuertes lazos con el Reino Unido, Canadá, Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Japón, Corea del Sur e Israel. Trabaja en estrecha colaboración con sus colegas de la Organización del Tratado del Atlántico Norte sobre cuestiones militares y de seguridad, y con sus vecinos a través de la Organización de los Estados Americanos y de tratados internacionales como el acuerdo trilateral del Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte con Canadá y México. En 2012, Estados Unidos gastó un neto de 30 460 millones de dólares en ayuda oficial al desarrollo, la mayor cantidad en el mundo, aunque en términos de porcentaje del producto interior bruto (PIB), su contribución de 0.19 % ocupó uno de los últimos lugares entre las veintitrés naciones donantes. En contraste, las empresas privadas estadounidenses son relativamente más generosas.[69]​[70]​\n\nEl presidente ostenta el título de comandante en jefe de las fuerzas armadas de la nación y nombra a sus líderes: el Secretario de Defensa y la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor. El Departamento de Defensa administra las fuerzas armadas, incluyendo el Ejército, la Armada, el Cuerpo de Marines y la Fuerza Aérea. La Guardia Costera es administrada por el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional en tiempos de paz y por el Departamento de la Armada en tiempo de guerra. En 2008, las fuerzas armadas contaban con 1.4 millones de miembros activos. Las reservas y la Guardia Nacional elevan el número total de tropas a 2.3 millones. El Departamento de Defensa también emplea a aproximadamente setencientos mil civiles, sin incluir a los contratistas.[71]​\n\nEl servicio militar es voluntario, aunque en tiempos de guerra el Estado puede imponer el reclutamiento a través de un sistema de servicio selectivo, el llamado «Selective Service System».[72]​ Como la gran potencia militar del mundo, las fuerzas armadas de Estados Unidos poseen las más avanzadas máquinas de guerra. Cuenta con miles de aviones, cientos de embarcaciones, carros de combate, misiles intercontinentales (ICBM), miles de ojivas nucleares y tiene diez portaaviones activos en la Armada; además, posee fuerzas aeronavales de carácter permanente en las costas del océano Atlántico ―Fleet Forces Command―, Pacífico ―Flota del Pacífico― y el Golfo Pérsico ―Quinta Flota―.\n\nLa instalación progresiva de las fuerzas armadas estadounidenses a gran escala empezó con la división y ocupación de Alemania en 1945, se amplió con la guerra fría en sus países de influencia, y continúa vigente.\n\nEl ejército opera alrededor de 870 bases e instalaciones en el extranjero[73]​ y mantiene guarniciones de más de 100 militares activos en 28 países distintos.[74]​ El alcance de esta presencia militar global ha llevado a algunos autores a describir al país como si mantuviera un «imperio de bases».[75]​[76]​\n\nLos gastos militares en 2020, fueron de 740 500 millones de dólares,[77]​ aproximadamente el 37.5 % del gasto militar mundial[78]​ y más altos que los gastos juntos de los siguientes catorce países con los ejércitos más grandes. El gasto per cápita fue de 1967 dólares, alrededor de nueve veces el promedio mundial; ocupando el 4.4 % del PIB[79]​ y el 18 % del presupuesto federal.[80]​ El presupuesto base del Departamento de Defensa para 2010 ―fijado en 533 800 millones de dólares― aumentó un 4 % en 2009 y un 80 % más que en 2001; se destinarán 130 000 millones de dólares adicionales para las campañas militares en Irak y Afganistán.[81]​ En mayo de 2010 había 94 000 soldados estadounidenses desplegados en Afganistán y 92 000 en Irak.[82]​ Para junio de 2010, el ejército estadounidense había sufrido 4400 bajas durante la guerra en Irak[83]​ y 1087 durante la guerra en Afganistán.[84]​\n\nEstados Unidos cuenta, según las informaciones disponibles, con los mayores servicios de inteligencia del mundo, que se agrupan y coordinan alrededor de la llamada Comunidad de Inteligencia ―United States Intelligence Community (IC)―. Diecisiete agencias federales de inteligencia forman esta comunidad; estas agencias generalmente están subordinadas al Departamento de Defensa o al Departamento de Justicia, mientras que otras tienen la consideración de agencia independiente federal, por lo que solo deben rendir cuentas al Director Nacional de Inteligencia y al Presidente de los Estados Unidos. Las agencias de la comunidad ―tanto militares como civiles― se dedican a actividades de inteligencia relacionadas con asuntos exteriores y la seguridad nacional y cuentan con cientos de miles de empleados ―107 035 a mediados de 2013, último dato conocido―[85]​ y unos presupuestos confidenciales que solo en 2013 sumaron 52 600 millones de dólares.[85]​ Una de las agencias que la componen es la célebre Agencia Central de Inteligencia (CIA).[86]​\n\nEn 2010, según informaciones de The Washington Post, 1271 organizaciones gubernamentales, 1931 empresas privadas y 854 000 personas con acceso a espacios e información de alto secreto se dedicaban en Estados Unidos a labores de contraterrorismo, inteligencia y seguridad nacional.[87]​\n\nEn materia de derechos humanos, respecto a la pertenencia a los siete organismos de la Carta Internacional de Derechos Humanos, que incluyen al Comité de Derechos Humanos (HRC), Estados Unidos de América ha firmado o ratificado:\n\nEstados Unidos es una unión federal de cincuenta estados. Los trece estados originales fueron los sucesores de las Trece Colonias que se rebelaron contra el Imperio británico. Poco después de la independencia, se crearon tres nuevos estados a partir de otros ya existentes: Kentucky de Virginia; Tennessee de Carolina del Norte y Maine de Massachusetts. La mayoría de los otros estados fueron creados a partir de territorios obtenidos a través de la guerra o la compra por parte del gobierno. Vermont, Texas y Hawái son la excepción: cada uno de ellos fue una república independiente antes de integrarse a la Unión. Durante la guerra de Secesión, Virginia Occidental se separó de Virginia. El estado más reciente es Hawái, que logró el reconocimiento como estado el 21 de agosto de 1959. Los estados no tienen el derecho de separarse de la Unión.\n\nLos estados componen gran parte del territorio estadounidense; las otras dos áreas que se consideran parte integrante del país son el Distrito de Columbia ―el distrito federal donde se encuentra la capital Washington D. C.― y el Atolón Palmyra, un territorio deshabitado pero incorporado, ubicado en el océano Pacífico. Estados Unidos también posee cinco grandes territorios de ultramar: Puerto Rico y las Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos en el Caribe y Samoa Americana, Guam y las Islas Marianas del Norte en el Pacífico. Aquellos que nacieron en esos territorios (excepto en la Samoa Americana) poseen la ciudadanía estadounidense. Los ciudadanos estadounidenses que residen en los territorios tienen muchos de los derechos y responsabilidades de los ciudadanos que residen en los estados; sin embargo, generalmente están exentos del pago de impuestos federales, no pueden votar en las elecciones presidenciales y solo tienen representación en calidad de observadores en el Congreso. ​\n\nLa superficie de los Estados Unidos continentales es de aproximadamente 7 700 000 km² (kilómetros cuadrados). Alaska, que está separada de los Estados Unidos continentales por Canadá, es el estado más grande del país, con 1 500 000 km². Hawái, ocupa un archipiélago ubicado en el Pacífico central, al suroeste de América del Norte, que abarca poco más de 16 000 km².[99]​ Después de Rusia y Canadá, es el tercer o cuarto país más grande del mundo por área total (tierra y agua), clasificado justo por encima o por debajo de China. La lista varía dependiendo de si se consideran los territorios en disputa entre China y la India y de cómo se calcula el tamaño total de los Estados Unidos: The World Factbook de la CIA considera 9 833 517 km²,[5]​ la División de Estadísticas de las Naciones Unidas calcula 9 629 091 km²,[100]​ y la Enciclopedia Británica estipula 9 522 055 km².[101]​ Incluyendo solo la superficie de la tierra, Estados Unidos es tercero en tamaño detrás de Rusia y Canadá, justo por delante de China.[102]​\n\nEl territorio nacional cuenta con múltiples formas de relieve y accidentes geográficos. A medida que se avanza tierra adentro, la llanura costera del litoral Atlántico da lugar al bosque caducifolio y a la meseta de Piedmont. Los Apalaches separan la costa oriental de los Grandes Lagos de las praderas del Medio Oeste. El río Misisipi-Misuri, el cuarto sistema fluvial más largo del mundo, corre de norte a sur a través del centro del país. La pradera llana y fértil de las Grandes Llanuras se extiende hacia el oeste, hasta que es interrumpida por una región de tierras altas en el sureste. Las Montañas Rocosas, en el borde occidental de las Grandes Llanuras, atraviesan de norte a sur todo el país, llegando a altitudes superiores a los 4300 m s. n. m. (metros sobre el nivel del mar) en Colorado. Más hacia el oeste se encuentra la Gran Cuenca y los desiertos, tales como el desierto de Mojave, de Sonora y de Chihuahua. Las montañas de la Sierra Nevada y la cordillera de las Cascadas se encuentran cerca de la costa del Pacífico. Con sus 6194 m s. n. m., el monte McKinley en Alaska es el punto más alto del país. Los volcanes activos son comunes a lo largo de Alaska y las islas Aleutianas, además de que Hawái consta de solo islas volcánicas. El supervolcán ubicado debajo del parque nacional Yellowstone en las montañas Rocosas, es la forma volcánica más grande del continente.[103]​\n\nPor su gran tamaño y variedad geográfica, el país cuenta con la mayoría de los tipos de clima. Al este del meridiano 100, el clima varía de continental húmedo en el norte a húmedo subtropical en el sur. El extremo sur de la Florida y las islas de Hawái tienen un clima tropical. Las Grandes Llanuras al oeste del meridiano 100 son semiáridas, mientras que gran parte de las montañas occidentales poseen un clima alpino. El clima es árido en la Gran Cuenca y en los desiertos del suroeste, es mediterráneo en la costa de California y oceánico en la costa sur de Alaska, Oregón y Washington. La mayor parte del territorio alaskeño tiene un clima subártico o polar. Los fenómenos meteorológicos extremos no son raros; los estados ribereños del golfo de México son propensos a huracanes y la mayoría de los tornados del mundo se desarrollan dentro del país, principalmente en la zona de Tornado Alley, en el Medio Oeste.[104]​\n\nEstados Unidos es considerado un país megadiverso: unas 17 000 especies de plantas vasculares viven en los Estados Unidos contiguos y Alaska y más de 1800 especies de plantas con flores se pueden encontrar tan solo en Hawái, pocas de las cuales crecen en el continente.[105]​ El país es el hábitat de más de 400 especies de mamíferos, 750 especies de aves y 500 especies de reptiles y anfibios.[106]​ Aquí también se han descubierto más de 91 000 diferentes clases de insectos.[107]​\n\nLa Ley de Especies en Peligro aprobada en 1973 protege a las especies amenazadas y en peligro de extinción y sus hábitats, que son supervisados por el Servicio de Pesca y Vida Silvestre de los Estados Unidos. En total, el gobierno federal posee el 28.8 % de la superficie total del país.[108]​ La mayor parte de este porcentaje está conformado por los cincuenta y ocho parques nacionales y cientos de otras áreas naturales protegidas administradas por las autoridades federales y estatales.[109]​ Del resto de las tierras del gobierno, algunas son alquiladas para la extracción de petróleo y gas natural, para la minería, agricultura o ganadería; solo el 2.4 % se utiliza para fines militares.[108]​\n\nLa economía de los Estados Unidos es una economía mixta capitalista, que se caracteriza por los abundantes recursos naturales, una infraestructura desarrollada y una alta productividad. ​ De acuerdo al Fondo Monetario Internacional, su PIB de 15.7 billones USD constituye el 24 % del Producto Mundial Bruto y cerca del 21 % del mismo en términos de paridad de poder adquisitivo (PPA).[9]​ Este es el PIB más grande en el mundo, aunque en 2008 era un 5 % menor que el PIB (PPA) de la Unión Europea. El país tiene el undécimo PIB per cápita nominal y el sexto PIB (PPA) per cápita más altos del mundo.[9]​ Además, el país está en segundo lugar del Índice de Competitividad Global de 2010.[111]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el importador de bienes más grande a nivel internacional y el tercero en términos de exportaciones, aunque las exportaciones per cápita son relativamente bajas para ser un país desarrollado. En 2008, el total de la balanza comercial estadounidense era de 696 000 millones de dólares.[112]​ En 2009, los automóviles constituyeron los principales productos exportados e importados.[113]​ Canadá, China, México, Alemania y Japón son sus principales socios comerciales.[114]​ Ese último es el que tiene la mayor deuda pública con Estados Unidos, ya que a principios de 2010 superó la deuda de China con 34 200 millones de dólares.[115]​\n\nEn 2010, el sector privado constituía un estimado del 55.3 % de la economía de Estados Unidos, las actividades del gobierno federal sumaban el 24.1 % y la actividad de los gobiernos estatales y locales ocupaban el restante 20.6 %.[118]​ Pese a que la economía estadounidense es posindustrial, ya que el sector servicios contribuye con el 67.8 % del PIB, la nación continúa siendo una potencia industrial.[119]​ En el campo de negocios, la actividad líder por sus ingresos es el comercio al por mayor y al por menor; por ingresos netos es la industria,[120]​ siendo la industria química la más importante.[121]​ Estados Unidos es el tercer productor de petróleo más importante en el mundo, así como el mayor importador de este producto.[122]​[123]​[124]​ También es el productor número uno de energía eléctrica y de energía nuclear, así como gas natural licuado, azufre, fosfatos y sal. Mientras que la agricultura representa menos del 1 % del PIB,[119]​ el país es el mayor productor de maíz[125]​ y soya.[126]​ Toda esta producción contribuye a que la bolsa de Nueva York sea la más grande del mundo.[127]​ A su vez, las empresas estadounidenses de Coca-Cola, McDonalds y Microsoft son las marcas más reconocidas en el mundo.[128]​\n\nEn el tercer trimestre de 2009, la fuerza de trabajo estadounidense era de 154.4 millones de personas. De estos empleados, un 81 % poseía un empleo en el sector de los servicios. Con 22.4 millones de personas, el gobierno es el principal campo de empleo.[129]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los trabajadores están sindicalizados, en comparación con el 30 % de Europa occidental.[130]​ El Banco Mundial clasifica a los Estados Unidos en primer lugar en la facilidad de contratación y liquidación de los trabajadores.[131]​ Entre 1973 y 2003, el año laboral para un estadounidense promedio creció 199 horas.[132]​ En parte como consecuencia, el país sostiene la máxima productividad de mano de obra en el mundo. En 2008, también llegó al primer puesto en productividad por hora, superando a Noruega, Francia, Bélgica y Luxemburgo, que habían superado a los Estados Unidos la mayor parte de la década anterior.[133]​ Comparado con Europa, los impuestos corporativos y de propiedad son más altos, mientras que los impuestos al consumidor son más bajos.[134]​\n\nAl ser un país desarrollado, Estados Unidos cuenta con una infraestructura de transportes avanzada: 6 465 799 km (kilómetros) de carreteras, 226 427 km de vías férreas, 15 095 aeropuertos y 41 009 km de vías fluviales.[136]​ La mayor parte de sus habitantes utilizan el automóvil como su principal medio de transporte. En 2003, había 759 automóviles por cada 1000 personas, en comparación con los 472 por cada 1000 habitantes de la Unión Europea.[137]​ Más del 40 % de los vehículos personales son camionetas, todoterrenos o camiones ligeros.[138]​ El adulto estadounidense promedio (incluyendo a conductores y no conductores) pasa diariamente 55 minutos en un automóvil, viajando una distancia de 47 km.[139]​\n\nLa industria aérea civil es propiedad privada, mientras que la mayoría de aeropuertos son de propiedad pública. Las tres aerolíneas más grandes en el mundo son de capital estadounidense: Southwest Airlines, American Airlines y Delta Air Lines.[140]​ De los treinta aeropuertos con mayor tránsito de pasajeros en el mundo, dieciséis están en el país, siendo el más concurrido de todos el Aeropuerto Internacional Hartsfield-Jackson en Atlanta.[141]​ Mientras que el transporte de mercancías por ferrocarril es muy importante, relativamente pocas personas utilizan este medio de transporte para viajar, dentro o entre las zonas urbanas.[142]​ Solamente el 9 % de las personas utilizan el transporte público para acudir al trabajo, un nivel muy bajo comparado con el 38.8 % de Europa.[143]​ También el uso de la bicicleta es mínimo, muy por debajo de los niveles europeos.[144]​\n\nEl consumo energético total del país es de 3873 billones kWh anuales, lo que equivale a un consumo per cápita de 7.8 toneladas de petróleo al año.[136]​ En 2005, un 40 % de esta energía provenía del petróleo, 23 % del carbón y 22 % del gas natural; el resto provenía de centrales nucleares y fuentes de energía renovable.[145]​ Estados Unidos es el mayor consumidor de petróleo y de gas natural: anualmente utiliza 19.5 millones de barriles de petróleo y 627 200 millones de metros cúbicos de gas natural.[123]​[146]​ Por otro lado, en el país se encuentran el 27 % de las reservas mundiales de carbón.[147]​ Por décadas, la energía nuclear ha jugado un papel limitado en la producción de energía, en comparación con la mayoría de los países desarrollados, debido en parte a la reacción pública después del accidente de Three Mile Island. Sin embargo, en 2007 el gobierno recibió múltiples peticiones para la construcción de nuevas centrales nucleares, lo que podría significar una disminución considerable en el consumo de combustibles fósiles[148]​ y un cambio en la política energética.\n\nEn el último censo decenal del país (2020), la cifra asciende a 331 449 281 de habitantes en abril de 2020 según la Oficina Nacional del Censo.[149]​ Esta cifra incluye un estimado de 11.2 millones de inmigrantes ilegales,[150]​ pero excluye la población de cinco territorios no incorporados (Puerto Rico, Islas Vírgenes de los Estados Unidos, Guam, Samoa americana e Islas Marianas del Norte). Esto la convierte en la tercera nación más poblada en el mundo, después de China y la India. Además, Estados Unidos es la única nación industrializada donde se prevé un aumento significativo en la población.[151]​ Con una tasa de natalidad de 13.82 bebés por cada 1000 habitantes (30 % por debajo de la media mundial), su tasa de crecimiento demográfico es de 0.98 %, significativamente más alto que los de Europa occidental, Japón y Corea del Sur.[152]​ En el año fiscal de 2009, 1.1 millones de inmigrantes obtuvieron la residencia legal.[153]​ México ha sido el principal país de origen de los nuevos residentes durante más de dos décadas; desde 1998, China, India y Filipinas también se han destacado en este sentido cada año.[154]​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene una población muy diversa: treinta y un diferentes grupos étnicos cuentan con más de un millón de representantes.[155]​ Los blancos estadounidenses son el grupo étnico más grande; los germano-estadounidenses, los hiberno-estadounidenses y los angloamericanos constituyen tres de los cuatro grupos étnicos más numerosos del país.[155]​ Los afroamericanos son la «minoría» racial más importante y el tercer grupo étnico más grande.[155]​[156]​ Los asiáticos son la segunda «minoría» racial con mayor presencia; dentro de este grupo destacan los grupos de origen chino y filipino.[155]​ En 2008, la población incluía un estimado de 6 millones de personas con ascendencia indígena, ya sea de un pueblo amerindio (1.8 millones), alaskeño (3.1 millones), hawaiano (500 000) o de una isla del Pacífico (600 000).[156]​\n\nEl crecimiento de la población de origen latinoamericano es una importante tendencia demográfica. De acuerdo a la Oficina Nacional del Censo, los 46.9 millones de descendientes de latinos o hispanos[156]​ son un grupo heterogéneo que comparten una distinta «etnicidad», así 64 % de los hispanos son de ascendencia mexicana.[157]​ Entre 2000 y 2008, la población hispana aumentó 32 %, mientras que la población no hispana aumentó solo un 4.3 %.[156]​ Gran parte de este crecimiento es debido a la inmigración, por ejemplo, en 2007 el 12.6 % de la población estadounidense había nacido en el extranjero, de los cuales, el 54 % nacieron en América Latina.[158]​ La tasa de fecundidad también es un factor: la mujer hispana promedio da a luz a tres niños, mientras que las mujeres negras tienen 2.2 y las mujeres blancas 1.8.[151]​ Las minorías (definidas por la Oficina del Censo como todos aquellos que no son hispanos o blancos) constituyen el 34 % de la población y se prevé que constituirán la mayoría para el 2042.[159]​\n\nAlrededor del 82 % de los estadounidenses viven en zonas urbanas (tal como las define la Oficina del Censo, estas áreas incluyen los suburbios);[136]​ cerca de la mitad residen en ciudades con una población superior a cincuenta mil habitantes.[160]​ En 2008, 273 localidades contaban con más de cien mil personas, nueve ciudades tenían más de un millón de residentes y cuatro ciudades globales tenían más de dos millones de residentes (Nueva York, Los Ángeles, Chicago y Houston).[161]​ Existen cincuenta y dos áreas metropolitanas con más de un millón de habitantes.[162]​ De las cincuenta áreas metropolitanas de más rápido crecimiento demográfico, cuarenta y siete se encuentran en el oeste y en el sur.[163]​ Las áreas metropolitanas de Dallas, Houston, Atlanta y Phoenix aumentaron su población en más de un millón de personas entre 2000 y 2008.[162]​\n\nLa educación pública estadounidense es operada por los gobiernos estatales y locales, regulados por el Departamento de Educación de los Estados Unidos. Es obligatorio que los niños asistan a la escuela desde los seis o siete años (por lo general, al jardín de niños o al primer grado de educación primaria) hasta que cumplen los dieciocho años (generalmente hasta cursar el duodécimo grado, el final de la escuela secundaria); algunos estados permiten a los estudiantes abandonar la escuela a los dieciséis o diecisiete años.[164]​ Aproximadamente el 12 % de los niños están inscritos en escuelas privadas, mientras que el 2 % recibe educación en el hogar.[165]​ Existen múltiples instituciones privadas y públicas de educación superior, así como de colleges comunitarios con las políticas de admisión abierta. De las personas mayores de veinticinco años, el 84.6 % se graduó de la escuela secundaria, un 52.6 % asistió a algún college, el 27.2 % obtuvo una licenciatura y el 9.6 % obtuvo un título de posgrado.[166]​ La tasa de alfabetización es de aproximadamente un 99 %.[136]​ La ONU le asigna al país un índice de educación de 0.97, el 12.º más alto en el mundo.[167]​ De acuerdo a la Unesco, Estados Unidos es el segundo país con más instituciones de educación superior en el mundo, con un total de 5758 y un promedio de más de 15 por cada estado.[168]​ El país también cuenta con el mayor número de estudiantes universitarios en el mundo, ascendiendo a 14 261 778, es decir, casi el 4.75 % de la población total.[169]​ Finalmente, aquí se encuentran algunas de las universidades más prestigiosas y de mayor fama en todo el mundo. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Stanford y el Instituto Tecnológico de Massachusetts son consideradas como las mejores universidades por varias publicaciones.[170]​[171]​[172]​\n\nEl inglés es el idioma nacional de facto. Aunque no existe ningún idioma oficial a nivel federal, algunas leyes ―como los Requisitos para la Naturalización― colocan al inglés como idioma obligatorio. En 2006, cerca de 241 millones, o sea, el 78 % de la población mayor de cinco años, hablaba únicamente el inglés en casa. El español, hablado por el 13 % de la población, es el segundo idioma más hablado, y el que más comúnmente se aprende como segunda lengua.[173]​[174]​ Algunas personas abogan por convertir el inglés en el idioma oficial, como lo es en al menos 28 estados.[175]​ El hawaiano y el inglés son los idiomas oficiales de Hawái,[176]​ mientras que el siux y el inglés son los de Dakota del Sur.[177]​\n\nAunque carecen de un idioma oficial, Nuevo México tiene leyes que alientan el uso del inglés y el español, de la misma forma que Luisiana lo hace con el inglés y el francés cajún. ​ En otros estados, como en California, la publicación de ciertos documentos oficiales en español es obligatoria.[179]​[180]​ Los territorios insulares garantizan el reconocimiento oficial de los idiomas nativos, junto con el inglés: el samoano y el chamorro son reconocidos por Samoa Americana y Guam, respectivamente; el carolinio y el chamorro son reconocidos por las Islas Marianas del Norte, y el español es un idioma oficial de Puerto Rico.\n\nAdemás de las lenguas mencionadas, se siguen hablando un número elevado de lenguas nativas en numerosas reservas por todo el país y pequeñas localidades. Cada una de estas lenguas cuenta con unos pocos de miles de hablantes, y la más importante demográficamente es el navajo, con casi doscientos mil hablantes nativos.\n\nEstados Unidos es oficialmente un Estado laico; la Primera Enmienda garantiza el libre ejercicio de la religión y prohíbe el establecimiento de cualquier gobierno religioso.[30]​ En un estudio de 2002, el 59 % de los estadounidenses aseguró que la religión desempeñaba un «papel muy importante en sus vidas», una cifra más elevada que la de cualquier otra nación desarrollada.[181]​ De acuerdo con una encuesta de 2007, un 78.4 % de los adultos se identificaron como cristianos,[182]​ registrándose una disminución desde 1990, cuando eran el 86.4 %.[183]​ Las denominaciones protestantes representaban el 51.3 %, mientras que la Iglesia católica con el 23.9 %, era la corriente religiosa más grande. El estudio clasifica a los evangélicos blancos, 26.3 % de la población, como la cohorte religiosa más grande del país;[182]​ otro estudio estima que los evangélicos de todas las razas conforman entre el 30 y 35 % de la población.[184]​ En 1990, el total de adeptos a religiones no cristianas eran el 3.3 %, para 2007 había crecido hasta un 4.7 %.[183]​ Las principales religiones no cristianas eran el judaísmo (1.7 %), el budismo (0.7 %), el islam (0.6 %), el hinduismo (0.4 %) y el unitarismo universalista (0.3 %).[182]​ La encuesta también informó que el 16.1 % de los estadounidenses se describían a sí mismos como agnósticos, ateos o simplemente sin ninguna religión.[182]​[183]​\n\nEn 2006, la esperanza de vida era de 77.8 años,[185]​ siendo un año más corta que el promedio de Europa occidental, y mucho más corta que la de países como Noruega, Suiza y Canadá.[186]​ Durante las últimas dos décadas, el nivel de esperanza de vida cayó del 11.º lugar mundial, hasta el 42.º.[187]​ La mortalidad infantil es de 6.37 fallecimientos por cada 1000 nacidos vivos.[188]​ Aproximadamente un tercio de la población adulta es obesa y otro tercio tiene sobrepeso;[189]​ el índice de obesidad, uno de los más altos del mundo, se ha duplicado en los últimos veinticinco años. ​ La alta incidencia de diabetes tipo 2 relacionada con la obesidad se considera una epidemia por algunos profesionales de la salud.[191]​ El índice de embarazos en la adolescencia asciende a 79.8 por cada 1000 mujeres, cuatro veces el índice de Francia y cinco veces el de Alemania.[192]​ El aborto, legal en algunos casos, es un tema muy controvertido: muchos estados prohibieron la financiación pública del procedimiento, restringieron el aborto cuando el feto ya está desarrollado, requieren notificación parental para las menores y un período de espera. La tasa de aborto está disminuyendo, ya que existen 241 por cada 1000 nacimientos, aunque sigue siendo superior al de la mayoría de las naciones occidentales.[193]​\n\nEl gasto en el sistema de atención a la salud sobrepasa al de cualquier otra nación, tanto en términos de gasto per cápita como en porcentaje del PIB.[194]​ En 2000, la Organización Mundial de la Salud colocó el sistema de salud estadounidense en primer lugar en la capacidad de respuesta, pero 37.º en rendimiento global. Estados Unidos es líder en innovación médica. En 2004, este sector invirtió tres veces más que cualquier país de Europa en la investigación biomédica.[195]​\n\nEstados Unidos es sede de muchos de los mejores centros médicos del mundo. Gran parte de las instalaciones médicas son de propiedad privada que cuentan con algunos subsidios del gobierno local. A pesar de ser asociaciones sin fines de lucro, muchos de los hospitales más importantes del país están afiliados a grandes corporaciones o escuelas de medicina, que han hecho posible que anualmente estos centros alberguen a cerca del 70 % de todos los pacientes médicos del país.[196]​ El Hospital Johns Hopkins, la Clínica Mayo, el Hospital General de Massachusetts y la Clínica Cleveland se encuentran entre los mejores hospitales del país y del mundo.[197]​\n\nA diferencia de otros países desarrollados, la cobertura del sistema de salud no es universal. En 2004, los seguros médicos pagaron el 36 % de los gastos en materia de salud y los gobiernos federales y estatales otorgaron el 44 %.[198]​ En 2005, 46.6 millones de estadounidenses, 15.9 % de la población, no estaban asegurados, 5.4 millones más que en 2001. La principal causa de este aumento es la caída en el número de empleos donde se garantiza el seguro médico.[199]​ El tema de los estadounidenses no asegurados es una cuestión política importante.[200]​[201]​ Un estudio de 2009 estimó que la falta de seguros está asociada con casi 45 000 muertes al año.[202]​ En 2006, Massachusetts se convirtió en el primer estado en implementar la asistencia sanitaria universal.[203]​ La ley federal aprobada a principios de 2010 creará un sistema de salud casi universal para todo el país en 2014.[cita requerida]\n\nDelincuencia y aplicación de la ley\n\nSegún datos de 2020, Estados Unidos tiene una tasa de homicidios intencionales de 7 por cada 100 000 habitantes.[205]​ Un análisis transversal de la base de datos de mortalidad de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2010 mostró que las tasas de homicidio de Estados Unidos fueron 7 veces más altas que en otros países de altos ingresos, impulsadas por una tasa de homicidios con armas de fuego que fue 25.2 veces más alta.[206]​ Entre 1980 y 2008 los hombres cometieron el 77 % de los homicidios y el 90 % de los crímenes. La población negra se vio involucrada en el 52.5 % de los homicidios, una proporción ocho veces mayor que la población blanca (incluyendo a la mayoría de hispanos como «blancos») y fueron víctimas en una proporción seis veces mayor que los blancos. La mayoría de homicidios fueron entre personas de la misma etnia, ya que un 93 % de los negros fueron asesinados por negros y un 84 % de los blancos por blancos.[207]​ De los países desarrollados, Estados Unidos es, con diferencia, el país que tiene un mayor índice de delitos con violencia, homicidios y violencia armada.[208]​ Un análisis de la Organización Mundial de la Salud de 2003 reveló que Estados Unidos «tenía una tasa de homicidios 6.9 veces superior a las tasas registradas en el resto de los países de ingresos altos, tasa impulsada al alza debido a que su tasa de homicidios por arma de fuego era 19.5 veces mayor».[209]​ El derecho a comprar y portar un arma de fuego, consagrado en la Segunda Enmienda a la Constitución, sigue siendo objeto de debate político y social.\n\nLa responsabilidad legal de aplicar y hacer cumplir las leyes en Estados Unidos recae principalmente en los cuerpos de policía local, en los alguaciles ―llamados sheriff o marshal, dependiendo del estado― y sus departamentos y en la policía estatal. A nivel federal existen varias agencias federales, como la Oficina Federal de Investigación (FBI) y el Cuerpo de Alguaciles de Estados Unidos, especializados en determinadas funciones.[210]​ A nivel federal y en casi todos los estados impera el derecho consuetudinario. En el país existen dos tipos de tribunales, los tribunales estatales, encargados de estudiar y juzgar delitos ordinarios, y los tribunales federales, encargados de juzgar ciertos delitos designados y resolver apelaciones procedentes de sentencias de tribunales estatales. Los acuerdos entre las partes es la forma más común de terminar los juicios, pues en la gran mayoría de casos penales se alcanza un acuerdo con el fiscal antes de celebrarse un juicio con jurado.[211]​[212]​\n\nLa pena de muerte sigue siendo un tipo de condena legalmente, y sigue contemplada para ciertos delitos federales y militares en 32 de los 50 estados del país.[213]​ Entre 1967 y 1977 no se realizó ninguna ejecución, debido, en parte, a un fallo de la Corte Suprema de los Estados Unidos que prohibía la imposición arbitraria de la pena capital. En 1976, el mismo tribunal dictaminó que, en circunstancias adecuadas, la pena de muerte podía aplicarse sin que ello violara la legalidad constitucional. Desde esta decisión, Estados Unidos ha ejecutado a más de 1300 reos, la mayoría de ellos en Texas, Virginia y Oklahoma.[214]​ Por otro lado, son varios los estados que han ido aboliendo por ley o simplemente dejado de aplicar la pena de muerte. En 2010, Estados Unidos fue el quinto país en número de ejecuciones, detrás de tan solo China, Irán, Corea del Norte y Yemen.[215]​\n\nEstados Unidos es el país con una mayor tasa de encarcelamiento documentado del mundo y tiene la mayor población carcelaria del mundo.[216]​[217]​ A inicios de 2008, más de 2.3 millones de personas estaban encarceladas, más de uno de cada 100 adultos del país.[218]​ Entre presos y personas en libertad condicional, el sistema penitenciario supervisaba a uno de cada 31 adultos del país en 2010,[219]​ cifra que para 2012 se había rebajado a 1 de cada 35 adultos (la tasa más baja desde 1997), haciendo un total de 6 937 600 personas.[220]​ La población carcelaria se ha cuadruplicado desde 1980.[221]​ El coste de mantener a los presos y las instalaciones, sumado a la construcción de nuevas prisiones debido a la masificación, asciende a más de sesenta mil millones de dólares anuales; esto provoca que algunos estados del país tengan que destinar al sistema penitenciario un 10 % de sus ingresos, en el caso de California, estado a la cabeza en número de prisioneros, en el año 2010 dedicó más dinero a esta faceta que, por ejemplo, a educación.[219]​ Los presos más comunes son los varones afroamericanos, con una tasa de encarcelados tres veces mayor que los hispanos y seis veces mayor que la de los varones blancos.[222]​ La alta tasa de presos puede explicarse en parte por las duras leyes promulgadas durante las últimas décadas para combatir el tráfico, posesión y consumo de drogas.[223]​ En 2008 Luisiana fue el estado con mayor tasa de encarcelados y Maine el de menor tasa.[224]​\n\nEl sistema penitenciario de Estados Unidos es duramente criticado tanto por analistas como por algunas organizaciones. Además de la privatización progresiva del sistema penitenciario desde la década de 1980, en 2014 la ONG Human Rights Watch y otras organizaciones denunciaron que más de ochenta mil presos se encuentran en celdas de aislamiento minúsculas, que las ONG califican como cámaras de tortura.[225]​ En 2012, The New York Times denunció que unos sesenta mil indocumentados recluidos en centros de detención son utilizados como mano de obra barata por el gobierno o empresas privadas, con salarios que pueden llegar a ser de 13 centavos la hora; en algunos casos ni siquiera se les retribuye.[226]​ Algunos estados también emplean a miles de reclusos de sus prisiones en fábricas de algunas empresas a cambio de la reducción de su condena o el salario mínimo. Esto supone un ahorro para las empresas de millones de dólares al año en salarios, aunque su legalidad está cuestionada.[227]​ Algunas de las empresas involucradas serían, directamente o a través de subcontrataciones, Microsoft, Boeing, Starbucks o Victoria’s Secret, entre otras.[227]​\n\nEstados Unidos es una nación multicultural, hogar de una amplia variedad de grupos étnicos, tradiciones y valores.[14]​[228]​ Aparte de las ahora pequeñas poblaciones de nativos americanos y hawaianos, casi todos los estadounidenses o sus antepasados emigraron durante los últimos cinco siglos. ​ La cultura común para la mayoría de los estadounidenses es una cultura occidental, que en gran parte proviene de las tradiciones de los inmigrantes europeos con influencias de muchas otras fuentes, tales como las tradiciones traídas por los esclavos de África.[14]​ ​ ​ Recientemente, los inmigrantes de Asia y Latinoamérica han añadido más elementos a esta mezcla cultural que ha sido descrita como «un crisol de razas homogeneizados y en una ensaladera heterogénea», en donde los inmigrantes y sus descendientes retienen, comparten y absorben varias características culturales distintivas.[14]​\n\nDe acuerdo con un análisis de dimensiones culturales elaborado por Geert Hofstede, Estados Unidos tiene uno de los índices de individualismo más alto que cualquier otro país estudiado.[232]​ Mientras que en la cultura popular se considera al país como una sociedad sin clases sociales, ​ varios estudiosos identifican diferencias significativas que pueden considerarse como clases sociales, que afectan a la socialización, el idioma y los valores.[234]​[235]​ La clase media trabajadora estadounidense ha sido la iniciadora de muchas de las tendencias sociales contemporáneas como el feminismo moderno, el ecologismo y el multiculturalismo.[236]​ A diferencia de otras culturas, la mayoría de las mujeres trabajan fuera del hogar y cuenta con alguna licenciatura.[237]​ En 2007, 58 % de las estadounidenses mayores de 18 años se habían casado, 6 % estaban viudas, 10 % se divorciaron y el 25 % nunca se había casado.[238]​\n\nEl mismo estudio de Hofstede también reveló que el punto de vista social de los estadounidenses, sus expectativas culturales y la imagen que tienen de sí mismos están asociadas con sus empleos y ocupaciones en un grado inusitadamente estrecho.[239]​ Así también se tiene la tendencia a valorar más los logros socioeconómicos, de tal modo que el hecho de ser una persona ordinaria o promedio es visto como un atributo positivo en la mayoría de los casos.[240]​ Pese a que el llamado «sueño americano» y la percepción de que los estadounidenses disfrutan de una alta movilidad social desempeñan un papel clave en la atracción de los inmigrantes, algunos analistas encuentran que Estados Unidos tiene una menor movilidad social que los países de Europa y Canadá.[241]​[242]​\n\nDesde la colonización europea, el arte estadunidense se mantuvo apegado a las corrientes artísticas del Viejo Continente. A mediados del siglo XIX, surgió la Escuela del río Hudson, uno de los primeros movimientos artísticos desarrollado en el país, aunque todavía se encontraba muy influenciado por la tradición europea del naturalismo. En 1913, el Armory Show de la ciudad de Nueva York, una exhibición de obras del arte moderno europeo, causó un gran impacto en el público y transformó la escena artística estadunidense.[243]​ Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley y otros artistas experimentaron con nuevos estilos, mostrando una sensibilidad y técnica sin precedentes en los artistas europeos. Los movimientos artísticos más importantes como el expresionismo abstracto de Jackson Pollock y Willem de Kooning y el pop art de Andy Warhol y Roy Lichtenstein se desarrollaron en gran medida en los Estados Unidos. De igual forma, la corriente del modernismo y el posmodernismo llevaron a la fama a varios arquitectos estadounidenses como Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson y Frank Gehry.\n\nUno de los más grandes promotores del teatro en Estados Unidos fue el empresario P. T. Barnum, quien se introdujo en el negocio del entretenimiento del bajo Manhattan en 1841. A finales de la década de 1870, el equipo Harrigan and Hart produjo una serie de comedias musicales muy exitosas en Nueva York. En el siglo XX, el formato para los musicales modernos emergió de Broadway; las canciones compuestas por personajes como Irving Berlin, Cole Porter y Stephen Sondheim se convirtieron en estándares para la música pop. El dramaturgo Eugene O'Neill ganó el Premio Nobel de Literatura en 1936; otros escritores estadounidenses aclamados incluyen a ganadores de un Premio Pulitzer, como Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee y August Wilson.\n\nCoreógrafos como Isadora Duncan y Martha Graham ayudaron al desarrollo de la danza moderna, mientras que George Balanchine y Jerome Robbins fueron dos de las grandes figuras del ballet del siglo XX. Los estadounidenses han jugado un papel importante en el medio artístico de la fotografía, destacando entre ellos Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen y Ansel Adams.\n\nLa primera función de cine en la historia se realizó en 1894 en la ciudad de Nueva York, utilizando el quinetoscopio de Thomas Edison. El año siguiente fue presentada la primera proyección de una película con fines comerciales, también en Nueva York, y durante las décadas siguientes Estados Unidos estuvo a la vanguardia del desarrollo del cine sonoro. Desde principios del siglo XX, la industria del cine estadounidense se ha centrado en gran medida alrededor de las producciones de Hollywood, California. El director D. W. Griffith fue fundamental para el desarrollo de la estructura básica de una película y Citizen Kane (1941) de Orson Welles es citada frecuentemente como la mejor película de todos los tiempos.[244]​[245]​ Otros directores fundamentales de esta nacionalidad en la historia del cine: John Ford, Howard Hawks, Elia Kazan o Michael Curtiz, y, entre los más recientes, Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola o Steven Spielberg. Actores estadounidenses como Humphrey Bogart, John Wayne o Marilyn Monroe se han convertido en figuras icónicas, mientras que el productor y empresario Walt Disney fue uno de los líderes en la animación y el merchandising de sus películas. Los estudios de cine más importantes de Hollywood han producido las películas comercialmente más exitosas en la historia, tales como Star Wars (1977), Titanic (1997) o Avatar (2009). Para la década de 2020, los productos de Hollywood continuarán dominando la industria cinematográfica a nivel mundial.[246]​\n\nCon la historieta, la producción estadounidense ha perdido el liderazgo que ostentaba a nivel mundial desde principios del siglo XX, destacando varias tiras de prensa como Flash Gordon, The Phantom o El Príncipe Valiente. Luego de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el cómic se convirtió en un medio minoritario que recientemente vive el fenómeno de la novela gráfica, en el que destacan autores como Charles Burns, Joe Sacco o Chris Ware. No obstante, las tiras cómicas y las historietas también son parte del legado artístico del país. Por ejemplo, Superman, uno de los superhéroes más conocidos dentro de este medio, se ha convertido en todo un ícono nacional. ​\n\nEstados Unidos tiene la mayor cantidad de televidentes en el mundo,[248]​ a la vez que el promedio de tiempo dedicado a ella sigue en aumento, llegando a cinco horas al día en 2006.[249]​ Las cuatro cadenas de televisión más importantes son todas entidades comerciales. Los estadounidenses también escuchan programas de radio, en gran medida comercializados, en promedio durante dos y media horas al día.[250]​ Los sitios web y motores de búsqueda más populares de la red son inventiva estadounidense, incluidos Google, Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Blogger, eBay y Yahoo!.[251]​\n\nEn cuanto a la música, la obra de Charles Ives de la década de 1910, en gran parte ignorada durante su desarrollo, lo llevó a convertirse en el primer compositor de música clásica estadounidense exitoso; otros pioneros como Henry Cowell y John Cage crearon un enfoque estadounidense dentro de las composiciones clásicas. Aaron Copland y George Gershwin desarrollaron una mezcla única de música clásica con música popular.\n\nLos estilos rítmicos y líricos de la música afroamericana han influido profundamente en la música de Estados Unidos en general, distinguiéndola de las tradiciones europeas. Elementos de la música folclórica, como el blues y lo que ahora se conoce como old music fueron adaptados y transformados en géneros populares para una audiencia global. El jazz fue desarrollado por artistas innovadores tales como Louis Armstrong y Duke Ellington a principios del siglo XX. El country surgió en la década de 1920 y el rhythm and blues en la década de 1940. A mediados de la siguiente década, Elvis Presley y Chuck Berry estuvieron entre los pioneros del rock and roll. En la década de 1960, el surgimiento de la carrera de Bob Dylan ayudó a revivir la influencia de la música folclórica, para convertirse en uno de los compositores más célebres del país; al mismo tiempo, James Brown lideró el desarrollo del funk. Las más recientes creaciones estadounidenses incluyen el hip hop y la música house. Finalmente, estrellas de la música popular estadounidense como Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift e Eminem se han convertido en celebridades mundiales. ​\n\nDurante el siglo XVIII y principios del siglo XIX, la literatura estadunidense tomaba la mayoría de sus influencias de Europa. A mediados del siglo XIX, escritores como Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe y Henry David Thoreau establecieron una literatura propia del país. Mark Twain y el poeta Walt Whitman fueron dos de las grandes figuras de la segunda mitad del siglo; Emily Dickinson, virtualmente desconocida durante su vida, también es considerada como una de las poetisas más importantes de la literatura estadounidense. ​ Una obra que captura aspectos fundamentales de la vida en el país en sus personajes ―tales como Moby-Dick (1851) de Herman Melville, Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn (1885) de Mark Twain y El gran Gatsby (1925) de F. Scott Fitzgerald― puede ser considerada como la «gran novela estadounidense».\n\nOnce ciudadanos estadounidenses han ganado el Premio Nobel de Literatura, siendo el más reciente Toni Morrison en 1993. William Faulkner y Ernest Hemingway, ganadores en los años 1949 y 1954, respectivamente, a menudo son catalogados entre los escritores más influyentes del siglo XX. ​ Varios géneros literarios populares como los del viejo oeste y la novela negra se desarrollaron en el país. Los escritores de la generación beat (Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs…) abrieron el campo a nuevas formas literarias, así como a autores posmodernistas como John Barth, Thomas Pynchon y Don DeLillo. Merece la pena mencionar asimismo a otros poetas y escritores tan importantes como Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, Gore Vidal, Truman Capote, el nacionalizado Vladimir Nabokov, Raymond Carver, y, dentro de la literatura fantástica, son de renombre internacional H. P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, Ray Bradbury, Stephen King, etc.\n\nEn el campo de la filosofía, los trascendentalistas, liderados por Henry Thoreau y Ralph Waldo Emerson, establecieron el primer movimiento filosófico importante del país. Después de la Guerra de Secesión, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James y John Dewey fueron los líderes del desarrollo del pragmatismo. En el siglo XX, las obras de W. V. O. Quine, Richard Rorty y Noam Chomsky, trajeron la filosofía analítica a las academias estadounidenses. En décadas más recientes, John Rawls y Robert Nozick fueron dos de los líderes más importantes del resurgimiento de la filosofía política.\n\nLa gastronomía de Estados Unidos es similar a la de otros países occidentales, con el trigo siendo el cereal más utilizado. La cocina tradicional estadunidense utiliza ingredientes como el pavo, carne de ciervo, papas, camotes, maíz, calabazas, miel de maple y otros elementos indígenas utilizados por los amerindios y los primeros colonizadores europeos. Parrilladas de puerco y res, tortas de cangrejo, papas chips y las galletas con chispas de chocolate son algunos de los platos hechos al «estilo estadounidense». La soul food, la cocina tradicional de los esclavos africanos, es aún popular en el sur y entre los afroamericanos de otras partes del país. Las gastronomías sincréticas, como la cocina criolla de Luisiana, la cajún y la tex-mex, tienen gran importancia regional.\n\nPlatos característicos como la tarta de manzana, el pollo frito, la pizza, la hamburguesa y el perrito caliente provienen de recetas introducidas por los inmigrantes. Las papas fritas, los platillos mexicanos como los burritos y tacos y los platillos con pastas adaptados de recetas italianas también son ampliamente consumidos.[255]​ En el consumo de bebidas, los estadounidenses prefieren el café en vez del té. La publicidad de las industrias estadounidenses ha hecho que el jugo de naranja y la leche sean las bebidas típicas de un desayuno. ​ ​ El consumo frecuente de comida rápida está asociado con lo que los médicos llaman «epidemia de obesidad». Las gaseosas son ampliamente populares: el azúcar contenido en ellas aporta el 9 % de la ingesta calórica promedio.[258]​[259]​\n\nEstados Unidos es pionero en la investigación científica y la innovación tecnológica desde el siglo XIX. En 1876, Alexander Graham Bell recibió la primera patente para un estadounidense por el teléfono.[260]​ El laboratorio de Thomas Edison desarrolló el fonógrafo, la primera lámpara incandescente y el primer proyector de películas. Nikola Tesla fue precursor en experimentar con la corriente alterna, el motor de corriente alterna y la radio. En el siglo XX, las compañías de automóviles de Ransom Eli Olds y Henry Ford promovieron la producción en cadena. En 1903, los hermanos Wright realizaron el primer vuelo propulsado en su aeronave Wright Flyer.[261]​\n\nEl ascenso del nazismo en la década de 1930 llevó a muchos científicos europeos, incluyendo a Albert Einstein y Enrico Fermi, a emigrar al país. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el proyecto Manhattan ya había desarrollado las primeras armas nucleares, anunciando el inicio de la era nuclear. La carrera espacial también produjo avances rápidos en la construcción y el desarrollo de cohetes, la ciencia de materiales y la informática. El país fue responsable del desarrollo de la ARPANET y su sucesor, Internet. Hoy en día, la mayor parte de los ingresos para la investigación y desarrollo, un 64%, provienen del sector privado.[262]​ El país es líder mundial en publicaciones de investigación científica y en el factor de impacto.[263]​ Los estadounidenses poseen bienes de consumo tecnológicamente avanzados[264]​[265]​[266]​ y casi la mitad de los hogares tienen acceso a Internet de banda ancha.[267]​ También es el principal desarrollador y cultivador de organismos genéticamente modificados; más de la mitad de las tierras con cultivos biotecnológicos del mundo se encuentran en Estados Unidos.[268]​\n\nSegún el Índice Mundial de Innovación, a cargo de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, en su versión 2024, Estados Unidos se ubica en el tercer lugar de dicho índice.[269]​ Desde 2023, fue desplazado del segundo lugar que ocupó en 2022, por Suecia.[270]​ [271]​[272]​ En ediciones anteriores a 2022, de este índice, Estados Unidos obtuvo la posición número 3, en los cuales el primer lugar ha sido siempre ocupado por Suiza.[273]​[274]​\n\nDesde finales del siglo XIX, el béisbol se considera como el deporte nacional, mientras que el fútbol americano, el baloncesto y el hockey sobre hielo son los otros tres grandes deportes de conjunto a nivel profesional. Las ligas universitarias también atraen a grandes audiencias. El fútbol americano es el deporte más popular en Estados Unidos.[276]​[277]​ El boxeo y las carreras de caballos fueron en su momento los deportes individuales más vistos, pero han sido eclipsados por el golf y el automovilismo, particularmente por los campeonatos Stock Cars como la más importante Copa NASCAR y otras categorías nacionales y regionales de NASCAR y ARCA. Otros campeonatos de monoplazas reseñables son la IndyCar, anteriormente la desaparecida Championship Auto Racing Teams y las carreras de resistencia como la United SportsCar Championship. Una de las principales carreras de Estados Unidos son las 500 Millas de Indianapolis de la IndyCar, que cuenta con prestigio internacional. Las carreras de resistencia como las 24 Horas de Daytona, 12 Horas de Sebring y la Petit Le Mans son de igual importancia en el automovilismo mundial. Las 500 millas de Daytona de la copa NASCAR es la carrera más importante de los Stock Cars del mundo. El fútbol, aunque no es uno de los principales deportes a nivel profesional en el país, tiene gran presencia y nivel de aficionados. El tenis y otros deportes de exterior también son populares junto al Abierto de Estados Unidos, uno de los campeonatos de tenis más vistos del mundo.\n\nSi bien la mayoría de los deportes importantes de los Estados Unidos han evolucionado de prácticas europeas, el baloncesto, el voleibol, la animación y el snowboarding son invenciones locales. El lacrosse y el surf surgieron de los amerindios y de los nativos de Hawái.\n\nEl Comité Olímpico de los Estados Unidos (USOC) fue anfitrión de los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano en cuatro ocasiones: San Luis 1904, Los Ángeles 1932, Los Ángeles 1984 y Atlanta 1996, y de los Juegos de Invierno en cuatro ocasiones: Lake Placid 1932, Squaw Valley 1960, Lake Placid 1980 y Salt Lake City 2002.[278]​ Estados Unidos organizará los juegos de verano de 2028 en Los Ángeles y los de invierno de 2034 en Salt Lake City. Estados Unidos ha ganado 2781 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Verano, más que ningún otro país y 330 medallas en los Juegos Olímpicos de Invierno.[279]​\n• Anexo:Patrimonio de la Humanidad en Estados Unidos\n• Anexo:Banderas de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Anexo:Presidentes de los Estados Unidos\n• Estado de los Estados Unidos de América\n• Medios de comunicación en Estados Unidos\n• None .

Directly north of Pasadena, it is located approximately 14 miles (23 km) from Downtown Los Angeles. Its population was 42,846 at the 2020 census, up slightly from a 2010 figure of 42,777. In early 2025, the community was impacted by the Eaton Fire.\n\nThe name Altadena was coined from the Spanish alta, meaning \"upper\", and dena from Pasadena; the area is adjacent to, but at a higher elevation than, Pasadena.[6][7]\n\nIn the mid-1860s, Benjamin S. Eaton first developed water sources from the Arroyo Seco and Eaton Canyon to irrigate his vineyard near the edge of Eaton Canyon. This made possible the development of Altadena, Pasadena, and South Pasadena. He did the construction for B. D. Wilson and Dr. John Griffin, who jointly owned the Mexican land grant of Rancho San Pascual, about 14,000 acres (5,700 ha), that would be the future sites of these three communities. They hoped to develop and sell this land in a real estate plan called the San Pasqual Plantation. Their efforts failed by 1870, despite Eaton's irrigation ditch that drew water from the site of present-day Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the Arroyo Seco, because the land was relatively inaccessible and few believed crops could thrive that close to the mountains.\n\nEaton tried to sell the land for the partners, and in late 1873 he helped broker a deal with Daniel Berry, who represented a group of investors from Indiana, to buy 4,000 acres (1,600 ha) of the rancho. This included the land of present-day Altadena, but they developed a 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) section further south as Pasadena.\n\nByron O. Clark established a nursery in the foothills in 1875, which he named \"Altadena Nursery\", a name he coined from the Spanish alta meaning \"upper\" and dena from Pasadena.\n\nIn 1880 or 1881, Capt. Frederick Woodbury, and his brother, John Woodbury of Marshalltown, Iowa, purchased 937 acres (379 ha) known as the Woodbury Ranch. The land remained primarily agricultural, though several Eastern millionaires built mansions along Mariposa Street, and a small community developed through the 1890s and into the next century.\n\nJohn Woodbury established the Pasadena Improvement Company in 1887, with a plot plan of residential development referred to as the Woodbury Subdivision. They contacted Byron O. Clark, who had moved away, and asked if he could use the name \"Altadena\" for his subdivision; Clark agreed.\n\nThe newly-sprouted community of Altadena immediately began to attract millionaires from the East. In 1887 Andrew McNally, the printing magnate from Chicago, and his friend, George Gill Green, had built mansions on what was to become Millionaire's Row: Mariposa Street near Santa Rosa Avenue. Newspaper moguls William Armiger Scripps and William Kellogg built homes side by side just east of Fair Oaks Avenue. A bit farther east, Zane Grey bought a home from Arthur Herbert Woodward, and added a second-floor study. The famous Benziger Publishing Company built a mansion on the corner of Santa Rosa Avenue (Christmas Tree Lane) and Mariposa. Mariposa was taken from the Spanish name for a butterfly. The grandson of Andrew McNally, Wallace Neff, became a famous Southern California architect. He started his career in Altadena with the design and construction of St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church (parish est. 1918), which was dedicated in October 1926.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1926, 160 homes were built in Altadena by fugitive conman Elisha Paul Janes, with distinctive steep roofs and multiple gables; despite his lack of qualifications, they proved popular, and this neighbourhood was designated as a heritage area in 2002.[8][9] Many notable buildings followed in the 1930s, including Eliot Junior High School (1931) and Davies Community Center in Farnsworth Park (1934).[10]\n\nRedlining policies prevented African Americans from acquiring land or purchasing property in much of California.[11][12] One of the areas exempt from these policies was Altadena Meadows, which thrived and became one of first middle-class African American neighborhoods in the area.[12][13]\n\nWhile Altadena long refused wholesale annexation by neighboring Pasadena, the larger community nibbled at its edges in several small annexations of neighborhoods through the 1940s. Attempted annexation was stopped in 1956 by community campaigns, though it has been resurrected several times since by Pasadena without success. Had the annexation succeeded, Pasadena would be the 108th largest city in the United States.\n\nWith early-1960s redevelopment in Pasadena, the routing of extensions of the 134 and 210 freeways, and lawsuits over the desegregation of Pasadena Unified School District, there was white flight and convulsive racial change in Altadena. In 1960, its black population was under four percent; over the next 15 years, half the White population left, and was replaced by people of color, many of whom settled on the west side of town after being displaced by Pasadena's redevelopment and freeway projects.\n\nIn 1993, the Kinneloa Fire, begun accidentally on the slopes above Eaton Canyon, burned dozens of homes in Altadena and neighboring Kinneloa Mesa as part of a rash of late October wildfires driven by Santa Ana winds in Southern California. One man died of complications from smoke inhalation and dozens were injured.[14][15]\n\nIn 2022, Altadena gained local coverage in Los Angeles as the place of the first land return to the Tongva since the arrival of Europeans in the Los Angeles Basin area, after a resident donated her 1 acre property to the Tongva Taraxat Paxaavxa Conservancy.[16][17] It was described as marking the first time in nearly 200 years that the Tongva have had land in Los Angeles County.[18]\n\nIn 2022 Altadena gained national media coverage, as it was the location where a single lottery ticket was sold to Edwin Castro, which would win a world record US$2.04 billion Powerball jackpot.[19]\n\nOn January 7, 2025, the Eaton Fire started in Altadena around 6:30 PM local time. It quickly spread to 14,000 acres by January 10, with 5 confirmed fatalities. Over 7,000 structures were damaged or destroyed, including the Andrew McNally House, Altadena Community Church, St. Mark's Episcopal Church, The Bunny Museum, Scripps Hall and much of the downtown area. The entirety of Altadena was put under an evacuation order.[20]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 8.7 square miles (23 km2), over 99% of it land.\n\nAltadena experiences hot and dry summers that are followed by warm and windy falls and mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Altadena has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated Csa on climate maps.\n\nThe wettest calendar year was 1983, with 48.47 inches (1,231.1 mm), and the driest was 1947, with 5.37 inches (136.4 mm). The most rainfall in one month was 19.70 inches (500.4 mm), in February 1980. The most rainfall in 24 hours was 7.70 inches (195.6 mm), on March 2, 1938. Altadena averages 21.09 inches (535.7 mm) of rain a year, over 6 inches (150 mm) more than nearby Los Angeles due to the orographic effect created by the San Gabriel Mountains. Because of the slope on which the city is built, sewer lines in the city's northern section have been known to overflow significantly.[citation needed]\n\nAltadena first appeared as an unincorporated community in the 1960 U.S. Census;[33] and as a census-designated place in the 1980 U.S. Census.[35]\n\nThe 2020 United States census[42] reported that Altadena had a population of 42,846. The racial makeup of Altadena in the year 2020 was (53.2%) White (41.2% Non-Hispanic White),[43] (19.7%) African American, (0.6%) Native American, (5.2%) Asian, (0.1%) Pacific Islander, and (6.9%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 29.5% of the population.\n\nThe 2010 United States census[44] reported that Altadena had a population of 42,777. The population density was 4,900.4 inhabitants per square mile (1,892.1/km2). The racial makeup of Altadena in the year 2010 was 22,569 (52.8%) White (40.3% Non-Hispanic White),[43] 10,136 (23.7%) African American, 300 (0.7%) Native American, 2,307 (5.4%) Asian, 71 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 4,852 (11.3%) from other races, and 2,542 (5.9%) from two or more races. There were 11,502 Hispanic or Latino residents, of any race (26.9%).\n\nThe Census reported that 42,276 people (98.8% of the population) lived in households, 234 (0.5%) lived in non-institutionalized group quarters, and 267 (0.6%) were institutionalized.\n\nThere were 15,212 households, out of which 5,170 (34.0%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 7,684 (50.5%) were opposite-sex married couples living together, 2,210 (14.5%) had a female householder with no husband present, 814 (5.4%) had a male householder with no wife present. There were 661 (4.3%) unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 271 (1.8%) same-sex married couples or partnerships. 3,489 households (22.9%) were made up of individuals, and 1,318 (8.7%) had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.78. There were 10,708 families (70.4% of all households); the average family size was 3.26.\n\nThe age distribution of the city's population was as follows: 9,507 people (22.2%) were under the age of 18, 3,286 (7.7%) aged 18 to 24, 10,622 (24.8%) aged 25 to 44, 13,298 (31.1%) aged 45 to 64, and 6,064 (14.2%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41.8 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.2 males.\n\nThere were 15,947 housing units at an average density of 1,826.8 per square mile (705.3/km2), of which 10,889 (71.6%) were owner-occupied, and 4,323 (28.4%) were occupied by renters. The homeowner vacancy rate was 0.9%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.9%. 30,319 people (70.9% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 11,957 people (28.0%) lived in rental housing units.\n\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Altadena had a median household income of $82,895, with 10.7% of the population living below the federal poverty line.[43]\n\nAs of the 2000 United States census,[45] there were 42,610 people, 14,780 households, and 10,671 families residing in the CDP.

He represented their C team after being loaned to CD Onda for one year.[2]\n\nIn the summer of 2013, after brief spells with CD El Palo[3] and Huracán Valencia CF,[4] Doménech signed for Valencia CF, and was assigned to the reserves in the Segunda División B.[5] In both of his seasons, the side narrowly avoided relegation with him as first choice.[6]\n\nDoménech was promoted to the main squad for the 2015–16 campaign by manager Nuno Espírito Santo. On 12 September, profiting from injuries to both Diego Alves and Mathew Ryan, he played his first match in La Liga, a 1–0 away win against Sporting de Gijón where he put in a player of the match performance.[7][8] The following day, the club announced he had renewed his contract until 2018.[9]\n\nDoménech was backup to another Brazilian, Neto, in 2017–18. He started in the team's semi-final run in the Copa del Rey, notably saving two penalties in the shootout against Deportivo Alavés in the quarter-finals.[10][11] In the following edition of the tournament he appeared in every game for the winners,[12] including the 2–1 victory over FC Barcelona in the final.[13] On 18 May 2019, he made a rare league appearance on the last day of the season away to Real Valladolid, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win to qualify for the UEFA Champions League.[14]\n\nDoménech signed new contracts in September 2016[15] and November 2019, tying him to Valencia until 2023 and enacting a buyout clause of €50 million.[16] In the summer of 2020, the club wanted to offload his competitor Jasper Cillessen due to financial problems but this never transpired;[17] nonetheless, in the ensuing season he played the majority of league games for the first time due to the Dutchman's injuries.[18]\n\nThird-choice to new signing Giorgi Mamardashvili and Cillessen during the 2021–22 campaign, Doménech became a backup after the latter left, but suffered a serious knee injury on 8 September 2022.[19] The following day, he further extended his contract until 2025.[20]Jaume Doménech - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Jaume Domènech Sánchez (Almenara, Castellón, 5 de noviembre de 1990) es un futbolista español que juega como portero en el Valencia C. F. de la Primera División de España.\n\nSu primer entrenador fue el exdelantero José Vicente Forment en la U.D. Almenara,[2]​ y luego pasó a las categorías inferiores del Villarreal Club de Fútbol. Estuvo en el equipo Juvenil A, luego cedido al C.D. Onda y finalmente jugó en el Villarreal \"C\" y alguna participación en el Villarreal \"B\".[3]​\n\nEn 2012 deja el Villarreal y ficha por el C.D. El Palo, de la Tercera División malagueña. El equipo no conoció la derrota mientras Jaume defendió la portería en la primera parte de la temporada 2012/13, 14 partidos consecutivos, pero en el mercado invernal, le llegó la oportunidad de volver a tierras valencianas cuando recibió la llamada del club Huracán Valencia de la Segunda División B.[4]​ En el equipo valenciano no gozó de todo el protagonismo que le habría gustado, pero el equipo estuvo cerca de ascender de categoría.\n\nEn verano de 2013 le llegó la llamada del Valencia Mestalla, por petición expresa del que fuera su técnico en el Huracán Valencia y nuevo técnico del filial valencianista, Nico Estévez.[5]​ Llegó a priori para ser el suplente de Yeray Gómez, pero se hizo rápidamente con la titularidad. Lesiones puntuales de los porteros del primer equipo, Guaita y Alves, hacían que fuese convocado con el primer equipo valencianista pero sin llegar a debutar.[6]​\n\nEn 2014, con la salida de Guaita, hizo la pretemporada con el primer equipo y dejó unas excelentes sensaciones en técnicos y aficionados, pero el club decidió incorporar a un portero con experiencia en Primera División como Yoel Rodríguez del Celta. Este hecho mantuvo a Jaume como tercer portero del primer equipo, pero disputando los partidos con el Valencia Mestalla en Segunda B. En octubre sufrió una desafortunada lesión que le hizo perder un mes de competición,[7]​ y luego otro susto a finales de noviembre.[8]​ Esto provocó que la titularidad pasara a Álex Sánchez, pero poco después recuperó la titularidad ya para todo el último tercio de la temporada.\n\nEl verano de 2015 fue el más decisivo en su carrera, ya que le quedaba un año de contrato con el club, y además por edad (24 años) la normativa le impedía compaginar convocatorias con el primer equipo y jugar partidos con el filial. Tanto el club como Jaume debían tomar una decisión. La grave lesión de Diego Alves en mayo hizo que el club decidiera reforzar la portería con el australiano Ryan, pero aun así el club debía escoger entre Jaume o Yoel.\n\nEl técnico Nuno convenció a Jaume para que no se marchara, a pesar de tener ofertas en Segunda División,[9]​ y la idea era dar salida a Yoel, pero una inesperada lesión de Ryan hizo que finalmente el Valencia Club de Fútbol se quedara con los tres porteros en el primer equipo para tener guardametas de garantías.\n\nLa elección del portero titular fue difícil, porque Nuno debía elegir entre la energía y las ganas de Jaume o la experiencia de Yoel, pero finalmente apostó por Jaume como titular y debutó el 12 de septiembre de 2015 en El Molinón en la 3.ª jornada de Liga. El resultado final fue de victoria valencianista por 0-1 con gol de Paco Alcácer en el minuto 91, y la actuación de Jaume Domènech fue estelar y clave para que el equipo no encajara ningún gol.[10]​ Justo al día siguiente se anunció oficialmente la renovación del contrato de Jaume con el club, hasta el año 2018 con una cláusula de rescisión de 30 millones de euros,[11]​ aunque el acuerdo ya estaba cerrado desde que Nuno convenciera al jugador para quedarse. Tres días después debutó como titular en Mestalla en la primera jornada de la Liga de Campeones frente al Zenit, con peor fortuna al caer derrotado el equipo por 2-3,[12]​ pero en los siguientes partidos volvió a ser el héroe del equipo realizando paradas espectaculares frente al Granada[13]​ y al Olympique de Lyon.[14]​\n\nContinuó con la titularidad mientras se alargaba la lesión de Ryan,[15]​ y detuvo su primer penal en la 8.ª jornada al especialista del Málaga, Duda,[16]​ jugada que el público de Mestalla celebró como si de un gol se tratase. La conexión entre Jaume y la grada era magnífica y, tras la salida de Yoel al Rayo y la recuperación de Ryan, siguió Jaume siendo el titular indiscutible y mejor jugador de la irregular campaña valencianista, salvando muchos puntos al equipo y llegando a ser a finales de noviembre el mejor portero de la Liga en porcentaje de paradas en aquel momento, por delante de Bravo.[17]​[18]​ Inexplicablemente Nuno le quitó la titularidad en la 13.ª jornada en el Sánchez Pizjuán, pero el siguiente partido volvió al once frente al Barcelona con Voro en el banquillo.\n\nEn la 15.ª jornada, en el debut liguero de Gary Neville, volvió a salvar al equipo, esta vez en Ipurúa, con grandes paradas y al final deteniendo su segundo penal de la temporada , y esta vez detuvo el lanzamiento al delantero Saúl Berjón.[19]​ Al finalizar la primera vuelta, la LFP lo consideró el portero protagonista de todo el campeonato durante las primeras 19 jornadas, considerándolo uno de los porteros más prometedores de la liga y destacando sus brillantes actuaciones, sus reflejos y su capacidad para detener penales en momentos comprometidos.[20]​ Aun así, tras la 19.ª jornada, la titularidad tanto en Liga como en Copa pasó a Maty Ryan por decisión de Gary Neville tras una floja actuación de Jaume en Anoeta, una decisión discutida aunque acompañada también de grandes actuaciones del portero australiano. Tras el mercado de invierno cambió su dorsal 24 por el 13 (que había dejado libre Yoel), ya que el 24 pasó a la nueva incorporación de Cheryshev. En la segunda vuelta de la temporada, con la recuperación del brasileño Diego Alves, no disputó ningún minuto hasta la última jornada contra la Real Sociedad en Mestalla y la vuelta de las semifinales de Copa, en ambos casos sin nada en juego.\n\nEn verano de 2016 fue uno de los futbolistas que el club más utilizabá como imagen a nivel local e internacional, como demuestra su viaje a Singapur junto a otros compañeros,[21]​ dando abiertamente su opinión sobre Lim.[22]​ El club barajaba el posible traspaso de Diego Alves para mantener en la portería a Jaume y Ryan, pero finalmente el brasileño siguió en el equipo y fue el portero titular. A pesar de ello el club mostró su confianza en Jaume renovando de nuevo su contrato, esta vez hasta 2022,[23]​ y el australiano Ryan, con además problemas físicos, pasó a ser el tercer portero y en el mercado de invierno salió cedido. El 28 de octubre hizo de anfitrión en Almenara en un encuentro entre siete jugadores de la plantilla, exfutbolistas y peñistas con niños y vecinos de la localidad.[24]​ En liga fue suplente de Alves para todos los técnicos durante la temporada, y fue el portero titular en las dos eliminatorias de Copa.\n\nEn la temporada 2017-18 el club incorporó al brasileño Neto y traspasó a Alves, Ryan y Sivera, con lo que Jaume se quedó como segundo portero para el técnico Marcelino García Toral y siendo uno de los capitanes de la plantilla tras Parejo, Rodrigo y Gayà. Disputó solo un partido de liga pero todas las eliminatorias de la Copa del Rey hasta las semifinales, siendo capitán del equipo en los últimos minutos del partido de vuelta frente al Real Zaragoza y en los dos encuentros frente a Las Palmas. Fue el protagonista en la decisiva eliminatoria de cuartos de final frente al Deportivo Alavés, que se decidió en la tanda de penales y logró detener dos disparos.[25]​\n\nLa temporada 2018-19 fue muy especial para Jaume. Siguió siendo el portero suplente de Neto pero fue el titular en todos los partidos de la Copa del Rey, llegando incluso hasta la final en la que el equipo se proclamó campeón del torneo el 25 de mayo de 2019 en el estadio Benito Villamarín, logrando así su primer título ganando 2-1 al Barcelona.[26]​ Además se confirmó como uno de los pesos pesados de la plantilla siendo por ejemplo el representante de los jugadores en actos del centenario del club como la marcha que tuvo lugar el 18 de marzo de 2019.[27]​\n\nLos problemas de Neto con el técnico Marcelino[28]​ hicieron que el brasileño fuese traspasado y llegase el holandés Cillessen con la presumible titularidad. Con Albert Celades de técnico en la temporada 2019-20 parte como suplente, pero los problemas físicos de Cillessen le dan opción de jugar a principios de diciembre,[29]​ y se alzó con la titularidad incluso tras la recuperación del holandés, pasando a ser titular durante nueve jornadas consecutivas, participando también en la Supercopa,[30]​ y en la Copa, siendo el salvador del equipo de nuevo en una tanda de penaltis.[31]​ También participó en dos partidos de Champions,[32]​ lo que supuso un total de 21 partidos disputados a lo largo de la temporada, una cifra muy cercana a los 24 encuentros que disputó en su temporada de debut 2015-16.\n\nLa 2020-21 fue una temporada en la que el club necesitaba traspasar a los futbolistas con mayor peso económico en la plantilla y uno de ellos era Cillessen,[33]​ que además no había mostrado su mejor versión en Valencia, pero finalmente el neerlandés siguió en el equipo pero sin contar demasiado para el técnico Javi Gracia, con lo que Jaume se hizo con la titularidad indiscutible para el entrenador. Además los traspasos de Parejo, Rodrigo y Kondogbia, tres de los capitanes, hicieron al portero convertirse en el 2.º capitán del equipo por detrás de José Luis Gayà.[34]​ Tras dos meses de titulariad de Jaume hubo dudas entre la afición y la prensa sobre la idoneidad de la titularidad de Jaume,[35]​ pero justo cuando Cillessen iba a tener su oportunidad sufrió una grave lesión,[36]​ lo cual hizo mantener la titularidad a Jaume en todos los encuentros y empezar a salvar el resultado en varios encuentros con sus paradas.[37]​ Llegó a participar en un total de 27 partidos, por tanto se convirtió en la temporada en la que más partidos disputó con el equipo.\n\nEn la temporada 2021-22, a las órdenes del técnico José Bordalás, llegó a la plantilla un joven portero que llegaba para el equipo filial, Giorgi Mamardashvili, pero sorprendió a todos con su magnífico rendimiento y se quedó en el primer equipo disputando la titularidad a Cillessen. Jaume siguió siendo uno de los capitanes junto a Gayà y Carlos Soler, pero solo disputó las cinco primeras eliminatorias de la Copa del Rey.

Son bourg est à 5,5 au nord-ouest de Tessy-sur-Vire, à 8,5 au sud-ouest de Condé-sur-Vire et à 12 au sud de Saint-Lô[1].\n\nLe territoire est traversé du nord au sud par la route départementale 28 qui passe par le bourg et mène à Tessy-sur-Vire au sud et à Saint-Romphaire et Saint-Lô au nord. La D 77 permet de rejoindre Saint-Samson-de-Bonfossé au nord-ouest et la D 396 Troisgots à l'est. L'accès à l'A84 (sortie 39) est situé à 10 au sud, par Tessy-sur-Vire.\n\nLe Mesnil-Opac est dans le bassin de la Vire, par ses sous-affluents le ruisseau de Dillon, qui délimite le territoire à l'ouest, et le ruisseau de Bricqueville le limitant à l'est. Ces deux ruisseaux rejoignent le Marqueran sur la commune voisine, Moyon, rivière qui conflue avec la Vire entre Fervaches et Troisgots. Les hauteurs entre les deux vallons, sur lesquelles est situé le bourg, sont parcourues par la route départementale 77.\n\nLe point culminant (161 ) se situe au nord-ouest, près du lieu-dit la Héroudière. Le point le plus bas (65 ) correspond à la sortie du ruisseau du Dillon du territoire, au sud. La commune est bocagère.\n\nLe climat est océanique, comme dans tout l'Ouest de la France. La station météorologique la plus proche est Granville-Pointe du Roc, à 40 , mais Caen-Carpiquet est à près de 50 [2]. Le Pays saint-lois s'en différencie toutefois pour la pluviométrie annuelle qui, au Mesnil-Opac, avoisine les 1 000 [3].\n\nLes lieux-dits sont, du nord-ouest à l'ouest, dans le sens horaire : la Riquerie, la Carbonnerie, les Noës, le Crespin, la Hédouvière, la Fosse Fouquet, les Champins, le Pivelet (au nord), la Tringale, le Petit Bricqueville, la Morandière, la Lande, le Grand Bricqueville, le Bourg (à l'est), la Faverie, Bonne Louise, les Hayes, la Perette, le Brisault, le Champ Hue (au sud), les Vaux, la Tosnardière, le Dillon, le Champ Pommier, le Beaussemay, le Hamel Gosselin (à l'ouest), la Maison Neuve et le Bouessais[4].\n\nLe nom de la localité est attesté sous les formes latinisées Maisnillo Ospac en 1180 - 1189[6] ou Mesnillo Ospac en 1180[7] et Maisnillum Ospac en 1180-1189[8],[6].\n\nIl s'agit d'une formation toponymique médiévale en Mesnil-, appellatif toponymique caractéristique du nord de la France, dont la forme primitive est Maisnil, d'où les attestations anciennes en Maisnil-. Il est issu ultimement du gallo-roman *MASIONILE, c'est-à-dire bas latin ma(n)sion- « séjour, lieu de séjour, habitation, demeure, auberge » (de manere « rester, demeurer », v. manoir) qui n'existe au sens de « maison » qu'en gallo-roman et dans les parlers septentrionaux (cf. maison), il est suivi du suffixe -ile[9].\n\nLe second élément -Opac représente l'anthroponyme norrois Ospakr[8],[6] (souvent latinisé en Ospachus[7] dans les textes écrits en latin médiéval). En vieux norrois, ce nom de personne est plus précisément noté Óspakr ou ÓspakR[10]. Il remonte au mot úspakr qui signifie « sauvage, indiscipliné, tête brûlée », composé des éléments u-, préfixe négatif (correspondant à l'anglais et à l'allemand un-), suivi de spak « sensé, sage »[10]. L'anthroponyme Ospac est exceptionnel dans la toponymie normande.\n\nBricqueville appartient à la série des Bricqueville normands, formation toponymique médiévale commune en Normandie occidentale cf. Bricqueville-la-Blouette, Briccavilla 1080, Briquevilla 1200; Bricqueville-sur-Mer, Briquevilla 1022 - 1026[11], plus rare en Normandie orientale, dont le premier élément est Brique- ou Bricque- et le second élément -ville appellatif toponymique répandu notamment en Normandie où il avait généralement le sens de « domaine rural ». L'élément précédent l'appellatif -ville est généralement un anthroponyme et Il semble que les Bricqueville / Briqueville soient typiquement normands, c'est pourquoi Jean Adigard des Gautries préfère avoir recours au nom de personne anglo-scandinave Briki[11], en réalité *Briki, anthroponyme hypothétique qui serait contenu dans certains toponymes danois[12].\n\nLes hameaux en Y-ère/-erie sont des habitats ultérieurs, résultant du développement démographique de la Normandie. Ils désignaient la ferme de la famille Y, fondée sur les nouvelles terres obtenues par les grands défrichements des – siècle. Les essarts prennent le nom des propriétaires qui s'installent sur ces terres, suivi du suffixe -erie ou -ière[13]. Les autres hameaux en Hôtel / Le / Maison…Y sont des constructions encore plus tardives, ils désignent la propriété de la famille Y.\n\nUn Gérard et Bernard d'Opac, les premiers connus de la famille qui donna son nom à la commune, sont cités dans une charte de 1027[14] concernant une donation à l'abbaye de Fécamp[15].\n\nSous l'Ancien Régime, la paroisse dépendait de la généralité de Caen, de l'élection de Coutances (en 1612/1636 et 1677) puis de Saint-Lô (en 1713), et de la sergenterie de Moyon. Depuis 1689, la paroisse accueillait le pèlerinage Saint-Vincent pour les maladies des animaux[15].\n\nEn 1944, le village fut presque entièrement détruit[15].\n\nLe , Le Mesnil-Opac intègre avec Moyon et Chevry la commune de Moyon Villages[16] créée sous le régime juridique des communes nouvelles instauré par la loi 2010-1563 du de réforme des collectivités territoriales. Les communes du Mesnil-Opac, Chevry et Moyon deviennent des communes déléguées. Moyon est le chef-lieu de la commune nouvelle.\n\nLe , le territoire diminue légèrement avec un transfert de territoire vers la commune du Mesnil-Herman par décret du conseil d'État du [17] afin d'obtenir une continuité territoriale entre cette dernière et la commune de Moyon Villages dans le but d'intégrer cette commune nouvelle. La commune du Mesnil-Opac n'est plus alors limitrophe de Saint-Martin-de-Bonfossé.\n\nLe conseil municipal était composé de huit membres (pour onze sièges) dont le maire et trois adjoints[21]. Ces conseillers intègrent au complet le conseil municipal de Moyon-Villages le jusqu'en 2020 et Isabelle Fleury devient maire délégué.\n\nLes élections de 2014 engendre un certain remous au sein de la commune. En effet, à la suite du scrutin national, le maire sortant Michel Desvages est élu conseiller municipal mais battu par Guy Lefranc lors du vote pour le poste de maire. Ce dernier démissionne du poste de maire deux mois plus tard et son adjointe quitte le conseil, ce qui a pour effet de provoquer une nouvelle répartition du nombre de délégués communautaire au sein de Saint-Lô Agglo. Lors des municipales partielles qui se déroulent en octobre, Isabelle Fleury est élue au conseil, avant de remporter, la semaine suivante, l'élection du maire, devant Michel Desvages ; l'ancien maire et deux autres conseillers démissionnent alors du conseil[21].\n\nEn 2021, la commune comptait 246 habitants. Depuis 2004, les enquêtes de recensement dans les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants ont lieu tous les cinq ans (en 2005, 2010, 2015, etc. pour Le Mesnil-Opac[23]) et les chiffres de population municipale légale des autres années sont des estimations[Note 2]. Le Mesnil-Opac a compté jusqu'à 433 habitants en 1841.\n• Église Notre-Dame ( siècle). Détruite en 1944, elle a été reconstruite selon les plans de l'architecte Pierre Sautier.

It is named after the river Yonne, which flows through it, in the country's north-central part. One of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté's eight constituent departments, it is located in its northwestern part, bordering Île-de-France. It was created in 1790 during the French Revolution. Its prefecture is Auxerre, with subprefectures in Avallon and Sens. Its INSEE and postcode number is 89.\n\nYonne is Bourgogne-Franche-Comté's fourth-most populous department, with a population of 335,707 (2019).[3] Its largest city is its prefecture Auxerre, with a population of about 35,000 within city limits and 68,000 in the urban area.\n\nThe first evidence of occupation in this area is found in the Grottes d'Arcy-sur-Cure, where paintings have been found dating back 28,000 years. The Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers of that time also left behind numerous flint artefacts. The area is believed to have been occupied for about 200,000 years.[4] By 4000 BC, a wave of Neolithics arrived from the Danube River region of eastern Europe. They built substantial wooden houses and introduced pottery decorated with the characteristics of the Linear Pottery culture. Further waves of migrants followed, the Chasséen culture, and the Michelsberg culture.[5]\n\nThe Celtic tribe in the area were named \"Icauna\", after the River Yonne which they thought sacred. The region was later occupied by Gallic tribes. In that period, the area came under the control of the Roman Empire, whose chief town was Sens, which they called Agendicum. It was the capital of their province of Gallia Lugdunensis, one of four provinces into which France was divided.[citation needed] The present main roads from Lyon to Boulogne, and from Sens to Alise-Sainte-Reine date from this period. About this time, Auxerre, Tonnerre (Tornodurum) and Avallon were growing in size. In the fourth century, Sens became a walled city. The first bishops were appointed in Sens and Langres, and they influenced the region profoundly because of their power.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1771, the north-westerly part of the present department belonged to Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony, the uncle of Louis XVI of France. The current Yonne department was organized and defined during the French Revolution, on March 4, 1790, as a result of the passing of an Act on December 22, 1789.[6] It was carved out of parts of the provinces of Burgundy, Champagne and Orléans, and to a lesser extent from parts of the Nivernais and Île-de-France.\n\nYonne is a department in central France, one of the eight constituent departments of the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. To the northeast lies the department of Aube, to the east lies Côte-d'Or, to the south lies Nièvre, to the west lies Loiret and to the northwest, the department of Seine-et-Marne. The River Yonne flows northwards through the department. Auxerre, the capital of the department, is situated on the River Yonne, and the River Serein joins this a few kilometres north of the city. The Canal de Bourgogne, which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean, joins the River Yonne through locks at Migennes a little further north. The second biggest town is Sens, situated at the confluence of the rivers Vanne and Yonne.[7]\n\nThe geology of the department is complex with concentric rings of granite, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks, and layers of sedimentary rocks. The terrain is mostly a low-lying plateau used for agriculture. The southwestern part is the Puisaye, which has a higher elevation and is more wooded. To the centre and east, the land inclines to the northwest where the higher land of the Tonnerrois region lies. To the east the rock is mostly limestone. The Auxerrois region is renowned for the grapes grown here, which are used in the production of Chablis wine. To the south lies the mountainous massif of Morvan, the highest parts of which are in the neighbouring department of Nièvre.[7] The department has some forested areas but is mainly used for pasture or cultivated for wheat.[8]\n\nThe most populous commune is Auxerre, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:[3]\n\nOver fifty percent of the inhabitants of the department are engaged in agricultural activities. Yonne is one of the poorest and most rural departments in France. During the hundred years leading up to 1962, its population declined by around 100,000, while all of the surrounding departments experienced population growth. Yonne had been bypassed by the development of the railways. As French industry flourished elsewhere in the late nineteenth century, the young people left Yonne seeking better opportunities, and the department stagnated.[citation needed]\n\nThe viticulture industry was severely affected by the advent of powdery mildew and the arrival of Phylloxera in the nineteenth century; at the same time, the development of the railway network allowed cheaper wines from other regions to undercut Chablis wine in the Paris market. The once-thriving industry never recovered.[11] By 1945, only 4000 hectares of grapevines remained, and only 471 hectares of grapes were grown for Chablis.[8]\n\nMore recently, the population trend has been reversed. During the period 1999 to 2007, it rose by 8000 to a total of 341,418. However, with a population of 46 inhabitants per square kilometre, the density in Yonne is still less than half that for the whole of France, which was 100.5 for the same year.[12]\n\nThe president of the Departmental Council is Patrick Gendraud, elected in 2017. In 2015, the General Council of the department was allotted a budget of 410 million euros.[13]\n\nThe department elects three members of parliament to the National Assembly. In the 2012–17 parliamentary term, two represented the right-wing Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and one the Socialist Party (France) (PS).\n• The medieval construction project of Guédelon Castle as of 2009Yonne (river) - Wikipedia: The Yonne (French: [jɔn] ⓘ) is a river in France, a left-bank tributary of the Seine. It is 292 km (181 mi) long.[1] The river gives its name to the Yonne département. It rises in the Nièvre département, in the Morvan hills near Château-Chinon. It flows into the river Seine at Montereau-Fault-Yonne.\n\nThe Yonne flows through the following départements and towns:\n\nThe main tributaries of the Yonne are the Vanne, the Armançon, the Serein and the Cure.\n\nThe river was historically used for flottage, or the floating of rafts of timber from the Morvan forest to serve the needs of the capital, Paris.[2] It was bypassed as a rafting waterway by the Canal du Nivernais in 1841, from near its source at Corbigny down to Auxerre.\n\nIn 1834 the engineer Charles Poirée had successfully tested his design for a needle weir, and this construction technique was adopted on the river Yonne. The first lock was built in the 1840s, the others from 1861. The locks were enlarged to Freycinet standards in the late 19th century, then again to their current dimensions after World War II.[3]\n\nThe navigable river Yonne extends for 108 km (67 mi), from Auxerre (junction with the Canal du Nivernais) to the confluence with the Seine.

Together they produced works that directly challenged the dictatorship that then ruled Brazil and experimented with photocopy machines and other new technologies. In 1982 the group disbanded, and França relocated to Chicago, where he pursued an MFA in art and technology at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and began working in video. França continued living in Chicago and making videos until he died from an AIDS-related illness in 1991.\n\nThe three videos displayed in this gallery showcase França’s experimentation with technique and form as well as his exploration of narrative and emotion. Fighting the Invisible Enemy is a largely abstract work that combines a discordant soundtrack with flickering images, sometimes of the artist himself. Without Fear of Vertigo uses interviews to allude to an ambiguous narrative of suicide and death. A Prelude to a Death Foretold not only celebrates love and intimacy but also memorializes the many friends França lost to AIDS-related illnesses. As its title suggests, A Prelude to a Death Foretold also foreshadowed the artist’s own passing not long after he completed this work.\n\nThe videos are shown in sequence, repeating every 20 minutes.\n\nPlease be aware that this presentation includes a discussion of suicide.Maroilles cheese - Wikipedia: Cow's-milk cheese made in the regions of Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France\n\nMaroilles (French pronunciation: [maʁwal] ⓘ), also known as Marolles, is a cow's-milk cheese made in the regions of Picardy and Nord-Pas-de-Calais in northern France. It derives its name from the village of Maroilles in the region in which it is still manufactured.\n\nThe cheese is sold in individual rectangular blocks with a moist orange-red washed rind and a strong smell. In its mass-produced form it is around 13 centimetres (5 in) square and 6 centimetres (2 in) in height, weighing around 700 grams (25 oz) In addition, according to its AOC regulations, cheeses eligible for AOC status can be one of three other sizes:\n• Sorbais – (3/4) 12-12.5 cm square, 4 cm high, 550 g in weight. ripening: at least 4 weeks.\n• Mignon – (1/2) 11-11.5 cm square, 3 cm high, 350 g in weight. ripening: at least 3 weeks.\n• Quart – (1/4) 8-8.5 cm square, 3 cm high, 180 g in weight. ripening: at least 2 weeks.\n\nMaroilles is often reported to have first been made in 962 by a monk in the Abbey of Maroilles.[1] The cheese rapidly became famous throughout the region and was a favourite of several French kings including Philip II, Louis IX, Charles VI and Francis I.\n\nThe curd is shaped and salted before being removed from its mould and placed in a ventilated drying area for around ten days during which time a gentle light coating of bacteria develops. The cheese is then brushed and washed and cellared for at least five weeks, though periods of up to four months are not uncommon. During this time, it is turned and brushed at regular intervals to remove the natural white mould to allow its red bacteria to change the rind from yellow to red.\n\nThe finished cheese is a minimum of 45% fat, and is made in both pasteurised and unpasteurised forms. AOC status was granted in 1976 with AOP status following in 1996.[2] In 2005, 2,126 tons were made, of which around 6% came from the 10 fermier producers, with the remainder being made by the three industriel producers.[3]\n\nA number of less-common cheeses are made in northern France using very similar methods and are often listed in the \"Maroilles family\". These include Baguette Laonnaise (made in Laon), Boulette d'Avesnes (Avesnes-sur-Helpe), Boulette de Cambrai (Cambrai), Cœur d'Arras (Arras), Cœur d'Avesnes (Avesnes), Dauphin (Nord), Gris de Lille (Pas-de-Calais), Guerbigny (Picardy), and Rollot (Somme).\n\nThe very successful[4] 2008 French comedy film Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis jokes about the strong smell of Maroilles cheese.Maroilles (queso) - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Maroilles (también conocido como Marolles) es un queso de leche de vaca, elaborado en las regiones de Picardía y Norte-Paso de Calais en el norte de Francia, en los departamentos de Aisne y de Norte. Deriva su nombre de la localidad de Maroilles en la región en la que aún es manufacturado. Es un queso AOC desde 1976 y que ha obtenido DOP por Reglamento (CE) n.º 1107/96.[1]​\n\nSe considera que el primero en elaborar el Maroilles fue en 962 un monje en la Abadía de Maroilles,[2]​ cerca de Lille, en el norte de Francia. La abadía data del siglo VII. En 1174 el abad decretó que las villas de Maroilles y tres más elaboraran queso para él, fijando el 24 de junio como día de fabricación del queso y el 1º de octubre como el de la entrega. Los abades mejoraron el ganado para adecuarlo al clima y a los requerimientos de la producción quesera. El queso se hizo rápidamente famoso por toda la región y era el favorito de varios reyes franceses, entre ellos Felipe II, Luis IX, Carlos VI y Francisco I.\n\nSe hace tanto con leche pasteurizada como no pasteurizada. La cuajada es moldeada y salada antes de ser apartada de su molde y colocada en una zona ventilada para secar durante alrededor de 10 días, tiempo durante el cual se desarrolla una cubierta ligera de bacterias. El queso es entonces frotado y lavado y guardado en bodega durante al menos cinco semanas, pues el queso puede consumirse joven, cuando aún es calcáreo en el centro y con corteza amarga; no es infrecuente, sin embargo, que se tenga durante períodos de cuatro meses. Durante este tiempo, el queso se gira y frota regularmente con lo que la corteza cambia de color de amarillo a naranja y finalmente rojo. Este proceso es muy importante, puesto que el continuo girar del queso favorece el desarrollo de la bacteria que forma la corteza.\n\nEn 2005 se hicieron 2.126 toneladas de las que alrededor del 6% se hicieron por 10 productores fermier, siendo el resto obra de tres productores industriel.[3]​\n\nEl queso acabado tiene un mínimo del 45% de materia grasa. Se vende en bloques rectangulares individuales con una corteza lavada de color naranja-rojizo. En su forma producida masivamente tiene alrededor de 13 centímetros de lado y 6 centímetros de alto. Además, según las normas de la AOC, los quesos aptos para el estatus de AOC tienen que tener uno de estos tres tamaños:\n• Sorbais - (3/4) 12-12,5 cm lado, 4 cm alto, peso de 550 g. Maduración al menos 4 semanas.\n\nLa textura es semisuave. La pasta resulta blanda y aceitosa. Desprende un fuerte olor como de fruta fermentada. El sabor es frutal y ahumado.\n\nLos mejores períodos para hacerlo son mayo-junio y septiembre-octubre. Se recomienda tomarlo con un vino Châteauneuf-du-Pape.\n\nVarios quesos menos comunes se hacen en el norte de Francia usando métodos muy similares y a menudo se les menciona entre la \"familia de los maroilles\". Varían según la forma y el tamaño, pero todos ellos tienen en común la corteza lavada de color rojizo, sin moho. Son quesos pegajosos y ligeramente salados, parecidos: el Pont-l'Évêque y el Livarot (Queso)livarot. Pueden citarse:\n• Avesnes. Tiene un peso de 200 gramos. Está enriquecido con hierbas, clavo y pimienta. Se le da forma y se cubre con paprika.\n• Baguette Laonnaise. Hecho en la región de Picardía, departamento de Aisne, ciudad industrial de Laon. Tiene un 45 % de materia grasa. Se hace en forma de barra o de ladrillo, incluso redondo. Madura a lo largo de dos meses. Su textura es suave, con una pasta elástica y densa. Conforme va madurando, el queso desarrolla un sabor muy picante, especiado, y un final que recuerda a la granja. Se recomienda tomarlo con Coteaux Champenois y Bouzy.\n• Boulette d'Avesnes. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento de Paso de Calais, ciudad de Avesnes. Es un queso fresco con forma de cono. Se caracteriza por su textura especiada. Suave, sabor muy ácido. Inicialmente se hacía con el suero de leche que sobraba de la elaboración del queso o la mantequilla, amasando a mano la cuajada y mezclándola con perejil, pimienta o paprika. Se recomienda tomarlo con un Borgoña Passetoutgrains.\n• Boulette de Cambrai. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento Norte. Es un queso fresco.\n• Cœur d'Arras. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento de Paso de Calais, ciudad de Arras.\n• Cœur d'Avesnes. Hecho en la región de Picardía, departamento de Aisne, ciudad de Avesnes. Es un queso fundido.\n• Dauphin. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento del Norte. Se elabora con leche de cabra. Tiene un 45 % de materia grasa. Es como el Avesnes, pero en forma de delfín, como su nombre indica. Se hace con un Maroilles sazonado con perejil, estragón y pimienta. Madura durante 2-4 meses. La pasta es muy suave y ligeramente pegajosa. Este queso tiene un sabor especiado con olor a levadura. Se recomienda tomarlo con un vino Cotes du Rhone.\n• Gris de Lille. Hecho en la región Norte-Paso de Calais, departamento de Paso de Calais. Tiene un 45% de materia grasa. Se empapa en salmuera durante tres meses. Tiene un sabor salado y fuerte. También se lo conoce como Puant de Lille o Puant Macere. Cuanto más madura, más fuerte es y más al gusto del consumidor local. Su forma es cuadrada, con una corteza pegajosa de color gris rosado. La pasta es suave, ligeramente elástica. Se parece al Maroilles, pero el proceso de maduración es diferente. Marida bien con champán.\n• Guerbigny. Hecho en la región de Picardía, en la localidad del mismo nombre, Guerbigny. Tiene un 45% de materia grasa. Madura durante 5 semanas. Tiene forma de corazón. Su textura resulta suave. Desprende un olor fuerte. El sabor es pegajoso. Se recomienda tomarlo con un vino Sancerre Coteaux Champenois.\n• Rollot. Se hace en Picardía, siendo originario del pueblo de Rollot, en el Somme. Peso medio de 300 g. Forma de corazón.\n\nA nivel nacional, en Francia, el Maroilles es reconocido como appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) desde 1955, luego confirmada por los decretos de 1976 y del 29 de diciembre de 1986.​​[4]​ Desde 1996, es una denominación de origen protegida (PDO) ante la Unión Europea.[5]​​​​​​​​​​ ​A nivel internacional, cuenta con registro como denominación de origen, conforme al Sistema de Lisboa, ante la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, desde el 20 de diciembre de 1967.[6]​\n• Le site de la Maison du Lait (en francés)\n• Le site de France Gourmet (en francés)\n• Maroiles en Tout Un Fromage (en francés)Everything you need to know about Maroilles cheese: Have you ever heard of a Northern French Cheese named Maroilles? It’s been really famous all over the world after the release of a blockbuster called “Welcome to the Sticks” (Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis) in France! This sweet cheese is definitely not as strong as you think it is and you might enjoy tasting it with your coffee during breakfast… Do you doubt it? We can make you a whole different person, you know? Let’s try it!\n\nFind out all about the Ch’ti cheese that arouses both curiosity and taste buds…\n\nWhat type of cheese is it?\n\nMaroilles is a soft, washed-rind cheese from the Northern region of France. It’s a cow’s milk cheese, with a creamy texture and a strong, pronounced taste. Its distinctive orange rind is the result of regular washing of the cheese during ripening, giving it a distinctive, aromatic flavor.\n\nWhere does Maroilles come from?\n\nMaroilles is produced in the Hauts-de-France region, formerly known as Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The origins of Maroilles go back to the Middle Ages, when the monks of Maroilles Abbey developed this cheese from the milk of local cows. Since then, the tradition of making Maroilles has been perpetuated in the region, making it a symbol of local gastronomy.\n\nWhich cheese is similar to Maroilles?\n\nA similar cheese to Maroilles is Munster, from the Alsace region of France. Like Maroilles, Munster is a soft, washed-rind cheese with a robust flavor and creamy texture. While each cheese has its own nuances of flavor, Maroilles lovers will often also appreciate Munster for its similar characteristics. There’s also Limburger, more popular in the US.\n\nUnfortunately, this cheese is not recommended to pregnant women. Maroilles has a washed-rind, which makes it more likely to develop bacteria.\n\nYou can buy Maroilles in our cheese shops when you visit Paris, in lots of cheese shops all around France (even in some supermarkets) and probably in some French cheese dairies in the US. Good luck!\n\nIs it really eaten with coffee in the north of France?\n\nYes, it’s true that in some areas of northern France, notably the (former) Nord-Pas-de-Calais, it’s common to enjoy Maroilles with coffee. This surprising combination of flavors, combining the intensity of the cheese with the richness and bitterness of the coffee, is appreciated by many locals. It’s a local tradition, a testament to culinary daring and a love of regional produce.\n\nOur 5 best recipes with Maroilles (made in Paroles de Fromagers)\n\nLet’s move on to our top 5 original recipes featuring Maroilles, including the famous Maroilles tart.\n• Melt the butter in a frying pan and sauté the sliced onion until golden and caramelized.\n• Place the shortcrust pastry in a tart tin and prick the base with a fork.\n• Arrange the slices of Maroilles on the base of the tart, then spread the caramelized onions on top.\n• In a bowl, beat the eggs with the crème fraîche, then season with salt and pepper.\n• Pour the egg and cream mixture over the onions and maroilles.\n• Bake the flamiche for 30-35 minutes, until the crust is golden and the filling is set.\n• Leave to cool for a few minutes before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n• Season chicken fillets with salt and pepper on both sides.\n• In a large skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat. Add chicken fillets and cook on each side until golden and cooked through, about 5-6 minutes per side, depending on thickness. Remove from the pan and set aside.\n• In the same pan, add a little more butter if necessary, then add the sliced mushrooms. Sauté until golden and tender, about 5 minutes. Add the minced onion and chopped garlic, then continue to cook for a further 2-3 minutes until tender and fragrant.\n• Reduce the heat to medium-low, then add the diced Maroilles and crème fraîche to the pan.

At one point during the game, he grabbed Draymond Green's leg and was stomped on the chest by Green afterwards. As a result, Sabonis was assessed with a technical foul.[152] The Kings were eliminated in seven games.\n\nOn July 2, 2023, Sabonis and the Kings terminated the remaining one-season contract worth $19.4 million and signed a five-year contract extension worth $217 million.[153] This is the most profitable contract in Lithuania's sport history.[154]\n\nOn December 18, Sabonis logged the 35th triple-double of his career with 28 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 143–131 win over the Washington Wizards.[155] On January 3, 2024, Sabonis recorded a triple-double with 22 points, a then season-high 23 rebounds and 12 assists in a 138–135 double overtime win over the Orlando Magic.[156] On January 29, 2024, Sabonis scored 20 points on 10-of-11 shooting from the field, grabbed a career-high 26 rebounds and delivered 5 assists in a 103–94 win against the Memphis Grizzlies.

The other was Wilt Chamberlain, who did it six times.[157]\n\nOn February 13, Sabonis posted his 50th career triple-double with 35 points, 18 rebounds, 12 assists and 3 blocks in 130–125 loss against the Phoenix Suns.[158] On March 12, Sabonis recorded his 47th consecutive double-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists in a 129–94 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

However, Davies' children gave their blessing for Sabonis to use the retired number.[162] On October 26, Sabonis posted his 59th career triple-double with 29 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists in 131–127 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.

He grabbed a tournament-high 27 rebounds against Poland on July 27. In 2013, at 17 years of age, Sabonis played for the Lithuania U-18 team in 2013 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. He averaged 14 points, 11.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game[169] and was tournament leader in rebounds per game.[170] While playing against Serbia, he scored 22 points, grabbed 22 rebounds and dished out 3 assists. Lithuania won the game 74–70 in OT.[171] In 2014, coach Jonas Kazlauskas included Sabonis on the preliminary list for the Lithuania men's national basketball team.[172] In 2014, D.Sabonis played in the FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship for the second time. This time he averaged 15.9 points, 12.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.[173][174] On July 9, 2015, he was invited to join the Lithuania men's national team training camp for the first time.[175] On July 15, by participating in 2015 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship, Sabonis achieved the tournament rebounds record by grabbing 28 against Ukraine.[176] He led the tournament at 13.2 rebounds per game.[177]\n\nOn July 29, 2015, Sabonis debuted for the Lithuania men's national team in a game against Australia, scoring 4 points and grabbing 7 rebounds.[178] Sabonis was the youngest player ever to play for the national team, beating Jonas Valančiūnas by a matter of days.[179] Sabonis averaged 6 points and 5.9 rebounds during the preparation games phase, and was the team's second best rebounder after Valančiūnas.[180] Sabonis played for Lithuania at EuroBasket 2015, winning a silver medal in his debut year.[181] He also was a member of the Lithuanian Olympic national team during the 2016 Summer Olympics, where he averaged 5.5 points and 4.5 rebounds.[182]\n\nSabonis married Shashana Rosen on August 15, 2021, in Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, France; the wedding was officiated by a rabbi.[183] They welcomed their first child, a son named Tiger, on March 11, 2022, and were expecting a second child in summer 2023.[184] The family keeps Shabbat and eats only kosher food.[183] In April 2023, his wife announced that Sabonis was in the process of converting to Judaism.[183] Sabonis and his wife launched a wine brand in November 2024, dubbed Ones by Sabonis.[185]\n• List of European basketball players in the United StatesDomantas Sabonis - Ala pivot de Sacramento Kings: Celtics y Cavs ganaron con autoridad en el día de Martin Luther KingRCD Espanyol - Wikipedia: Reial Club Deportiu Espanyol de Barcelona (Catalan: [rəˈjal ˈklub dəpuɾˈtiw əspəˈɲɔl də βəɾsəˈlonə]; \"Royal Spanish Sports Club of Barcelona\"), commonly known as RCD Espanyol, is a Spanish professional sports club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\n\nFounded in 1900 in Barcelona, Espanyol currently play their home games just outside the city at the RCDE Stadium, which holds up to 40,000 spectators. Domestically, Espanyol has won the Copa del Rey four times, most recently in 2006. In international competitions, the club reached the UEFA Cup final in 1988 and 2007. It has a long-standing rivalry with FC Barcelona.\n\nInitially known as the Sociedad Española de Football on its foundation, the name was changed to Club Español de Fútbol in 1901. In 1906, the club folded due to financial reasons and most of the players joined the X Sporting Club, which came to win the Campionat de Catalunya three times in a row before disappearing in 1908 to merge with the Spanish Jiu-Jitsu Club to be effectively relaunched as the Club Deportivo Español, and in 1910, they adopted their present-day colours. Espanyol is one of several Spanish football clubs granted patronage by the Spanish crown and thus entitled to use Real in their names and the royal crown on their badge. This right was granted to Espanyol in 1912 by Alfonso XIII and the club subsequently became known as the Real Club Deportivo Español.[2]\n\nFollowing the abdication of the same king in 1931 and the declaration of the Second Spanish Republic, due to prohibition of royal symbols, the club adopted the more Catalan/republican friendly name, Club Esportiu Espanyol. After the Spanish Civil War, the name was reverted.\n\nThe club took the Catalan spelling for its name in February 1995. The word \"Deportiu\" in Reial Club Deportiu Espanyol de Barcelona is a Catalanised form of the original word \"Deportivo\" (Castilian), despite the correct word being \"Esportiu\" in the Catalan language. This choice was made in order to retain the initials \"RCD\" in the club's name.\n\nEspanyol was founded on 25 October 1900 by Ángel Rodríguez Ruiz, an engineering student at the University of Mariquitas.[3] The club's original home was in the well-off district of Sarrià; Espanyol was the first club in Spain to be formed exclusively by Spanish fans of the game, with the other early clubs having links to Britain or central Europe.\n\nA friend of the club founder owned a textile business and happened to have an abundance of yellow material left over from a job. In 1910, the club changed its name to the Club Deportivo Español and at the proposal of Eduardo Corrons, the club's number one partner for many years, the club agreed to choose blue and white stripes as shirt colours and as the central colours of the club badge.[4] Blue and white were chosen in homage to the colours appearing on the shield of the great Sicilian-Aragonese Admiral Roger de Lluria, who sailed the Mediterranean protecting the interests of the Crown of Aragon in the Middle Ages.[4] The club was successful from the very beginning, winning the first Campionat de Catalunya in 1903 and subsequently playing in the first Copa del Rey in 1903.[5]\n\nIn 1906 Club Español de Football had to suspend its activities due to a lack of players, since most of them were university students who enrolled to study at universities outside Catalonia. X Sporting Club took advantage of this as most of the remaining Español players joined them, which meant a big leap in quality for the club, and as a result, the X won the Catalan championship three times in a row between 1905 and 1908, beating the likes of FC Internacional and FC Barcelona for the title.[6] This historic side had the likes of Pedro Gibert, José Irízar and Santiago Massana. It was not until 1909 that X and Español were restructured again, when several of the former university students returned to Barcelona with the idea of refounding Club Español de Football, which they achieved on 27 December 1908, when X merged with the Spanish Jiu-Jitsu Club.[6]\n\nIn the 1910s, they won the Campionat de Catalunya three times, in 1911–12, 1914–15 and 1917–18, winning later largely thanks to their backline led by Ricardo Zamora. They also reached the final of the Copa del Rey twice in 1911 and 1915, but lost to Athletic Bilbao on both occasions.[7]\n\nIn 1994, Espanyol created its reserve team, Espanyol B,[8] currently playing in the Segunda División B.\n\nJavier Clemente was hired in 1986. In his first season, he took the team to a joint-best 3rd place, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. They defeated Borussia Mönchengladbach, A.C. Milan, Inter Milan, TJ Vitkovice and Club Brugge KV to reach the final, losing on penalties to Bayer 04 Leverkusen after a 3–3 aggregate draw.[9] Two relegations followed, but the club remained in La Liga from winning the 1993–94 Segunda División until relegated at the conclusion of the 2019-20 COVID pandemic impacted season.\n\nJuli Pardo oversaw the transformation of the club into a Sociedad Anónima Deportiva.[10] In the wake of the accumulated debt, the club were forced to sell the Sarrià Stadium, which was eventually demolished in 1997.[10]\n\nPaco Flores' Espanyol won the 2000 Copa del Rey Final 2–1 against Atlético Madrid at Mestalla, a first cup win since 1940.[11] Six years later, under Miguel Ángel Lotina, the club won again, this time 4–1 against Real Zaragoza in Madrid, with goals by Raúl Tamudo, Luis García (two) and Coro.[12]\n\nWith this cup win, Espanyol entered the UEFA Cup. They won all their group games, before dispatching Livorno, Maccabi Haifa, Benfica, and Werder Bremen to reach the final. In the final, held on 16 May at Hampden Park in Glasgow, Espanyol fell to fellow La Liga side Sevilla, losing 3–1 in a shootout following a 2–2 draw.[13] They became the only football team in UEFA Cup history to remain unbeaten in the tournament, yet not take home the trophy. Walter Pandiani, who would leave the club at the end of the season, was the UEFA Cup's top goalscorer that season. On 9 June 2007, Tamudo became Espanyol's highest-ever goalscorer after surpassing the 111 goals scored by Rafael Marañón, and ended the night with 113.\n\nOn 31 May 2009, Espanyol played its last match at the Estadio Olímpico de Montjuic, a 3–0 defeat of Málaga. Espanyol had played in the Estadi Olímpic after moving from their previous ground in Sarria. With the move, club talisman Raúl Tamudo had the unique distinction of having played in three different home stadiums with his club: Sarrià, Montjuïc and, beginning in the 2009–10 season, the Cornellà-El Prat.\n\nIn January 2009, former Espanyol defender Mauricio Pochettino was hired as manager with the club in the relegation zone – his first senior job.[14] He won 2–1 against rivals Barcelona at the Camp Nou in February to help keep the club up; Barcelona, under Pep Guardiola, won the treble that season.[15]\n\nAfter 12 seasons playing at the Estadi Olímpic de Montjuïc, Espanyol moved to the Estadi de Cornellá-El Prat. The new stadium was officially inaugurated on 2 August 2009 with a match between Espanyol and Liverpool; Espanyol won 3–0, with Luis García scoring the first goal at the ground, followed by a Ben Sahar double.[16] Six days later, Espanyol captain Daniel Jarque died from a cardiac arrest aged 26 in the Florence neighbourhood of Coverciano, where the club was at the time after playing several fixtures in Italy.[17] Since then, in the 21st minute – his former shirt number – of every Espanyol match, an ovation is made in his honour for a full minute.\n\nAfter Pochettino left in 2012, the club maintained themselves in the top flight under a series of other managers. In January 2016, Chinese businessman Chen Yansheng took over the club by acquiring a 54% stake.[18] In the 2018–19 season, Espanyol finished 7th, thus returning to the Europa League for the first time since their final run in 2006–07.[19] However, the club suffered relegation for the first time since 1994 the following season, after a 1–0 loss at Barcelona.[20][21] On 3 August 2020 the club published an official statement urging La Liga to suspend relegation; nevertheless relegation was not avoided.[22] Espanyol won promotion back to La Liga at the first attempt on 8 May 2021 following a 0–0 draw against Zaragoza, with four matches to spare in the 42-game season.\n\nSince 2022, Espanyol has achieved a strategic cooperation with LEYU SPORTS. And LEYU became Official Asian Partner of RCDE.[23] On 28 May 2023, Espanyol relegated to the Segunda División after two seasons in La Liga. Following a 4th Place finish in the Segunda División, the club was promoted back to La Liga following a promotion 2-0 (2-1 agg.) win against Real Oviedo on 23 June 2024.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century during the Miguel Primo de Rivera dictatorship (1923–1930), FC Barcelona was seen as a symbol of Catalan identity. This contrasted with RCD Espanyol which cultivated a kind of compliance with the central authority.[24]\n\nIn 1918, the municipalities of Catalonia promoted a campaign to ask the Spanish Government for a Statute of Autonomy. FC Barcelona joined that request and the Catalan press recognised FC Barcelona as a major cultural arm of the Catalan independence movement. The city's other team, RCD Espanyol, dissociated itself from the claim due to the former's success on the European stage.[25][26]\n\nToday FC Barcelona is the club that is closer to the political powers in Catalonia. Its last presidents have linked the club with the Catalan independence movement and the holding of a referendum, even though this causes discomfort among some Catalan fans and those in the rest of Spain who feel neglected and think the team is biased against them.[27] Although some of RCD Espanyol's directors have expressed pro-independence stances, the club stays out of politics. It is believed that most of the team's fans are against the independence of Catalonia.[28]\n\nOn numerous occasions RCD Espanyol has complained of unfavourable and sometimes directly offensive treatment towards the club in favour of FC Barcelona by some Catalonian public media like TV3.[29][30][31]\n\nDespite these differences in ideology, the derbi (derby) has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than those of Barcelona (who hold El Clásico in higher regard instead) due to the difference in objectives.\n\nThough it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant. In the league table, Espanyol has only managed to finish above Barça on three occasions in almost 70 years and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 victory in 1951.\n\nEspanyol achieved a 2–1 win against FC Barcelona during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season.[32]\n\nEspanyol lost 0–1 to FC Barcelona on 8 July 2020, to be relegated to the Segunda División.[20][21]\n\nFrom 1923 until 1997, Espanyol played their home games in Estadi de Sarrià in the Sarrià-Sant Gervasi district of Barcelona. In 1997, they moved to the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys on Montjuïc. For the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Espanyol moved into the newly constructed RCDE Stadium (also known as Estadi Cornellà-El Prat) between Cornellà de Llobregat and El Prat de Llobregat.\n• In 1928, Espanyol became a founding member of La Liga, and in 1929, the team won their first Copa del Rey. Espanyol has completed the highest number of seasons in La Liga without winning the title.\n• The team has qualified for the UEFA Cup/Europa League eight times (including the qualifications following their 2000 and 2006 Spanish Cup wins, which in earlier eras would instead have granted entry to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup) and reached the final in 1988, 33 34 35 36 losing to Bayer Leverkusen of then-West Germany on penalty kicks (3–2), after a two-legged final of contrasts ended level (3–0 in Barcelona, 0–3 in Leverkusen) 37 38 and in 2007, losing to compatriots Sevilla, again on penalties (3–1) after a memorable match at Hampden Park, Glasgow ended 1–1 after normal time, and 2–2 after extra time.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

In March 2017, the Association of Supporters and Shareholders of RCD Espanyol boosted a project for recovering the sporting sections of the club, but this time without any economic link with the football team. The new multi-sports club was created with the name of Seccions Deportives Espanyol (Sporting sections Espanyol).[47]\n\nTwo months later, the association confirmed that Espanyol would start competing in the 2017–18 season, with a roller hockey team and women's volleyball teams.[48] In the next season, the basketball section was refounded and a new section of handball would be created.Girona FC And RCD Espanyol, LALIGA’s Other Catalan Clubs: FC Barcelona casts a big shadow. Barça’s style of play, trophy cabinet and star players, like Messi, Cryuff and now Gavi, often overshadow those of all other clubs in Spain besides Real Madrid. The Catalan giants have a global footprint few clubs can compete with, making life in their vicinity very difficult for anyone. Regional rivals Girona FC, and crosstown rivals RCD Espanyol understand they will seldom reach the sporting heights or popularity that Barça does and thus are finding other ways to bring their own identities and flavor to Spanish soccer’s top two divisions.\n\nFans paying attention to this year’s competition will note that RCD Espanyol is absent from the standings. Unfortunately for the club in Cornellà - a municipality neighboring Barcelona proper - relegation from LALIGA last season means Spain’s top division only has two Catalan clubs this season. Still, the second division club continues to bring fans through the doors as it fights to regain its place amongst Spain’s elite. At the other end of the spectrum, Girona FC goes into gameweek thirteen top of the LALIGA standings with 31 points and more goals scored than any other club in the competition. So, what more should fans know about the Catalan clubs that exist in Barcelona’s shadow, and what does the future hold for them?\n\nReal Club Deportivo Espanyol is a founding member of LALIGA. Created by students from the University of Barcelona back in 1900, Los Pericos (The Parakeets) are 123 years-old and have spent 87 seasons in Spain’s top division. Los Blanquiazules (The Blue and Whites) are four time winners of Spain’s Copa del Rey and were once home to LALIGA icons Ricardo Zamora, Alfredo Di Stefano, Raúl Tamudo and Mauricio Pochettino. Espanyol also holds an unbreakable record: it was the first club to score a LALIGA goal. Winger Pitus Prat netted the goal on February 10th 1929 against Real Unión de Irún.\n\nHaving wandered from the quiet, village-like neighborhood of Sàrria - to the top of Montjuïc - where Barcelona currently plays - in search of a permanent home, in 2009 Los Pericos finally settled in at Stage Front Stadium on the outskirts of the city. The state-of-the-art facility seats 40,000 spectators and is in contention to be one of the host venues for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Espanyol was also one of the first European clubs to realize the benefits of environmental sustainability, equipping the stadium with over 2,700 solar panels on its roof, and a sustainable water recycling system to improve energy efficiency and reduce hydro waste.\n\nDirector of Communications, Sergio Aguilar, says that while the club always seeks to win on the field, it looks for ways to win off of it as well. Making a mark in the community and developing a strong relationship with fans is deeply important to a club that knows titles and superstars come few and far between. This is why Espanyol is consistently collaborating with local, national and international organizations to create positive social impact. As one club official puts it, “we want to be a purpose-driven company and create a sense of pride in being an Espanyol fan.”\n\nThis season the club has already won plaudits from around the world for its cute and innovative project, Els Perics No Abandonen (The Parakeets Don’t Abandon), which saw players walking out before the game with rescue puppies in their arms. The project is part of the club’s wider Superliga Solidaria (Superleague of Solidarity) charitable initiative which encourages inter-club collaboration and seeks to “allocate resources to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in society.” In this instance, the club was highlighting animal abandonment, a growing problem in Spain, where in 2022 over 290,000 pets were abandoned or given to shelters.\n\nSuperliga Solidaria is born from the club’s joint response - alongside the Catalan association “Es Per Tu” - to the invasion of Ukraine. Seeing the suffering of the Ukrainian people, the joint partnership sent the official team bus to Poland full of food, first aid materials and medicine. The goods were distributed to those in need in Ukraine and the bus was used to transport war-affected Ukrainian children to safe haven in Spain. Seeing the impact of its efforts, Espanyol decided to continue using its social platform to promote and support social causes.\n\nPutting its money where its mouth is, Espanyol is committing 5% of the value of each season ticket sold towards Superliga Solidaria. Through the project, Los Blanquiazules have collaborated with over 200 organizations, including other LALIGA clubs such as Real Betis, Athletic Club and Girona FC. The club has helped organize food drives, it sent food and necessities to Türkiye and Syria after the devastating earthquake and it has helped distribute information to help local businesses get much-needed financial aid in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moving forward, Espanyol hopes to increase its efforts and visibility and will do so with the help of its volunteer network - created in 2015, which serves to strengthen the relationship between the club and its supporters and get fans involved in the club’s social work.\n\nOn the field, Espanyol is battling to return to the first division with a budget that has been slashed in half due to relegation. At the time of writing, the team is in 5th place in the standings, but the head coach was just let go. Despite the uncertainty on field, stadium attendance has increased this season as fans continue to buy into the club’s greater sense of purpose. Espanyol knows that life in the first division will allow it to attract a wider audience and share its brand with the world. It is seeking to become LALIGA’s third Catalan club in the top flight next season but will brave the ups and downs of professional soccer maintaining its local essence and focus on social causes.\n\nUnlike its big-city neighbors Espanyol and Barcelona, Girona does not have a storied history in LALIGA. Founded in 1930 out of necessity after the popular UE Girona dissolved due to insolvency, the club has been a perennial battler in the lower divisions of Spanish soccer. In fact, it was not until 2017 - after three failed attempts in a row - that the Gironistes reached LALIGA. Despite momentary glory, the club was relegated to the second division on the last day of the 2018-19 season and has had to fight its way back to the top.\n\nCEO Ignasi Mas-Bagà calls Girona a stubborn, persistent club that focuses on hard work, and the pursuit of excellence. Despite hailing from the capital city of the province (also named Girona), the club is a small fish in LALIGA’s rough waters. But Mas-Bagà insists this is a positive. Girona FC has capitalized on its lack of size to grow extremely close to its fanbase, providing it an authentic matchday experience. The CEO notes that watching a game at Estadi Montilivi - the smallest stadium in LALIGA, capacity 14,624 - is unlike going anywhere else in Spain. Fans can hear the ball being kicked, and can often even hear the players yelling to each other, or the orders being handed down by the coaches, such is the proximity to the field.\n\nFor all the glitz and glamor of elite level soccer, a day at Montilivi can remind fans of the simplicity of the game - twenty-two players running around with a ball at their feet, being spurred on by a fervent home crowd. And the players understand the club ethos, often staying on the field after the game to sign autographs and take pictures with their adoring fans.\n\nThe club is currently enjoying its moment in the sun. Girona is in first place after twelve games and producing some of the most exciting soccer in the division despite having the thirteenth highest salary budget in the league. But people around the club are remaining calm. The objective at the outset of the season was to remain in the league and thereby help consolidate the club’s economic and sporting future. So far, the club looks set to do that and more, but Ignasi makes it clear that while there is an aspiration to compete in Europe and win titles, the club has a long-term plan and is not obsessed with winning at all costs right now.\n\nPart of the reason Girona FC - a club from a charming, albeit small, city, better known for Michelin stars than soccer stars - can take a long-term approach in the cutthroat world of sports is thanks to City Football Group (CFG). On August 23rd, 2017, CFG invested in Girona FC, and has since become the club’s majority shareholder. CFG is funded by the royal family of the United Arab Emirates and has an extensive portfolio of sports investments, most notably reigning Premier League and UEFA Champions League champions Manchester City. Ignasi admits that CFG has brought stability, necessary investment and the know-how to help implement a long-term vision, but insists that the day-to-day management of the club is done by his team on the ground. And while it is tempting to think that Girona’s success is down to huge sums of money, the club’s net spend on players is only $3.2 million since CFG acquired its portion of the club in 2017.\n\nHowever, the stability CFG has brought has been pivotal for Girona’s growth as a club. Mas-Bagà, who took the reins as CEO in 2015, says he inherited a club that had no club shop, sold only 800 jerseys a season and had one of the oldest fanbases in the country. Instead of competing with the likes of Barcelona, Ignasi understood that fans could enjoy supporting both Catalan clubs. Through targeted social media campaigns, great matchday experiences and an exciting style of play, the club has been able to capture the attention of the next generation of fans. Now the club sells nearly 11,000 shirts a season, generating over 1 million euros on jersey sales alone. But what makes Girona’s CEO most happy is seeing young kids heading to school in their Girona jerseys: proof of the club’s appeal.\n\nGirona’s transformation is also thanks to its daring attitude. Coach Michel has the team playing swashbuckling soccer that creates good goal-scoring opportunities which the players are currently finishing. In the boardroom, Ignasi says his staff is equally daring. Filled with young, hungry professionals who have local ties, the team looks to challenge an industry that Mas-Bagà admits can be quite old school at times. The club has seized opportunities to sign sponsorship deals with local businesses and leverages the CFG network, providing package deals to companies who may want ties in Catalonia and other places within the company portfolio, like Manchester, New York, Abu Dhabi or Mumbai.\n\nLike Espanyol, Girona has also recognized the value of social impact through soccer. Locally, club players and staff members enter into schools in tougher neighborhoods to help educate children through soccer. The Red and Whites also use their platform to support the local NGO Open Arms, which helps rescue refugees abandoned in international waters off the coast of Spain.\n\nRegardless of the success on the field, the club continues to emphasize sustained economic and sporting growth. It is looking to expand its influence on social media and is finalizing a new 57-acre training complex just outside the city. The club expects its first team will be training there by the end of this season and hopes to move all academy and staff members to the Vilablareix complex by the end of 2025, or early 2026. After that the club will begin renovating Estadi Montilivi, which it hopes to increase to 20,000 capacity.\n\nLife in the shadow of one of the greatest clubs on Earth must be tough, but Espanyol and Girona both show the personality to step out of that shadow each weekend. Whether it is for sporting or social reasons, fans who neglect to watch these two pillars of the Spanish soccer community are missing out.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.Top 10 jugadores de la NBA en la actualidad: LaLiga, Bundesliga, MLB, UFC, Boxeo y miles de eventos en vivo, series originales exclusivas y mucho más. Suscríbete aquí\n\nFinalizada la temporada de NBA, hoy voy a contarles cuál es para mí el top 10 de jugadores en la actualidad. Como parámetro, no voy a usar estadísticas ni números que justifiquen. Voy a centrarme en el impacto que tienen y que tendrán en sus equipos para ganar.\n\nEl más picante de los escoltas de la nueva generación. Devin Booker va camino a ser el líder de los Phoenix Suns por su contracción al trabajo y su talento, pero por sobre todas las cosas por su coraje en momentos importantes. Cierra el top 10 y es justicia.\n\nEl Rey dio un paso atrás para que el resto se luzca y eso fue un acierto clave para que Los Angeles Lakers lleguen donde llegaron. LeBron James está noveno en la lista porque ya tiene 38 años y su carrera entró en el epílogo. Reúne máximo respeto: para quien escribe, es el segundo mejor de la historia detrás de Michael Jordan.\n\nKevin Durant solo está octavo porque tiene 34 años y su salud siempre pende de un hilo. Más allá del paso del tiempo, no existe un 'killer' como KD en la NBA. Un jugador que rompió el molde, uno de los mejores talentos ofensivos de la historia. ¿El problema? El tiempo pasa para todos.\n\nLuka Doncic supo estar más arriba en las consideraciones, pero la pasada temporada jugó por debajo de las expectativas. El cierre de los Dallas Mavericks en temporada regular tampoco ayudó y repercutió en lo que pensamos de él. Tiene solo 24 años. Es un genio del básquetbol, pero debe jugar más y quejarse menos.\n\n¿Tan abajo el MVP de serie regular? Yo creo que sí. La razón es que la primera parte de la temporada es algo muy distinto a los playoffs. El centro camerunés Joel Embiid es un gran jugador, pero tengo serias dudas que pueda llevar a un equipo al campeonato. Equivocado o no, solo el tiempo nos traerá esa respuesta.\n\nSi Marcus Smart es el corazón de los Boston Celtics, Jayson Tatum es el pincel. El arte hecho jugador, la calidad como método de triunfo. Revirtieron un fatídico 0-3 ante el Miami Heat y su lesión en el tobillo le impidió a Boston tener la chance de pelear el séptimo y hacer historia. Boston sin Tatum es un equipo del montón. Tan simple como eso.\n\nEl corazón del Heat y por gran parte de la postemporada que pasó, el máximo atractivo para todos. El espíritu de Jimmy Buckets es incomparable. La mente de acero que aún queda en la NBA. Miami fue un gran equipo, pero fue la determinación de Jimmy Butler la que llevó a un equipo de play-in a jugar las Finales de la NBA.\n\nEl mejor tirador de la historia sigue teniendo, a los 35 años, un impacto crucial en los Golden State Warriors. Es cierto, pudieron hacer un poco más ante los Lakers, pero Golden State llegó hasta ahí por el nivel de Steph Curry. Siempre movedizo, certero como nadie, es Top 10 de la historia. Sin dudas.\n\nPuede ser el mejor, pero el fracaso ante el Heat en primera ronda de playoffs (sí, fue un fracaso más allá de su lesión) lo empuja al segundo lugar. Físicamente, Giannis Antetokounmpo es superior a todo lo conocido. Y más allá del flagelo del tiro a distancia, domina el juego tanto en ataque como en defensa. Tendrá pronto una nueva chance.\n\nDespués de lo que vimos en las Finales de la NBA, no creo que haya nadie que pueda competirle al Gran Hermano del básquetbol, Nikola Jokic. El panóptico que ve todo desde la cima de la montaña. Máximo responsable del primer título de los Denver Nuggets en su historia. Hace felices a todos.\n\nMe hubiese gustado darle un lugar a Ja Morant en esta lista, pero resulta imposible poner como bueno a alguien que tiene que empezar a respetarse a sí mismo, a sus compañeros y a la Liga. La sanción de 25 partidos que le dio la NBA es liviana. Es ahora o nunca: no habrá cuarta oportunidad para él.\n\nHe aquí la lista de jugadores que podrían haber estado en el Top 10, pero que, en mi opinión, quedaron centímetros más abajo:Kobe Bryant: el legendario jugador de baloncesto de la NBA y una de sus hijas mueren en un accidente de helicóptero en California: Kobe Bryant: el legendario jugador de baloncesto de la NBA y una de sus hijas mueren en un accidente de helicóptero en CaliforniaFue elegido como el mejor jugador de básquet callejero de la historia y se dio el lujo de decirle que no a la NBA: “Ganaba más dinero vendiendo drogas”: Si en Argentina el fútbol nació en los potreros, en Estados Unidos el básquet nació en los playgrounds. Piso de cemento, dos aros generalmente con redes con cadenas, líneas pintadas y una pelota. Todo al aire libre a la vista de todos. En esas canchitas de barrio tan típicas de aquel país, ecosistema de tantos jóvenes, este deporte se desarrolló en su esencia más pura y llegó a niveles míticos por el talento innato que brota de sus urbes. Justamente allí, en las calles, el juego creció a la par de su popularidad, en especial entre los afroamericanos, protagonistas de picados que convocaban a miles de personas y quedaron en la memoria colectiva de aquellos ciudadanos de a pie que se convocaban, sin pagar un peso, lo más cerca posible de los límites del campo juego para ver a esos talentosos que despertaban admiración.\n\nAntes de que el básquet llegara a los estadios y se organizaran competencias millonarias, el show estuvo en la calle. Allí nacieron estrellas que aun hoy son mitos vivientes, algunas de las cuales ni siquiera jugaron en las ligas profesionales -casi como siguiendo un guión de Hollywood- pero tuvieron épicos duelos con las estrellas en esos playgrounds y todavía hoy viven en el imaginario colectivo de mucha gente. Con ellos crecieron famosas historias de actuaciones y partidos que hoy se recuerdan como anécdotas únicas que se trasladan de generación en generación. Y tal vez, en ese mundo tan especial, no haya figura más recordada -y venerada- que Joe Hammond, un flaquito sin pinta de crack que es considerado el mejor jugador callejero de básquet que nunca jugó profesionalmente. Autor de las hazañas más grandes en Rucker Park, el potrero más famoso del mundo, ubicado en la intersección de la calle 155 y la avenida 8 en el barrio de Harlem, Nueva York. La casa de las leyendas más grandes, cada una con apodos llamativos que han trascendido en el tiempo, como Earl “The Pearl” Manigault, Wilt “The Stilt” Chamberlain, Julius “Dr. J” Erving, Connie “The Hawk” Hawkins, Herman “Helicopter” Knowlings, “Pee Wee” Kirkland y “Fly” Williams.\n\nHablamos de alguien tan talentoso que fue capaz de llegar al segundo tiempo del partido callejero más importante de siempre y anotar 50 puntos en la cara del mismísimo Doctor J. Alguien que fue elegido en el Draft nada menos que por los Lakers, pero se dio el lujo de rechazar la oferta de la NBA porque “ganaba más dinero en la calle”, jugando y vendiendo drogas… En esta nota, la historia de The Destroyer -El Destructor-, un mito viviente, el mismo al que New York Times eligió en 1990 como el mejor jugador callejero de la historia…\n\nNo hubo un anotador como Hammond. Era flaquito, no parecía fuerte y media poco más de 1m90, pero sus piernas le permitían volar hacia el aro y tenía una característica: le gustaba tirar con tablero. Una vez, todos recuerdan, logró el récord de puntos en Rucker, con 73. Y poco después, en otra actuación cautivante, se dispuso a romperlo y lo hizo, llegando a 74. Kevin Durant, para muchos el mejor jugador ofensivo de la historia, fue una vez a esa canchita y le salieron todas. Así y todo llegó a 66, quedando a ocho de la marca de Joe. Hay demasiadas historias de cómo Hammond mandó a la escuela a varias figuras nacionales. Richie Adams, estrella de la Universidad de Las Vegas, confesó que, cuando tenía 19 años y estaba en su plenitud de juego, fue a Rucker y recibió una paliza de Hammond, que tenía 14 años más. “Ni me conocía y me pregunto si jugaba al básquet. Cuando le dije que sí, me invito a traer mi equipo. Fui con Gary Springer (figura de Iona) y no olvidaré jamás aquella lección”, reconoció.\n\nPero la historia más famosa fue aquella que sucedió en julio de 1971. Rucker se vistió de fiesta para el duelo más esperado de la historia. Cuentan los que estuvieron que había gente hasta donde daba la vista: subidos a los árboles y postes de luz, colgados de las cercas, subidos a los techos y observando con binoculares desde las ventanas de edificios cercanos. Pee Wee Kirkland, otro talento que era el compañero de Hammond en las hazañas en Rucker con el equipo llamado los Milbank Pros, había desafiado a una estrella NBA, Charlie Scott. “Si sos tan bueno, trae a tu equipo y vení a jugar a Rucker”, le dijo. Scott llevó a sus Westsiders, como llamaban a su banda, que tenía, entre otros, a Julius Erving, la famosa figura de la NCAA que tenía destino de superestrella -meses después promediaría 27.3 puntos y 15.7 rebotes en su primera temporada en la ABA, la liga que competía con la NBA- y, con el tiempo, también se convertiría en un mito de Rucker.\n\nLa expectativa fue creciendo con el correr de los días hasta transformarse en el único tema de charla en Harlem y sus alrededores. “Todos me preguntaban cómo me iría contra Julius y yo les decía que deberían preguntarme como le va a ir a él contra mí. Joe, incluso, ni siquiera quería jugar. Me lo dijo…”, contó Bob McCullough, otra figura callejera que luego sería el comisionado de Rucker.\n\nAllí comienza una leyenda que, para algunos, fue creciendo con el correr de los años. Las dudas sobre si Hammond asistiría se confirmaron cuando el partido comenzó sin él mientras las 6000 personas se preguntaban qué le habría sucedido... Los Westsiders, con Kirkland y Erving manejando las acciones, sacaron ventaja de 12 para el entretiempo... “De repente, cuando estábamos por comenzar el segundo tiempo, escuchamos un ‘haaaaaaa”, la marea de gente se abrió como el Mar Rojo y vimos ingresar a Joe desde la entrada del costado”, recordó McCullough. Hammond, quien dicen bajó de una limusina blanca, insistió que no fue una acción calculada -aunque pareció-, que solo se había equivocado de hora porque, básicamente, estaba muy ocupado jugando a los dados. Lo cierto es que su tardía llegada le dio un toque hollywodense al duelo que paralizaba Harlem.\n\n“Cuando miré el tablero, dije ‘a la mierda’. Pero puse manos a la obra”. Peter Vecsey, mítico periodista que en ese momento escribía en el diario Daily News, estuvo en el lugar como reportero y su artículo, con fotos, es la principal referencia de aquel duelo. “La diferencia se evaporó más rápido que las anfetaminas”, escribió sobre el show de Hammond, quien asegura anotó 50 puntos en el segundo tiempo para forzar dos alargues y terminar siendo el mejor de una tarde que, igualmente, no terminó como el barrio quería... En el tiempo extra, Scott fue el mejor, llevando a los Westsiders al triunfo por 117-108, con Erving terminando con 39.\n\n“Fue tanta la rivalidad y lo que generó el partido que, cuando terminó, estábamos en un costado de la cancha y un amigo de Joe me dijo ‘buen partido, pero nunca más pases la calle 116 porque vas a morir’”, contó Scott, pese a que era nativo de Harlem. Pero, claro, él había elegido otro camino -la NCAA con North Carolina y luego la NBA, desde donde llego al Hall of Fame-, totalmente distinto al de las estrellas callejeras. “Por supuesto que nunca más volví a la zona luego de ese comentario. Mucha gente se tomó muy en serio ese partido”, completó.\n\nAunque salió derrotado, lo de Hammond fue una verdadera exhibición, demostrando que tenía potencial para jugar entre los mejores y ser incluso superior a ellos. También puso a Rucker Park en el mapa, entre los mejores lugares para jugar y ver el mejor básquet. Y no cualquier básquet, el callejero, que de repente había dejado de ser ya solo un pasatiempo o una vía de escape para muchos, sino que podía ser un lugar del que saliesen profesionales y de altísimo nivel.\n\nA partir de ese duelo, ya nada fue igual para Hammond. Su fama se disparó, Rucker se transformó en un lugar de culto y, pocos meses después, nada menos que los Lakers usaban una elección de draft para seleccionarlo. Pero, claro, eran tiempos oscuros para él. Desde chico, inducido por su tío, había entrado en el mundo de las drogas, ya no solo del consumo, sino también del tráfico. Algunos de sus amigos, para alejarlo de ese ambiente, lo empujaron a tomar la opción de jugar durante un tiempo en los Allentown Jets de la Eastern Basketball Association (EBA), una de las ligas que pululaban en ese momento buscando un lugar preferencial entre la gente. Pero Joe no sentía el básquet organizado y todo lo que él acarreaba. No había jugado en el secundario, tampoco en la universidad y no quería ir a la NBA. Al punto, cuentan, que no iba a jugar partidos a los que se sabía que asistirían scouts de la liga profesional. Nada parecía seducirlo ni interesarle. Le gusta estar en la calle y jugar en la calle…\n\nPor eso tampoco se conmovió cuando supo de la elección de los Lakers, el equipo sensación que había logrado formar un tridente de estrellas como el conformaban Jerry West, Elgin Baylor y Wilt Chamberlain. Los angelinos habían ganado 48 de los 82 juegos y sólo los había frenado Milwaukee Bucks, con Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, en la final del Oeste. Hammond era la pieza que faltaba para terminar de formar una ofensiva tan creativa como devastadora. La franquicia, entonces, decidió elegirlo con el #5 del Hardship Draft, una selección alternativa que se armó con aquellos jugadores que no habían completado sus estudios universitarios. Le ofrecieron, entonces, 50.000 dólares, una casa, un auto y tres años de contrato. Mucho más que al resto de los jugadores. Para Hammond era la chance de asegurar el futuro, de confirmar todo lo que había mostrado en la cancha, de jugar con estrellas y hasta de salir campeón, como pasaría con ese equipo en 1972, tras vencer a los Knicks en la final... Pero Joe ignoró todo eso, lo dejó pasar.\n\nLa explicación la dio él mismo. “Aquellos tipos debían pensar que le estaban ofreciendo el mundo a un miserable negro del ghetto, pero yo no necesitaba para nada su dinero. Vendía drogas y jugaba a los dados en la calle desde que tenía 10 años. Con 15 tenía una cuenta secreta de mi padre en el banco de 50.000 dólares y cuando los Lakers me hicieron la oferta yo ya tenía 200.000 en mi apartamento. Ganaba miles de dólares vendiendo heroína, cocaína, crack y marihuana. ¿Para qué necesitaba los 50.000 de los Lakers? Lo único que hice fue decirles que yo merecía lo mismo que sus jugadores porque en realidad era mucho mejor que la mayoría de ellos, pero rechazaron pagarme más. Ellos no podían entender cómo un pordiosero podría estar regateándoles así y por supuesto tampoco yo les dije por qué”, comentó sin pelos en la lengua.\n\nAsí se cerró definitivamente la puerta de la NBA, porque cuando los otros equipos conocieron la respuesta de Hammond, también lo descartaron rápidamente. Los Nets de Erving lo intentarían, nuevamente, en el 73, pensando que tal vez jugar con un rival que Hammond había respetado en las calles podía ser una opción. “Joe fue Magic antes que Magic”, afirmó Lou Carnesseca, dueño de los Nets por aquel entonces. Ni con ese elogio logró convencerlo. Joe volvió a desechar una oferta de tres años para seguir dedicándose a jugar en la calle, vender drogas -a esa altura había heredado el negocio del tío- y quemar el dinero en mujeres, fiestas y más drogas.\n\nDe a poco, fue perdiendo su lugar en el mundo del tráfico y del básquet. Y quedando cada vez más solo, en especial cuando el dinero dejó de llegar y no paró de irse, cuando la fama de las canchas ya no alcanzó para darle de comer. Ni para detener a la Policía. Hammond pasó 11 años en distintas prisiones de Estados Unidos y, para cuando salió, ya estaba acabado. En todo sentido. Le quedó la calle, su lugar. Allí pedía limosnas y vivía de lo que le daban aquellos que todavía recordaban lo grande que había sido como jugador.\n\nDicen que se “limpió”, que a los 73 años anda mejor que nunca, que está recuperado… Todavía hoy se lo puede ver por las calles de Harlem. Todavía lo paran, lo felicitan, le agradecen, les cuentan sus hazañas, sobre todo aquella de los 50 puntos en un segundo tiempo, tarde que él describe “como el show más grande de la Tierra, una historia que es más grande que el mismo básquet”. Asegura no arrepentirse de nada. “Imagino que yo estoy hecho de otra madera de la que están hechas las leyendas, pero lo seguro es que no soy el bastardo que le quisieron hacer creer a la gente que soy”. Una leyenda que vivió y jugó a su manera, como quiso y donde quiso. Y que todavía hoy es recordado como un mito."}

You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.Alfred Le Fermier: You may also likeAlford plea - Wikipedia: Type of guilty plea in the United States\n\nIn United States law, an Alford plea, also called a Kennedy plea in West Virginia,[1] an Alford guilty plea,[2][3][4] and the Alford doctrine,[5][6][7] is a guilty plea in criminal court,[8][9][10] whereby a defendant in a criminal case does not admit to the criminal act and asserts innocence, but accepts imposition of a sentence.[11][12][13] This plea is allowed even if the evidence to be presented by the prosecution would be likely to persuade a judge or jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.[5][14][15][16][17] This can be caused by circumstantial evidence and testimony favoring the prosecution, and difficulty finding evidence and witnesses that would aid the defense.\n\nAlford pleas are legally permissible in nearly all U.S. federal and state courts, except in the state courts of Indiana, Michigan, and New Jersey, or in the United States military courts.\n\nThe Alford guilty plea is named after the United States Supreme Court case of North Carolina v. Alford (1970).[10][12] Henry Alford had been indicted on a charge of first-degree murder in 1963. Evidence in the case included testimony from witnesses that Alford himself had said, after the victim's death, that he had killed the individual. Court testimony showed that Alford and the victim had argued at the victim's house. Alford left the house, and afterward, the victim received a fatal gunshot wound when he opened the door responding to a knock.[18]\n\nAlford was faced with the possibility of capital punishment if convicted in a jury trial.[19] The death penalty was the default sentence in North Carolina at the time if two criteria were satisfied: the defendant had to have pleaded not guilty, and the jury did not instead recommend a life sentence. Had Alford pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, he would have had the possibility of a life sentence and would have avoided the death penalty, but he did not want to admit guilt. Nonetheless, Alford pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and said he was doing so to avoid a death sentence, were he to be convicted of first-degree murder after attempting to contest that charge.[18][20] Alford was sentenced to 30 years in prison after the trial judge accepted the plea bargain and ruled that the defendant had been adequately advised by his lawyer.[18]\n\nAlford appealed and requested a new trial, arguing he was forced into a guilty plea because he was afraid of receiving a death sentence. The Supreme Court of North Carolina ruled that the defendant had voluntarily entered the guilty plea with knowledge of what that meant. Following this ruling, Alford petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, which upheld the initial ruling, and subsequently to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that Alford's plea was not voluntary because it was made under fear of the death penalty.[18] \"I just pleaded guilty because they said if I didn't, they would gas me for it,\" wrote Alford in one of his appeals.[21]\n\nThe case was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where Justice Byron White wrote the majority decision.[22] The Court held that for the plea to be accepted, the defendant must have been advised by a competent lawyer who could inform him that his best option was to enter a guilty plea.[19] The Court ruled that the defendant can enter such a plea \"when he concludes that his interests require a guilty plea and the record strongly indicates guilt.\"[21] The Court allowed the guilty plea with a simultaneous protestation of innocence only because there was enough evidence to show that the prosecution had a strong case for conviction and that the defendant was entering such a plea to avoid the possible sentence. The Court noted that even if the defendant could have shown that he would not have entered a guilty plea \"but for\" the rationale of receiving a lesser sentence, the plea itself would not have been ruled invalid.[19] As evidence existed that could have supported Alford's conviction, the Supreme Court held that his guilty plea was allowable, while the defendant himself still maintained that he was not guilty.[20]\n\nThe Dictionary of Politics: Selected American and Foreign Political and Legal Terms defines the term \"Alford plea\" as: \"A plea under which a defendant may choose to plead guilty, not because of an admission to the crime, but because the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to place a charge and to obtain conviction in court. The plea is commonly used in local and state courts in the United States.\"[16] According to University of Richmond Law Review, \"When offering an Alford plea, a defendant asserts his innocence but admits that sufficient evidence exists to convict him of the offense.\"[17] A Guide to Military Criminal Law notes that under the Alford plea, \"the defendant concedes that the prosecution has enough evidence to convict, but the defendant still refuses to admit guilt.\"[15] The book Plea Bargaining's Triumph: A History of Plea Bargaining in America published by Stanford University Press defines the plea as one in \"which the defendant adheres to his/her claim of innocence even while allowing that the government has enough evidence to prove his/her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\".[14] According to the book Gender, Crime, and Punishment published by Yale University Press, \"Under the Alford doctrine, a defendant does not admit guilt but admits that the state has sufficient evidence to find him or her guilty, should the case go to trial.\"[5] Webster's New World Law Dictionary defines Alford plea as: \"A guilty plea entered as part of a plea bargain by a criminal defendant who denies committing the crime or who does not actually admit his guilt. In federal courts, such plea may be accepted as long as there is evidence that the defendant is actually guilty.\"[10]\n\nThe Alford guilty plea is \"a plea of guilty containing a protestation of innocence\".[8] The defendant pleads guilty, but does not have to specifically admit to the guilt itself.[24] The defendant maintains a claim of innocence, but agrees to the entry of a conviction in the charged crime.[25] Upon receiving an Alford guilty plea from a defendant, the court may immediately pronounce the defendant guilty and impose sentence as if the defendant had otherwise been convicted of the crime.[13] Sources disagree, as may differing states' laws, as to what category of plea the Alford plea falls under: Some sources state that the Alford guilty plea is a form of nolo contendere, where the defendant in the case states \"no contest\" to the factual matter of the case as given in the charges outlined by the prosecution.[12] Others hold that an Alford plea is simply one form of a guilty plea,[9][10] and, as with other guilty pleas, the judge must see there is some factual basis for the plea.[13]\n\nDefendants can take advantage of the ability to use the Alford guilty plea by admitting there is enough evidence to convict them of a more serious crime, while at the same time pleading guilty to a lesser charge.[26] Defendants usually enter an Alford guilty plea if they want to avoid a possibly worse sentence were they to lose the case against them at trial.[13] It affords defendants the ability to accept a plea bargain while maintaining innocence.[27]\n\nThis form of guilty plea has been frequently used in local and state courts in the United States,[16] though it constitutes a small percentage of all plea bargains in the US.[14] This form of plea is not allowed in courts of the United States military.[15][18] In 2000, the United States Department of Justice noted: \"In an Alford plea the defendant agrees to plead guilty because he or she realizes that there is little chance to win acquittal because of the strong evidence of guilt. About 17% of State inmates and 5% of Federal inmates submitted either an Alford plea or a no contest plea, regardless of the type of attorney. This difference reflects the relative readiness of State courts, compared to Federal courts, to accept an alternative plea.\"[28]\n\nIn the 1995 case State of Idaho v. Howry before the Idaho Court of Appeals, the Court commented on the impact of the Alford guilty plea on later sentencing.[29] The Court ruled: \"Although an Alford plea allows a defendant to plead guilty amid assertions of innocence, it does not require a court to accept those assertions. The sentencing court may, of necessity, consider a broad range of information, including the evidence of the crime, the defendant's criminal history and the demeanor of the defendant, including the presence or absence of remorse.\"[29] In the 1999 South Carolina Supreme Court case State v. Gaines, that court held that Alford guilty pleas would be considered valid even in the absence of a specific on-the-record ruling that the pleas were voluntary, provided that the sentencing judge acted appropriately in accordance with the rules for acceptance of a plea made voluntarily by the defendant.[30] The Court held that a ruling that the plea was entered into voluntarily is implied by the act of sentencing.[30]\n\nIn a 2006 case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Ballard v. Burton, Judge Carl E. Stewart writing for the court held that an Alford guilty plea is a \"variation of an ordinary guilty plea\".[32] In October 2008, the United States Department of Justice defined an Alford plea as follows: \"the defendant maintains his or her innocence with respect to the charge to which he or she offers to plead guilty\".[31]\n\nIn March 2009, the Minnesota House of Representatives characterized the Alford plea as \"a form of a guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges on the record that the prosecutor could present enough evidence to prove guilt.\"[33] The Minnesota Judicial Branch similarly states: \"Alford Plea: A plea of guilty that may be accepted by a court even where the defendant does not admit guilt. In an Alford plea, defendant has to admit that he has reviewed the state's evidence, a reasonable jury could find him guilty, and he wants to take advantage of a plea offer that has been made. Court has discretion as to whether to accept this type of plea.\"[34]\n\nThe U.S. Attorneys' Manual states that in the federal system, Alford pleas \"should be avoided except in the most unusual circumstances, even if no plea agreement is involved and the plea would cover all pending charges.\" U.S. Attorneys are required to obtain the approval of an Assistant Attorney General with supervisory responsibility over the subject matter before accepting such a plea.[35][36]\n\nThe Alford plea has received public attention for its use in resolving high-profile post-conviction proceedings for individuals who claim they were wrongfully convicted for crimes they did not commit.[37] In 2011, the West Memphis Three—three men who had been convicted as teenagers of the 1993 murders of three children and sentenced to life in prison or, for one defendant, the death penalty—entered Alford pleas decades following their initial convictions.[37][38] New evidence had come to light that might exonerate them, so the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered an evidentiary hearing to consider whether a new trial would be required.[39] Instead of holding the hearing, the defendants and state prosecutors agreed that the court would vacate the prior convictions to permit the defendants to enter Alford pleas, be re-sentenced to \"time served,\" and obtain immediate release from prison.[37][38][39] As part of the plea deal, the men agreed not to sue the state seeking civil damages for their convictions and imprisonment.[38][39]\n\nSimilarly, novelist Michael Peterson, who had been convicted in 2003 of murdering his wife, entered an Alford plea in 2017 to resolve the case against him. Peterson's case had been the subject of the 2004 documentary series The Staircase and other media scrutiny, and Peterson continued to challenge his conviction based on alleged law enforcement misconduct and judicial errors. He was eventually granted a new trial, but then agreed to enter an Alford plea to the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter instead. The judge then imposed a sentence that, after being reduced to account for time already served, resulted in Peterson serving no additional time in prison.[37] A 2022 scripted drama miniseries, also called The Staircase, portrayed the events of the case, including the legal battle and Alford plea.[37]\n\nIn his book American Criminal Justice (1972), Jonathan D. Casper comments: \"The Alford decision recognizes the plea-bargaining system, acknowledging that a man may maintain his innocence but still plead guilty in order to minimize his potential loss.\"[40] Casper comments on the impact of the Supreme Court's decision to require evidence of guilt in such a plea: \"By requiring that there be some evidence of guilt in such a situation, the decision attempts to protect the 'really' innocent from the temptations to which plea-bargaining and defense attorneys may subject them.\"[40]\n\nU.S. Air Force attorney Steven E. Walburn argues in a 1998 article in The Air Force Law Review that this form of guilty plea should be adopted for usage by the United States military.[18] \"In fairness to an accused, if, after consultation with his defense counsel, he knowingly and intelligently determines that his best interest is served by an Alford-type guilty plea, he should be free to choose this path. The system should not force him to lie under oath, nor to go to trial with no promise of the ultimate outcome concerning guilt or punishment. We must trust the accused to make such an important decision for himself. The military provides an accused facing court-martial with a qualified defense attorney. Together, they are in the best position to properly weigh what the impact his decision, and the resulting conviction, will have upon himself and his family.\"[18] He emphasizes that when allowing these pleas, \"trial counsel should establish as strong a factual basis as possible\", in order to minimize the possible negative outcomes to \"the public's perception of the administration of justice within the military\".[18]\n\nStephanos Bibas writes in a 2003 analysis for Cornell Law Review that Judge Frank H. Easterbrook and a majority of scholars \"praise these pleas as efficient, constitutional means of resolving cases\".[11] Bibas notes that prominent plea bargain critic Albert Alschuler supports the use of this form of plea: \"He views them as a lesser evil, a way to empower defendants within a flawed system. As long as we have plea bargaining, he maintains, innocent defendants should be free to use these pleas to enter advantageous plea bargains without lying. And guilty defendants who are in denial should be empowered to use these pleas instead of being forced to stand trial.\"[11] Bibas instead asserts that this form of plea is \"unwise and should be abolished\":[11] \"These procedures may be constitutional and efficient, but they undermine key values served by admissions of guilt in open court. They undermine the procedural values of accuracy and public confidence in accuracy and fairness, by convicting innocent defendants and creating the perception that innocent defendants are being pressured into pleading guilty. More basically, they allow guilty defendants to avoid accepting responsibility for their wrongs.\"[11]\n\nLegal scholar Jim Drennan, an expert on the court system at the Institute of Government at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told the Winston-Salem Journal in a 2007 interview that the ability to use this form of guilty plea as an option in courts had a far-reaching effect throughout the United States: \"We have lots of laws, but human interaction creates unique circumstances and the law has to adapt.\"[21] He added that the Supreme Court \"had to make a decision about what to do. One of the things the court has to do is figure out how to answer new questions, and that is what happened in this case.\"[21]\n\nCommon criticisms of Alford pleas include harm to victims who are denied justice, harm to society from lack of respect for the criminal justice system, the incentive for coercion, violating the right against self-incrimination, hindering rehabilitation by avoiding treatment, and the arbitrary nature in which they are utilized, allowing a person to say one thing when they mean another.[41]\n• None McConville, Mike (1998). \"Plea Bargainings: Ethics and Politics\".

(2:26)\n\nEl boxeador mexicano Marco Verde ganó la medalla de plata en Paris 2024, te decimos los premios que recibirá por la presea\n\nMarco Verde rompió con los pronósticos del boxeo de los -71 kilogramos en Paris 2024. El boxeador llegó a la final y se llevó la medalla de plata, cuando en las prediciones era el bronce la presea que le asignaban al mexicano.\n\nEn el combate ante el uzbeco Asadkhuja Muydinkhujaev se jugó varios millones de pesos. El pugilista mexicano recibirá 3 millones 693 mil 460 pesos con la medalla plateada.\n\nLa bolsa de tres millones de pesos se da gracias a la suma de premios que da el gobierno mexicano, la iniciativa privada y Asociación Internacional de Boxeo, IBA por sus siglas en inglés.\n\nDe acuerdo con Ana Gabriela Guevara, titular de la CONADE, los medallistas de plata se llevarán un premio de dos millones de pesos, cifra que podría aumentar en caso de que el Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, decida o anuncie un aumento a la cifra.\n\nAdemás de los dos millones de pesos, la IBA le entrega a los ganadores de medalla de plata un premio de 50 mil dólares, que equivale a 943 mil 460 pesos. Ese estímulo deportivo, Marco Verde lo debe de repartir: 25% de esa cantidad es para su entrenador y otro 25% para su federación, el resto 50% es para el atleta.\n\nTambién la iniciativa privada se suma a los premios para los medallistas olímpicos mexicanos. En el caso de la presea de plata que ganó Marco Verde, la Fundación Telmex entrega 250 mil pesos, mientras que las Farmacias Similares dan 500 mil por el metal plateado.\n\nEl gobierno estatal de Sinaloa prometió que también recompensará el esfuerzo del boxeador mexicano, pero no ha definido montos y tampoco mecanismos para entregarle un premio al atleta originario de esa entidad.\n\n¿Cuánto apoyo le entregó la CONADE a Marco Verde en el ciclo olímpico?\n\nLa CONADE le aportó a Marco Verde dos millones 469 mil pesos en el proceso rumbo a los Juegos Olímpicos de Paris 2024, por el concepto de becas y estímulos económicos.\n\nEl pugilista mexicano, que ganó la medalla de plata, apenas recibió 396 mil pesos por el concepto de becas en el ciclo olímpico, mientras que necesitó de sumar buenos resultados para garantizar un ingreso de dos millones 430 mil pesos por el concepto de estímulos económicos o premios, como el título panamericano en Santiago 2023, que le dio el pase a Juegos Olímpicos.Verner Weckman - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Johan Verner Weckman (26 de julio de 1882 - 22 de febrero de 1968) fue un luchador del deporte finlandés que compitió en los Juegos Olímpicos intercalados de 1906 y en los Juegos Olímpicos de 1908.\n\nNació en Loviisa en una familia de agricultores. Inspirado por los luchadores del circo, Weckman comenzó a practicar la lucha grecorromana y ganó su primer campeonato finlandés en 1904 contra Verner Järvinen.

Única nave de su clase, fue también el primer gran buque de guerra construido en Alemania tras la Primera Guerra Mundial. De acuerdo con la secuencia, fue el tercer buque de la armada alemana en ostentar dicho nombre, siendo su epónimo la ciudad de Emden, en la actual Baja Sajonia y por entonces integrada en el Estado Libre de Prusia.\n\nSu quilla fue puesta en grada en el astillero Reichsmarinewerft de Wilhelmshaven en diciembre de 1921, la botadura del casco se produjo en enero de 1925 y el crucero entró en servicio en la marina alemana en octubre de ese mismo año.\n\nSu diseño estuvo claramente delimitado por las restricciones estipuladas en el Tratado de Versalles y por los dictados de la comisión de desarme de los aliados. Así, fue armado con una batería principal de ocho cañones de 150 mm, todos excedentes de la guerra mundial, montados en torretas individuales, tal y como ordenaron los aliados. Su velocidad máxima era de 29 nudos (54 km/h).\n\nEl Emden actuó la mayor parte de su carrera como buque escuela y en el período de entreguerras realizó varios cruceros de adiestramiento para cadetes. Con el estallido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial fue empleado para crear campos de minas frente a las costas alemanas y resultó dañado por un bombardero británico que se estrelló contra el crucero.\n\nParticipó en la invasión de Noruega en abril de 1940, tras lo que regresó a su rol de buque escuela en el mar Báltico. Cumplió esta función con pequeñas interrupciones hasta septiembre de 1944, cuando fue desplegado en Noruega como buque insignia de las fuerzas alemanas destinadas a la colocación de minas.\n\nEn enero de 1945 transportó los restos exhumados de Paul von Hindenburg desde Prusia Oriental a Pillau para evitar que cayeran en manos soviéticas. Mientras era reparado en Kiel el Emden resultó gravemente dañado por un bombardeo británico y poco después sus tripulantes lo vararon y volaron a la entrada del puerto.\n\nLos restos del naufragio fueron desguazados para chatarra in situ durante los siguientes años, ​ ​ hasta 1949. La ornamentación de su proa se exhibe actualmente en el Deutsches Museum en Múnich. ​\n• None , Gerhard; , Klaus-Peter (2014). German Light Cruisers of World War II: Warships of the Kriegsmarine .

Como parte de una gira de buena voluntad promocionando los Juegos Olímpicos de Berlín. La tripulación del barco viajó en tren hasta la Ciudad de Guatemala, donde desfilaron ante militares de alto rango del gobierno del general Ubico y el público en general. ​\n\nDurante el gobierno del Tercer Reich (1933-1945) en Alemania, que coincidió casi por completo con el régimen de Ubico en términos temporales, hubo rumores que suponían que los alemanes en la Verapaz querían establecerse como una «nueva Alemania» con la política nacional socialista de Hitler. ​ Los alemanes habían adquirido terrenos, manzanas, casas y fincas gracias a las concesiones de los presidentes liberales que gobernaron de 1885 a 1920 en Guatemala, ​ y gozaron de privilegios durante el gobierno dictatorial del general Jorge Ubico, que simpatizaba con las políticas fascistas de Benito Mussolini en Italia, Francisco Franco en España y Adolf Hitler en Alemania. ​ ​\n\nUn incidente que afectó la existencia de la comunidad alemana verapacense fue cuando entre 1935 y 1936, el Tercer Reich pidió votar a sus ciudadanos sobre la anexión de Austria a Alemania: un barco alemán ancló en Puerto Barrios para efectuar la actividad y quienes asistieron fueron «fichados» como simpatizantes del régimen nazi de Adolf Hitler.[4]​ ​ ​\n\nEn la Ciudad de Guatemala en 1933, fue fundada la Deutsches Haus (Casa del Partido), y más tarde se fundaron también en Quetzaltenango, Cobán, Retalhuleu, Mazatenango y Puerto Barrios y los alemanes residentes en Guatemala fundaron la Asociación de Trabajo de la Mujer Alemana. Además, desde 1935, simpatizantes del partido se hicieron con el control del Deutsche Zeitung, periódico que había sido fundado por alemanes en 1931.[4]​[6]​\n\nEse mismo año, se fundaron las juventudes hitlerianas en el Colegio Alemán, se adoptó la práctica del saludo de Hitler y se trató de hacer valer la teoría nazi de los arios, sin percatarse de que el Colegio Alemán tenía estudiantes de padres judíos. Y aunque muchos de estos grupos se dedicaban a actividades fundamentalmente culturales y a conmemorar la celebración de algunas fechas muy importantes para el nacionalsocialismo como el cumpleaños del Führer, el ascenso de Hitler al poder y el Día del Trabajo; los alemanes simpatizantes con el régimen tuvieron conflictos con el resto de germanos residentes en Guatemala, que habían llegado al país en el siglo XIX y que ya habían establecido sus familias en el país.[4]​[6]​ Más tarde, en el año de 1937, Jorge Ubico recibió una carta del canciller alemán, Adolf Hitler, donde le felicitaba por su gobierno en Guatemala.[4]​[6]​\n\nLa tensión se incrementó en 1939 con el inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial tras la invasión alemana de Polonia, y llegó a un punto crítico cuando Japón atacó la base militar estadounidense de Pearl Harbor, lo que precipitó el ingreso de los Estados Unidos en el conflicto. ​ Estos últimos tenían una gran influencia en el gobierno guatemalteco, gracias a las concesiones otorgadas a las empresas norteamericanas como la United Fruit Company, que tenía el monopolio de la exportación de banano y por el que prácticamente no pagaba impuestos a Guatemala, y el transporte por ferrocarril por medio de su subsidiaria International Railroads of Central America (IRCA). La frutera era el pilar más fuerte del gobierno de Ubico y formaba parte de la política estadounidense que se había iniciado con el presidente Theodore Roosevelt durante las negociaciones con Colombia para la construcción del Canal de Panamá en 1903. ​ Como consecuencia, los Estados Unidos obligaron al presidente Jorge Ubico a expulsar a los alemanes de Guatemala y a intervenir todas sus propiedades.[8]​ ​ Los alemanes varones se vieron obligados a abandonar el país e ingresar en las filas del Ejército alemán. El historiador guatemalteco Francis Polo Sifontes cuenta que durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial muchos alemanes fueron llamados para prestar servicio militar en su país. Después de la guerra, algunos quedaron recluidos en los campos de concentración de Rusia, y otros alegaron ser guatemaltecos para evitar la prisión.[6]​ ​Emden las hazañas del famoso crucero alemán en los mares de Oriente – El Cazador: Título: Emden las hazañas del famoso crucero alemán en los mares de Oriente\n\n Autor: Hellmuth Von Mucke\n\n Páginas: 190\n\n Fotos: no\n\n Año de edición: 2009\n\n Medidas: 23cm x 15cm\n\n Tapa blanda\n\n Estado: Usado en excelente estado\n\n Idioma: Castellano"}

This was part of a joint military exercise between the two branches to strengthen national security and maintain readiness. (Courtesy photo)\n\nJoint military exercises involving multiple U.S. military branches play an important role in strengthening our national security and maintaining readiness. Such was the case for the collaboration between the U.S. Air Force’s 53rd Combat Airfield Operations Squadron from Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, and U.S. Marine Corps’ Marine Air Control Squadron 2 unit from Cherry Point, North Carolina, for an exercise at the Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command and Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California, Jan. 5 - Feb. 24, 2024.\n\n“The mission of the 53rd CAOS is to provide austere airfield opening, precision approach capability and landing zone services at a moment’s notice anywhere in the world,” said U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Harley Brydon, 53rd CAOS senior enlisted leader. “It was important for CAOS to embed with the USMC so that we can practice interoperability in accordance with our techniques, tactics and procedures, including learning best practices regarding joint airfield opening post-airfield seizure, and how to do airspace and airfield status reporting in a joint combat environment.”\n\nThe Robins unit also learned about the radar program Air Traffic Navigation, Integration, and Coordination System, which the USMC has been operating for several years.\n\nTwentynine Palms, Ca. – U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jason Buck, standing, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt.

This was part of a joint military exercise between the 53rd CAOS and United States Marine Corps’ Marine Air Control Squadron 2 unit from Cherry Point, North Carolina. (Courtesy photo)\n\n“The Air Force’s partnership and collaboration with the Marine Corps is critical to our ability to produce joint fires and effects against adversaries in a high-end fight,” said Brydon. “It is critical for our units in each branch to be able to seamlessly integrate into each other’s formations at operating locations in a contested environment to meet operational requirements in a time of Great Power Competition.”\n\n“This collaboration is particularly important for the USMC and USAF air traffic control communities because they are such similar fields,” said Means. “There will always be opportunities, both in peacetime training and in combat, for us to work together and fill gaps that each service may have.”\n\nThe mission of MACS-2 is multifaceted in supporting both offensive and defensive air operations. MACS-2 is responsible for detecting and identifying hostile aircraft and missiles within their area of operation. Their radar systems and surveillance capabilities allow them to track and assess potential threats.\n\n“This gave our Marines and Airmen a chance to perform our function as a command-and-control node, pushing and pulling information throughout the exercise to decision makers and the tactical units engaged during the mission,” Means continued. “Having Marines and Airmen work together increases our confidence when working together in the future because we will have a common experience to draw upon.”\n\nTwentynine Palms, Ca. – U.S. Air Force Airmen with the 53rd Combat Airfield Operations Squadron from Robins Air Force Base, Georgia, and members of the U.S. Marine Corps’ Marine Air Control Squadron 2 unit from Cherry Point, North Carolina, participate in a joint airfield exercise at Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center, California, Jan. 5 - Feb. 24, 2024.

Este entró en vigor el 28 de abril de 1952. Su nombre en español es Tratado de Paz con Japón.\n\nEste tratado sirvió para terminar oficialmente la Segunda Guerra Mundial, acabar formalmente con la posición de Japón como una potencia imperial, asignar compensación a civiles aliados y antiguos prisioneros de guerra que habían sufrido crímenes de guerra japoneses, terminar la ocupación militar aliada y devolver la soberanía a Japón. Este tratado hizo uso extenso de la Carta de Naciones Unidas y la Declaración Universal de Derechos Humanos para articular los objetivos de los Aliados.\n\nSe dice que este tratado, junto con el Tratado de Seguridad firmado aquel mismo día, marca el principio del \"Sistema de San Francisco\", este término, acuñado por el historiador John Dower, establece los efectos de la relación de Japón con los Estados Unidos y su papel en la arena internacional como determinados por estos dos tratados y es usado para hablar de las maneras en las que estos efectos han gobernado la historia de posguerra de Japón.\n\nArabia Saudita, Argentina, Australia, Bélgica, Bolivia, Brasil, Camboya, Canadá, Ceilán, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Checoslovaquia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Estados Unidos, Etiopía, Filipinas, Francia, Guatemala, Haití, Honduras, Indonesia, Irán, Laos, Líbano, Liberia, Luxemburgo, México, Nicaragua, Noruega, Nueva Zelanda, Países Bajos, Pakistán, Panamá, Paraguay, Perú, Polonia, Reino de Egipto, Reino de Grecia, Reino de Irak, Reino Unido de Gran Bretaña e Irlanda del Norte, República Dominicana, Siria, Turquía, Unión Soviética, Unión Sudafricana, Uruguay, Venezuela, Estado de Vietnam y Japón.\n\nBirmania, India y Yugoslavia también fueron invitadas, pero no participaron. Ni la República de China en Taiwán ni la República Popular de China continental fueron invitadas debido a la guerra civil china y la controversia sobre cuál de los dos gobierno era el legítimo. Tampoco fueron invitadas Corea del Norte y Corea del Sur debido al mismo problema. Tampoco fue invitado Portugal a pesar de haber sido invadido su territorio de Timor Oriental por Japón, habiendo permanecido neutral en la guerra.\n\n48 países participantes firmaron el tratado. Checoslovaquia, Polonia y la Unión Soviética se negaron a firmarlo. Indonesia firmó el tratado, pero no lo ratificó.\n\nEl documento oficialmente renuncia los derechos de tratado de Japón obtenidos del Protocolo Bóxer de 1901 y sus derechos a Corea, Formosa (Taiwán), Hong Kong (una colonia británica), las Islas Kuriles, las Islas Pescadores, las Islas Spratly, Antártida y la isla de Sajalín. El tratado no declara formalmente qué naciones son soberanas en estas áreas, una cuestión que algunos partidarios de la independencia de Taiwán usan para justificar la autodeterminación taiwanesa según el Artículo 77b de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas, que aplica administraciones fiduciarias \"a territorios que pueden ser separados de Estados enemigos a consecuencia de la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\" Sin embargo, excepto las Ryūkyū, las áreas sobre las cuales Japón renunció a la soberanía nunca fueron traídas conforme a ningún arreglo de administración fiduciaria de Naciones Unidas formal y de ahí las especificaciones del Artículo 77 no fueron aplicadas.\n\nEl artículo 3 del tratado formalmente pone a las islas Ryukyu, que incluyen Okinawa y los grupos de islas Amami, Miyako y Yaeyama, bajo la administración fiduciaria estadounidense. Las Islas Amami fueron traspasadas finalmente a Japón el 25 de diciembre de 1953 y en 1969 las negociaciones de Estados Unidos con Japón autorizaron la transferencia de autoridad sobre las Ryukyu a Japón para ser puesta en práctica en 1972. En 1972, \"la reversión\" de los Estados Unidos de las Ryukyu ocurrió junto con el traspaso del control de las Islas Senkaku (deshabitadas) cercanas sin adoptar una actitud en la soberanía última de las Islas Senkaku, que son reclamadas tanto por la República Popular de China como por la República de China (Taiwán).\n\nPor el Artículo 11 Japón aceptó los juicios del Tribunal Militar Internacional para el Lejano Oriente y de otros Tribunales Aliados de Crímenes de Guerra, ambos dentro y fuera de Japón y consintió en cumplir las sentencias impuestas así sobre ciudadanos japoneses encarcelados en Japón.\n\nEl documento posterior puso pautas para la repatriación de prisioneros de guerra y renuncia a la futura agresión militar conforme a las pautas puestas por la Carta de Naciones Unidas. El documento anula tratados previos y pone el marco para el estatus actual de Japón de conservar unas fuerzas armadas que son puramente defensivas en naturaleza.\n\nHay también un poco de ambigüedad en cuanto a qué islas Japón ha renunciado la soberanía. Esto ha conducido tanto al conflicto de las Islas Kuriles como a la disputa de las islas Diaoyutai/Senkaku.\n\nNi la República Nacionalista de China ni la República Popular comunista de China fueron invitadas a la Conferencia de Paz de San Francisco y por lo tanto ninguno firmó este tratado. La República de China (Taiwán), sin embargo, firmó un Tratado separado de Taipéi con Japón en 1952, que reconoció los términos del Tratado de San Francisco.\n\nAlgunos partidarios de la independencia de Taiwán sostienen que el Tratado de San Francisco justifica la independencia de Taiwán porque no concede explícitamente Taiwán a la República de China o a la República Popular de China. Esta justificación legal es rechazada tanto por el gobierno de la República de China como por el de la República Popular, los cuales ambos basan sus reclamaciones legales sobre Taiwán en el Acta de Rendición de Japón que, argumentan, incorpora la Declaración de Potsdam y la Declaración de El Cairo. Además, en años más recientes, partidarios de la independencia de Taiwán más a menudo confiaban en argumentos basados en autodeterminación y soberanía popular y menos en argumentos puramente legales.\n\nLa Unión Soviética rechazó firmar el Tratado de San Francisco. Ningún tratado de paz separado ha sido firmado con Japón hasta después de que la Unión Soviética sufrió un colapso en 1991. Esto ha impedido que las disputas territoriales ruso-japonesas hayan sido resueltas.\n\nLos activos extranjeros japoneses se refieren a todos los activos poseídos por el gobierno japonés, firmas, organización y ciudadanos privados, en países colonizados u ocupados. De acuerdo con la Cláusula 14 del Tratado, las fuerzas Aliadas confiscaron todos los activos extranjeros japoneses, excepto aquellos en China, que fueron tratados con conforme a la Cláusula 21. China poseyó de nuevo todos los activos japoneses en Manchuria y Mongolia Interior, que incluyó trabajos mineros e infraestructura de ferrocarril. Además, la Cláusula 4 del tratado declaró que \"la disposición de propiedad de Japón y de sus ciudadanos ... y sus reclamaciones ... contra las autoridades que actualmente administran tales áreas y los residentes ... será el sujeto de arreglos especiales entre Japón y tales autoridades.\" Por consiguiente, se considera que Corea también tuvo derecho a los derechos proporcionados por la Cláusula 21.\n\nActivos extranjeros japoneses en 1945 (1945, ¥15=1US$- dólar de Estados Unidos)\n\nLa cláusula 16 del Tratado de San Francisco señala:\n\nEn señal de su deseo de indemnizar a aquellos miembros de las fuerzas armadas de los Poderes Aliados que sufrieron privaciones excesivas mientras los prisioneros de guerra del Japón, Japón transferirá sus activos y aquellos de sus ciudadanos en países que eran neutros durante la guerra, o que estaban en la guerra con cualquiera de los Poderes Aliados, o, a su opción, el equivalente de tales activos, al Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja que liquidará tales activos y distribuirá el fondo consiguiente para asignar agencias nacionales, a beneficio de antiguos prisioneros de guerra y sus familias en tal base cuando esto puede determinar de ser equitativo. Las categorías de activos descritos en el Artículo 14 (a) 2 (II) (ii) por (de v) del Tratado presente serán excluidas de transferencia, así como activos de personas naturales japonesas no residentes de Japón en la primera entrada en vigor del Tratado. Es igualmente entendido que la provisión de transferencia de este Artículo no tiene ninguna aplicación a las 19,770 acciones en el Banco para Establecimientos Internacionales actualmente poseídos por instituciones financieras japonesas.\n\nEn consecuencia, Japón pagó £ 4,500,000 a la Cruz Roja.\n\nLa cláusula 14 del tratado declaró que \"Japón firmará puntualmente negociaciones con Poderes Aliados tan deseosos, cuyos territorios presentes fueron ocupados por fuerzas japonesas y dañados por Japón, con miras a la asistencia a compensar aquellos países para el coste de reparar el daño hecho, poniendo los servicios a disposición de las personas japonesas en la producción, salvando y otro trabajo para los Poderes Aliados en cuestión.\"\n\nEn consecuencia, Filipinas y Vietnam del Sur recibieron la compensación en 1956 y 1959 respectivamente. Birmania e Indonesia no eran signatarios originales, pero ellos más tarde firmaron el tratado bilateral de acuerdo con la Cláusula 14 del Tratado de San Francisco.\n\nCompensación japonesa a los países ocupados durante 1941–45\n\nEl último pago fue hecho a Filipinas el 22 de julio de 1976.La Conferencia de San Francisco | Naciones Unidas: Delegados de cincuenta naciones se reunieron en San Francisco entre el 25 de abril y el 26 de junio de 1945 en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre Organización Internacional. Trabajando en las propuestas de Dumbarton Oaks, el Acuerdo de Yalta y las enmiendas propuestas por varios gobiernos, la Conferencia acordó la Carta de las Naciones Unidas y el Estatuto de la Nueva Corte Internacional de Justicia. Cuarenta y seis naciones, comprendidas las que habían apadrinado la conferencia, fueron invitadas a San Francisco; todas ellas habían declarado la guerra a Alemania y al Japón y habían suscrito la Declaración de las Naciones Unidas. Sólo una - Polonia - no concurrió debido a que la formación de su nuevo gobierno no llegó oportunamente a conocimiento de la conferencia. Por tanto, se dejó un espacio en blanco para la firma de dicho país, que se contaba entre los signatarios originales de la declaración. Cuando se reunió la conferencia no existía un gobierno polaco universalmente reconocido, mas, a su advenimiento el 28 de junio de 1945, se allanó este obstáculo, y el 15 de octubre del mismo año dicho país firmó la Carta y se convirtió en uno de los miembros originarios. La conferencia invitó directamente a cuatro estados más: la R.S.S. de Bielorrusia, la R.S.S. de Ucrania, Dinamarca, que acababa de ser liberada, y Argentina. En esta forma, los delegados de cincuenta naciones, que representaban un ochenta por ciento de la población total del mundo, se reunieron en la Conferencia de San Francisco en abril de 1945. Documental sobre la Conferencia de San Francisco y la firma de la Carta de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nLos trabajos de la Conferencia de San Francisco se organizaron como se indica a continuación. El órgano supremo fue la Conferencia en sesión plenaria, que estuvo a cargo de la votación y aprobación finales del texto. Por debajo del plenario, se establecieron cuatro comités:\n• El Comité Directivo, integrado por los presidentes de todas las delegaciones, que examinó las principales cuestiones de política y procedimiento;\n• El Comité Ejecutivo, integrado por los presidentes de 14 delegaciones (las de los cuatro gobiernos patrocinadores y diez miembros coelegidos), que prestó servicios al Comité Directivo preparando recomendaciones para su examen;\n• El Comité de Coordinación, integrado por miembros técnicos de las mismas 14 delegaciones, que prestó asistencia al Comité Ejecutivo y que contó, a su vez, con la asistencia de un Comité Asesor de Juristas; y\n• El Comité de Verificación de Poderes, formado por representantes de seis delegaciones, que verificó las credenciales de los delegados. Reunión del Comité Directivo el 10 de mayo de 1945 en San Francisco. Mesa central, de izquierda a derecha: Bitwodded Makonnen Endalkachau, Etiopía; Camilo Ponce Enríquez, Ecuador; y asesor. Foto ONU/Eastman Por debajo de este nivel, el estudio de las cuestiones más importantes que debían resolverse se dividió entre cuatro comisiones generales, que coordinaron la labor de doce comités técnicos, encargados de la preparación de propuestas de redacción; cuando hacía falta, los comités técnicos podían designar subcomités. Los trabajos se organizaron de la manera siguiente:\n• La Comisión I (Disposiciones Generales) coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Preámbulo, Propósitos y Principios) y el Comité Técnico 2 (Miembros, Reforma y Secretaría);\n• La Comisión II (Asamblea General) coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Estructura y Procedimientos), el Comité Técnico 2 (Funciones Políticas y de Seguridad), el Comité Técnico 3 (Cooperación Económica y Social) y el Comité Técnico 4 (Régimen de Administración Fiduciaria);\n• La Comisión III (Consejo de Seguridad), coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Estructura y Procedimientos), el Comité Técnico 2 (Arreglo Pacífico), el Comité Técnico 3 (Disposiciones en materia de Aplicación) y el Comité Técnico 4 (Acuerdos Regionales); y\n• La Comisión IV (Organización Judicial), coordinó los trabajos del Comité Técnico 1 (Corte Internacional de Justicia) y el Comité Técnico 2 (Problemas Jurídicos). Una Secretaría prestó servicios de administración general a la Conferencia. En paralelo a esta estructura oficial, se celebraron consultas oficiosas entre las delegaciones, en particular entre las cinco potencias principales asistentes a la Conferencia (los Estados Unidos, el Reino Unido, la URSS, China y Francia). En la Conferencia se examinaron más de cinco mil documentos y se publicó una recopilación de los documentos principales con el título Documents of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, San Francisco, volúmenes I a XX, 1945-1954. La Carta de las Naciones Unidas, junto con el Estatuto de la Corte Internacional de Justicia, que forma parte integrante de la Carta, se aprobó por unanimidad al término de la Conferencia, el 25 de junio de 1945 en la Ópera de San Francisco, y se firmó al día siguiente en el auditorio del Teatro Herbst del Veterans War Memorial Building. Entró en vigor, de conformidad con el párrafo 3 de su Artículo 110, el 24 de octubre de 1945, tras el depósito de los instrumentos de ratificación de los cinco miembros permanentes del Consejo de Seguridad y una mayoría de los demás signatarios. Asistieron 850 delegados, que con sus asesores y colaboradores, y el personal de la secretaría, sumaban 3500. Fueron allá, además, 2500 representantes de la prensa, la radio y los noticieros cinematográficos, y observadores procedentes de numerosas organizaciones y sociedades. En suma, la conferencia de San Francisco fue una de las más importantes de la historia, y quizás también la mayor de las reuniones internacionales que jamás se hayan efectuado. Los jefes de delegación de los países que la convocaron, señores Anthony Eden, de la Gran Bretana, Edward Stettinius, de los Estados Unidos, T. V. Soong, de China, y Vyacheslav Molotov, de la Unión Soviética, se turnaron en la presidencia de las sesiones plenarias. En reuniones posteriores, lord Halifax reemplazo al señor Eden, el Sr. V. K. Wellington al Sr. T. V. Soong, y el señor Gromyko al señor Molotov.\n\nEn conferencias de esta índole, las sesiones plenarias constituyen siempre la etapa final, pues antes de que en ellas se someta a votación cualquier proposición, es necesario realizar una gran suma de trabajo en las comisiones preparatorias. El procedimiento de votación que se empleo en San Francisco es de inusitada importancia, pues cada parte de la Carta tuvo que ser aprobada por una mayoría de dos tercios de los delegados. He aquí cómo pudo la conferencia de San Francisco terminar su gigantesca labor en sólo dos meses.\n\nLa existencia de las Naciones Unidas no se inició al firmarse la Carta. En muchos países ésta tuvo que ser sometida a la aprobación de sus respectivos congresos o parlamentos. Se había convenido en que la Carta entraría en efecto cuando la hubiesen ratificado los gobiernos de China, Francia, Gran Bretaña, la Unión Soviética, los Estados Unidos y la mayoría de los demás países signatarios, y cuando estos hubiesen notificado del hecho al departamento de estado de los Estados Unidos. El 24 de octubre de 1945 se habían llenado los requisitos, y las Naciones Unidas comenzaron a funcionar. Los proyectos de cuatro años y las esperanzas de muchos siglos acababan de cristalizar en una organización internacional encaminada a acabar con la guerra y promover la paz y la justicia y una vida mejor para toda la humanidad."}

With nine league championships and twelve Norwegian Cup wins, FFK is one of the most successful clubs in Norwegian football. The club was founded in 1903 and currently play in Eliteserien from 2024 after promotion from Norwegian First Division in 2023.\n\nAfter suffering relegation from the then 1st division in 1984, Fredrikstad spent 18 years outside the top flight, before returning to the top division in 2004 after two successive promotions.\n\nFredrikstad stadion was FFK's home ground between 1914 and 2006. However, its facilities were outdated and the club moved to a new stadium on the other side of river Glomma. Their new ground is located in a former shipyard, incorporating parts of the old buildings in the two side stands. FFK draw great support from their area and the official supporter club's name is Plankehaugen. More than 100 coaches filled with fans followed FFK to the cup final of 2006. The club's supporters include an Ultras section, Supras Fredrikstad. The club had for some years a casual mob, Brigade Rød-Hvit (Brigade Red - White) which was active in the hooligan scene in Norway.\n\nFredrikstad Fotballklubb was founded on 7 April 1903. While football in many older clubs was an addition to other established forms of sport, such as skiing or athletics, FFK was the first club in Norway to focus uniquely on playing football, and as such may be labeled the first true football club in the country. A lack of opposition meant this was in fact the third attempt at establishing a football club in Fredrikstad (tradition has it that the second attempt died out when the only football landed on a freight train bound for Moss). Finding someone in the vicinity to play against was still a problem when FFK was founded.\n\nIt so happened that the Englishman H. W. Kenworthy, who lived in the neighboring town of Sarpsborg, wanted to practice his native country's sport and traveled to Fredrikstad to take part in one of FFK's training sessions. Upon his return to Sarpsborg, it was suggested that he arrange for a new club to be established. The idea was well received in Sarpsborg, and Sarpsborg F.C. was founded on 8 May 1903. The first match between the teams was played the following year in Sarpsborg in front of 600 spectators. FFK won the historical match 4–0. Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad went on to establish the first regional series and inspired the founding of many new clubs in the region in the years to come.\n\nFFK didn't have the red and white colors when the club was founded in 1903. In fact, they changed suits seven times from 1903 to 1927. The colors that they wear now come from Polish National team. When FFK asked Polish Football Association if they could use their colours, they received positive reply and even set of clothes in the colours as a gift.\n\nFFK reached the Norwegian Cup final for the first time in 1932. The semifinal against Mjøndalen was played at home in front of a record 9,000 spectators, and FFK won the match 3–0. Fredrikstad met Ørn Horten in the final, winning 6–1, and were thus Norwegian Champions. This signaled the start of Fredrikstad's first successful era, in which the club claimed four more cup titles before the start of World War II. FFK became the first club to win the new nationwide league, in 1937–38, and they won The Double the following season.\n\nIn the 1930s, the club also had an active bandy department.[2]\n\nDuring the German occupation no organized football took place, as a result of all athletes going on strike in support of the resistance. After the war football was more popular than ever, and Fredrikstad set another attendance record against Sarpsborg in the semifinal of the 1945 Norwegian Cup. There was, however, little success on the pitch. FFK reached three cup finals in four years but lost all of them. The break came in 1949 when FFK won its third league title.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were highly successful years for FFK. The club secured the league title six times – back to back in 1950–51 and 1951–52 – and finished in second place seven times. The Norwegian Cup was won four times. In 1957, a new milestone was achieved when FFK won their second double. As league champions in 1960, Fredrikstad entered the European Cup as the first team from Norway, sensationally defeating Ajax 4–3 at home and drawing 0–0 in Amsterdam, in the first round.\n\nThe town of Fredrikstad was in many ways an economic powerhouse in Norway in the previous century, first as a major supplier of machinery to the timber industry and then as a center of shipbuilding activities. At one point the shipyard in Fredrikstad was the largest in Scandinavia. It has been said that there was always an air of optimism surrounding the town and its inhabitants, and it was certainly reflected in FFK's playful and relaxed style of football, which many regarded as the most entertaining in the country. The club's first cup triumph in '32 even made Jørgen Juve, a legend in Norwegian football, state: \"This is how football is supposed to be played.\"\n\nPerhaps it was because of this relaxed atmosphere that the club was so successful, and also why it eventually fell into decline. After years of glory, the club was becoming conservative, although they would not admit it themselves. Other clubs were increasingly turning to professionalism, while players from FFK still played football in addition to having normal jobs. Training regimes were becoming more rigorous than before, but in Fredrikstad, they felt that training more than twice a week would ruin the joy of playing football. There is also the sentiment that, in light of the club's formidable history, newer generations of FFK players were given too much responsibility, folding to the pressure again and again whenever things were starting to look brighter.\n\nFredrikstad was to struggle throughout the 1970s. They reached the cup final in 1971 but lost to Rosenborg, who was by now firmly en route to becoming a giant in Norwegian football. In 1972, they were runners-up in the league to Viking FK only on goal difference, as both teams finished the season on 34 points.[3] In 1973, for the first time in the club's history, FFK was relegated. They immediately gained promotion via the playoffs and by 1975 were back in the highest division, where they stayed for two seasons before facing relegation yet again.\n\nThe elevator ride between divisions continued until 1984. The Norwegian Cup went to Fredrikstad that year, but it must have been a bittersweet success. The club was once again relegated, and this time they were unable to make it back to the top flight. In 1992, FFK was relegated to the third highest division, where they would languish until 2002.\n\nFredrikstad's comeback from obscurity is largely attributed to the manager Knut Torbjørn Eggen, who introduced a degree of professionalism the club had previously lacked. During his tenure, from 2001 until the end of 2006, the son of Rosenborg's successful former coach led the team to their first title in more than two decades. In 2002, they were promoted from the 2. divisjon to the 1. divisjon, and in 2003, their centenary year, Fredrikstad finished second, earning promotion to the top division. Although struggling to maintain their form through an entire season, Fredrikstad has managed to retain their spot three times, and in 2006 they won the Norwegian Cup for the eleventh time in their history. They came 2nd and won silver in the 2008 season, but were relegated after a poor season in 2009 to 1. division. They eventually got promoted back to Tippeligaen through playoffs in November 2010 by first beating Løv-Ham 2–0, then Hønefoss BK with a stunning 8–1 goal difference over two matches.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, the offices of the club were raided by Norwegian police in connection with the Raio Piiroja contract investigations[4]\n\nAfter their relegation from the Eliteserien in 2012, Fredrikstad spent time in the Obos-Ligaen (2012-2017, 2021-2023) and PostNord-ligaen (2018-2020) before earning promotion back to the Eliteserien in 2024 under new manager Mikkjal Thomassen.\n\nIn the early years of the club, Fredrikstad changed attire quite frequently. The first kit, for example, consisted of blue and white striped shirts and black shorts, but was changed after only two years, to white shirts and blue shorts. In 1910, a green and white kit was adopted ahead of the club's first semifinal in the Norwegian Cup.\n\nThe seventh and final iteration of Fredrikstad's kit was introduced after a match between Norway and Poland at Fredrikstad stadion, on 7 October 1926. Fredrikstad would request of the Polish Football Association that they use the Polish national colors for the Polish national team:\n\nThe club received from the Polish association the new kit on 17 March 1927, when it became the official colors of Fredrikstad. The kit has since changed little in appearance apart from the socks, which went from being red and white to purely white in 1997.\n\nFFK's badge, a green and white streamer with a football and the initials F.F. (the original abbreviation for Fredrikstad Fotballklubb was F.F.), has remained virtually unchanged since its introduction in 1909. When the Fredrikstad kit changed to white and red, the colors of the streamer changed as well.\n\nThe old Fredrikstad stadion was inaugurated in 1914 and was the first stadium in Norway with floodlighting. FFK's record attendance was set in 1956 against Larvik Turn. 15,534 spectators showed up for this quarter-final match of the Norwegian Cup. The stadium's last renovation occurred ahead of the 2004 season, putting the capacity at around 10,500.\n\nA new home ground was built for the 2007 season at Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted (colloquially known as \"Værste\"), an old shipyard in the center of Fredrikstad. This was once the largest shipyard in Scandinavia, and the architecture of the stadium is such that two of the now defunct mechanical workshops, dating from as far back as 1870, are converted into stands at the sides. In addition, two separate stands are built at the ends of the pitch. The new stadium (with the same name, Fredrikstad stadion) has an all-seater capacity of 12,550.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

The British defeated the Continental Army and gained access to the strategically important Port of New York, which they held for the rest of the war. It was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia. It was the largest battle of the Revolutionary War in terms of both troop deployment and combat.\n\nAfter defeating the British in the siege of Boston on March 17, Continental Army commander-in-chief George Washington relocated his army to defend the port city of New York, located at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the Royal Navy, so he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack. In July, the British, under the command of General William Howe, landed a few miles across the harbor on the sparsely populated Staten Island, where they were reinforced by a fleet of ships in Lower New York Bay over the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and accordingly moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that it would be the first target.\n\nOn August 21, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south of the established East River crossings to Manhattan. After five days of waiting, the British attacked the American defenses on the Guan Heights. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and capture, although a stand by 400 Maryland and Delaware troops prevented greater losses. The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege, but on the night of August 29–30, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life. The Continental Army was driven out of Manhattan entirely after several more defeats and was forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the first stage of the war, the British Army was trapped in the peninsular city of Boston and were forced to abandon it on March 17, sailing to Halifax, Nova Scotia, to await reinforcements.[7] Washington then began to transfer regiments to New York City, which he believed the British would attack next because of the port's strategic importance.[8][9] He had sent his second-in-command, Charles Lee, ahead to New York the previous February to establish the city's defenses.[10] Washington left Boston on April 4, arrived in New York on April 13,[11] and established headquarters at the former home of Archibald Kennedy on Broadway facing Bowling Green.\n\nLee remained in New York City until March when the Continental Congress sent him to South Carolina; construction of the city's defenses was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling).[11] Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete,[12] but Lee had concluded that in any case, it would be impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located with the ability to inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground.[10] Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling was built across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city.[13] Lee had also seen to it that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.[14]\n\nWashington began moving troops to Brooklyn in early May,[15] and there were several thousand of them there in a short time. Three more forts were under construction on the eastern side of the East River to support Fort Stirling, which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights. These new fortifications were Fort Putnam,[16] Fort Greene,[16] and Fort Box[16] (named for Major Daniel Box).[17] They lay from north to south, with Fort Putnam farthest to the north, Greene slightly to the southwest, and Box slightly farther southwest. Each of these defensive structures was surrounded by a large ditch, all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons.[18]\n\nFort Defiance was also being constructed at this time, located farther southwest, past Fort Box, near present-day Red Hook.[17] In addition to these new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green on Manhattan, and more cannons were placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River.[19] Hulks were sunk at strategic locations to deter the British from entering the East River and other waterways.[20]\n\nWashington had been authorized by Congress to recruit an army of up to 28,501 troops, but he had only 19,000 when he reached New York.[21] Military discipline was inadequate; routine orders were not carried out, muskets were fired in camp, flints were ruined, bayonets were used as knives to cut food, and firearm readiness was lax.[22] Petty internal conflict was common under the strain of a large number of people from different regional cultures and temperaments living in relatively close proximity.[23]\n\nCommander of the artillery Henry Knox persuaded Washington to transfer 400 to 500 soldiers, who lacked muskets or guns, to crew the artillery.[19] In early June, Knox and General Nathanael Greene inspected the land at the north end of Manhattan and decided to establish Fort Washington. Fort Constitution, later renamed Fort Lee, was planned opposite Fort Washington on the Hudson River.[19] The forts were intended to discourage the British ships from sailing up the Hudson River.[19]\n\nOn June 28, General Washington learned that the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and was heading toward New York.[24] On June 29, signals were sent from men stationed on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay.[25] The population of New York went into a panic at the sight of the British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts.[25] On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The Continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.[26] Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island under the command of Richard Howe, the brother of General Howe.[26]\n\nOn July 6, news reached New York that Congress had voted for independence four days earlier.[27] On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons of the city to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain.[28] In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, and the rest of the statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.[29]\n\nOn July 12, the British ships Phoenix and Rose sailed up the harbor toward the mouth of the Hudson.[29] The American batteries opened fire from the harbor defenses of Fort George, Fort Defiance, and Governors Island, but the British returned fire into the city. The ships sailed along the New Jersey shore and continued up the Hudson, sailing past Fort Washington and arriving by nightfall at Tarrytown, the widest part of the Hudson.[30] The goals of the British ships were to cut off American supplies from New England and the north and to encourage Loyalist support. The only casualties of the day were six Americans who were killed when their own cannon blew up.[30]\n\nThe next day, July 13, Howe attempted to open negotiations with the Americans.[31] He sent a letter to Washington delivered by Lieutenant Philip Brown, who arrived under a flag of truce. The letter was addressed to \"George Washington, Esq.\"[31] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no.[32] Reed told Brown that there was no one in the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address \"George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.\", but it was again declined.[33] The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20.[33] Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, \"Those who have committed no fault want no pardon.\"[33] Patterson departed soon after.[33] Washington's performance during the meeting was praised in many parts of the country.[34]\n\nMeanwhile, British ships continued to arrive.[35] On August 1, 45 ships arrived with generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis, along with 3,000 troops. By August 12, 3,000 more British troops and another 8,000 Hessians had arrived.[36] At this point, the British fleet numbered over 400 ships, including 73 warships, and 32,000 troops were camped on Staten Island. Faced with this large force, Washington was unsure as to where the British would attack.[37] Both Greene and Reed thought that the British would attack Long Island, but Washington felt that a British attack on Long Island might be a diversion for the main attack on Manhattan. He broke his army in half, stationing half of it on Manhattan, and the other half on Long Island; the army on Long Island was commanded by Greene.[37] On August 20, Greene became ill and was forced to move to a house in Manhattan where he rested to recover. John Sullivan was placed in command until Greene was well enough to resume command.[38]\n\nAt 05:10 on August 22, an advance guard of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island under the command of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island.[39] At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been stationed on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way.[40] By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the advance guard, advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.[40][41]\n\nWashington received word of the landings the same day but was informed that the number was 8,000 to 9,000 troops.[42] This convinced him that it was the feint that he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1,500 more troops to Brooklyn, bringing the total number of troops on Long Island to 6,000. On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the troops on Long Island.[43] Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day, the British troops on Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000.[44] There was little fighting on the days immediately after the landing, although some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.[45]\n\nThe American plan was for Putnam to direct the defenses from Brooklyn Heights, while Sullivan and Stirling and their troops would be stationed forward on the Guan Heights.[46][47] The Guan (hills) were up to 150 feet high and blocked the most direct route to Brooklyn Heights.[46][47] Washington believed that, by stationing men on the heights, heavy casualties could be inflicted on the British before the troops fell back to the main defenses at Brooklyn Heights.[48] There were three main passes through the heights; the Gowanus Road farthest to the west, the Flatbush Road slightly farther to the east, in the center of the American line where it was expected that the British would attack, and the Bedford Pass even further to the east. Stirling was responsible for defending the Gowanus Road with 500 men, and Sullivan was to defend the Flatbush and Bedford roads where there were 1,000 and 800 men respectively.[46] Six-thousand troops were to remain behind at Brooklyn Heights. There was one lesser-known path through the heights called the Jamaica Pass, farthest to the east, which was patrolled by just five militia officers on horseback.[49]\n\nOn the British side, General Clinton learned of the almost undefended Jamaica Pass from local Loyalists.[50] He drew up a plan and gave it to William Erskine to propose to Howe. Clinton's plan had the main army making a night march and going through the Jamaica Pass to turn the American flank, while other troops would keep the Americans busy in front.[51] On August 26, Clinton received word from Howe that the plan would be used, and that Clinton was to command the advance guard of the main army of 10,000 men on the march through the Jamaica Pass. While they made the night march, General James Grant's British troops along with some Hessians, a total of 4,000 men, were to attack the Americans in front to distract them from the main army coming on their flank.[51] Howe told Clinton to be ready to move out that night, August 26.[51]\n\nAt 21:00, the British moved out.[52] No one except the commanders knew of the plan. Clinton led a crack brigade of light infantry with fixed bayonets in front, followed by Cornwallis who had eight battalions and 14 artillery pieces. Cornwallis was followed by Howe and Hugh Percy with six battalions, more artillery, and baggage.[52] The column consisted of 10,000 men who stretched out over two miles. Three Loyalist farmers led the column toward the Jamaica Pass. The British had left their campfires burning to deceive the Americans into thinking that nothing was happening.[52] The column headed northeast until it reached what later became the village of New Lots, when it headed directly north toward the heights.\n\nThe column had yet to run into any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as \"Howard's Half-Way House\"), just a few hundred yards from the Jamaica Pass.[53] Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). William Howard Jr. describes meeting Howe:\n\n\n\nFive minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia officers stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the British were Americans.[54] Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the British were through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest.[54] At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.[54]\n\nAt about 23:00 on August 26, the first shots were fired in the Battle of Long Island, near the Red Lion Inn (near present-day 39th Street and 4th Avenue). American pickets from Samuel John Atlee's Pennsylvania regiment fired upon two British soldiers who were foraging in a watermelon patch near the inn.[56]\n\nAround 01:00 on August 27, the British approached the vicinity of the Red Lion with 200–300 troops. The American troops fired upon the British; after approximately two fusillades, they fled up the Gowanus Road toward the Vechte–Cortelyou House. Major Edward Burd had been in command, but he was captured along with a lieutenant and 15 privates.[57] This first engagement was fought in the vicinity of 38th and 39th streets between 2nd and 3rd avenues near a swamp located adjacent to the Gowanus Road.\n\nBrigadier General Samuel Holden Parsons and Colonel Atlee were stationed farther north on the Gowanus Road. Parsons was a lawyer from Connecticut who had recently secured a commission in the Continental Army; Atlee was a veteran of the French and Indian War in command of the First Regiment of Pennsylvania Musketry. Putnam had been awakened by a guard at 03:00 and told that the British were attacking through the Gowanus Pass.[59] He lit signals to Washington, who was on Manhattan, and then rode south to warn Stirling of the attack.[60]\n\nStirling led two units of Colonel John Haslet's 1st Delaware Regiment under the immediate command of Major Thomas Macdonough, and Colonel William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Infantry under the immediate command of Major Mordecai Gist; both Haslet and Smallwood were on courts-martial duty in Manhattan. Following close behind was Parson's Connecticut regiment with 251 men. Stirling led this combined force to reinforce Parsons and Atlee and stop the British advance. Stirling had a total of 1,600 troops at his command.[citation needed]\n\nStirling placed Atlee's men in an apple orchard owned by Wynant Bennett on the south side of the Gowanus Road near present-day 3rd Avenue and 18th Street. Upon the approach of the British, the Americans:\n\nStirling took up positions with the Delaware and Maryland regiments just to the north of Atlee's men on the slopes of a rise of land between 18th and 20th streets. Some of the Maryland troops were positioned on a small hill near today's 23rd Street, which the local Dutch called \"Blokje Berg\" (Dutch for cube or block hill). At the base of this hill, the Gowanus Road crossed a small bridge over a ditch which drained a marshy area. When the British advanced up the Gowanus Road, the American troops fired upon them from positions on the north side of the ditch. To their left was Colonel Peter Kachline's Pennsylvania regiment.\n\nJust to the southeast of Blokje Berg were a few hills; amongst them was a hill which is the highest point in King's County at 220 feet which came to be known as \"Battle Hill,\" in what is today Greenwood Cemetery by the cemetery's boundary of 23rd Street and 7th Avenue. The British attempted to outflank the American positions by taking this hill. The Americans tried to prevent the British move, sending troops under Parsons and Atlee to take the hill. The British got there first but the Americans were able to dislodge them in fierce fighting. Battle Hill was the site of especially brutal fighting, with the Americans inflicting the highest number of casualties against the British troops during the entire Battle of Long Island. Among those killed was British Colonel James Grant, which led the Americans to believe that they had killed General James Grant. He was alleged to have been shot by a Pennsylvanian rifleman who had been sniping at the British from up in a tree. Among the American dead was Pennsylvania Colonel Caleb Parry, who was killed while rallying his troops.\n\nThe Americans were still unaware that this was not the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the fighting and the number of British troops engaged.[63]\n\nThe Hessians, in the center under the command of General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines stationed at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan.[64] The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who were in the process of outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.\n\nHowe fired his signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear.[64] Sullivan left his advance guard to hold off the Hessians while he turned the rest of his force around to fight the British. Heavy casualties mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear.[64] Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed.[65] Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. It was later claimed that Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians.[66] Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.[65]\n\nAt 09:00, Washington arrived from Manhattan.[67] He realized that he had been wrong about a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan.[67] His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.[68]\n\nStirling still held the line against Grant on the American right, to the west.[68] He held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver, and some of his own troops thought that they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians.[66][68] Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, from the south up the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, where the American defenses on Brooklyn Heights lay on the other side.[69]\n\nStirling ordered all of his troops to cross the creek, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Gist. This group became known to history as the \"Maryland 400\", although they numbered about 260–270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops, which surpassed 2,000 supported by two cannons.[69] Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British, who were in fixed positions inside and in front of the Vechte–Cortelyou House (known today as the \"Old Stone House\"). After the last assault, the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud and under musket fire, and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through their lines to von Heister's Hessians and surrendered to them. Two hundred fifty six Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House, and fewer than a dozen made it back to the American lines.[70] Washington watched from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill (intersection of today's Court Street and Atlantic Avenue) and reportedly said, \"Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose.\"[69][note 1]\n\nContinental Army troops who were not killed or captured escaped behind the fortified American position at Brooklyn Heights. Howe then ordered all of his troops to halt the attack, despite the protests of many officers in his command who believed that they should push on to Brooklyn Heights. Howe had decided against a direct frontal assault on the entrenched American positions, choosing instead to begin a siege and setting up lines of circumvallation around the American positions. He believed the Americans to be essentially trapped, with his troops blocking escape by land and the Royal Navy in control of the East River, which they would have to cross to reach Manhattan Island.[71][72]\n\nHowe's failure to press the attack and the reasons for it have been disputed. He may have wished to avoid the casualties that his army suffered when attacking the Continentals under similar circumstances at the Battle of Bunker Hill.[72] He may also have been giving Washington an opportunity to conclude that his position was hopeless and surrender, in the European gentleman-officer tradition. Howe told Parliament in 1779 that his essential duty was to avoid excessive British casualties for insufficient purpose, and capturing Brooklyn Heights would likely not have meant capturing the entire American army. \"The most essential duty I had to observe was, not wantonly to commit his majesty's troops, where the object was inadequate. I knew well that any considerable loss sustained by the army could not speedily, nor easily, be repaired. . . . The loss of 1,000, or perhaps 1,500 British troops, in carrying those lines, would have been but ill repaid by double that number of the enemy, could it have been supposed they would have suffered in that proportion.\"[73]\n\nWashington and the Continental Army were surrounded on Brooklyn Heights with the East River to their backs.[74] As the day went on, the British began to dig trenches, slowly coming closer to the American defenses. By doing this, the British would not have to cross over open ground to assault the American defenses as they did in Boston the year before.[75] Despite this perilous situation, Washington ordered 1,200 more men from Manhattan to Brooklyn on August 28,[74] and two Pennsylvania regiments and Colonel John Glover's regiment from Marblehead, Massachusetts responded to Washington, sending troops. Thomas Mifflin, who commanded the Pennsylvania troops after arriving, volunteered to inspect the outer defenses and report back to Washington.[76] In these outer defenses, small skirmishes were still taking place. On the afternoon of August 28, rain began to fall, and Washington had his cannons bombard the British well into the night.[77]\n\nAs the rain continued, Washington sent a letter instructing General William Heath, who was at Kings Bridge over the Harlem River between Manhattan and what is now The Bronx, to send every flat-bottomed boat and sloop without delay, in case battalions of infantry from New Jersey came to reinforce their position.[78] At 16:00, on August 29, Washington held a meeting with his generals. Mifflin advised Washington to retreat to Manhattan while Mifflin and his Pennsylvania regiments made up the rear guard, holding the line until the rest of the army had withdrawn.[78] The generals agreed unanimously with Mifflin that retreat was the best option and Washington had orders go out by the evening.[79]\n\nThe troops were told that they were to gather up all their ammunition and baggage and prepare for a night attack.[79] By 21:00, the sick and wounded began to move to the Brooklyn Ferry in preparation for evacuation. At 23:00, Glover and his Massachusetts men, who were sailors and fishermen, began to evacuate the troops.[80]\n\nAs more troops were evacuated, more were ordered to withdraw from the lines and march to the ferry landing. Wagon wheels were muffled, and men were forbidden to talk.[80] Mifflin's rear guard was tending campfires to deceive the British. At 04:00, on August 30, Mifflin was informed that it was his unit's turn to evacuate.[82] Mifflin told the man who had been sent to order him to leave, Major Alexander Scammell, that he must be mistaken, but Scammell insisted that he was not and Mifflin ordered his troops to move out. When Mifflin's troops were within a half mile of the ferry landing, Washington rode up and demanded to know why they were not at their defenses. Edward Hand, who was leading the troops, tried to explain what had happened, but Mifflin arrived shortly.[83] Washington exclaimed \"Good God. General Mifflin, I am afraid you have ruined us.\" Mifflin explained that he had been told that it was his turn to evacuate by Scammell; Washington told him it had been a mistake. Mifflin then led his troops back to the outer defenses.[83]\n\nArtillery, supplies, and troops were all being evacuated across the river at this time but it was not going as fast as Washington had anticipated and daybreak soon came.[83] A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there did not seem to be any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat.[75] At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan.[84] All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.[84]\n\nThe British were stunned to find that Washington and the Continental Army had escaped.[84] Later that day, on August 30, British troops occupied Washington and the Continental Army's fortifications. When news of the battle reached London, it led to many celebratory festivities.[85] Bells were rung across the city, candles were lit in windows, and King George III awarded Howe the Order of the Bath.[86]\n\nWashington's defeat, in the opinions of some, revealed his deficiencies as a military strategist. Splitting his forces resulted in his largely inexperienced generals misunderstanding the state of the battle, and his raw troops fled in disorder at the first shots.[87] However, Washington and the Continental Army's daring retreat later that night has been seen by some historians as one of General Washington's greatest military accomplishments.[20] Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.[88]\n\nHowe remained inactive for the next half month, not attacking until September 15 when he landed a force at Kip's Bay.[89] The British quickly occupied the city. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington.[90] Because of these defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.[91] On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, Nathan Hale was executed for spying.\n\nAt the time, it was by far the largest battle ever fought in North America.[71] If the Royal Navy is included, over 40,000 men took part in the battle. Howe reported his losses as 59 killed, 268 wounded and 31 missing. The Hessian casualties were 5 killed and 26 wounded.[4] The Americans suffered much heavier losses. About 300 had been killed and over 1,000 captured.[6] As few as half of the prisoners survived. Kept on prison ships in Wallabout Bay, then transferred to locations such as the Middle Dutch Church, they were starved and denied medical attention. In their weakened condition, many succumbed to smallpox.[92]: 191\n\nHistorians believe that as many as 256 soldiers of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years.\n\nThe most significant legacy of the Battle of Long Island was that it showed there would be no easy victory, and that the war would be long and bloody.[92]: 2 The British took control of the strategically vital harbor and put New York City under military occupation until the treaty ending the war was signed. With the British military command in residence the city became the focal point for espionage and intelligence gathering. The area surrounding the city and the harbor remained in a near-constant state of conflict as a forage-war harassed the surrounding communities.\n• The Altar to Liberty: Minerva monument: The battle is commemorated with a monument, which includes a bronze statue of Minerva near the top of Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery. The statue was sculpted by Frederick Ruckstull and unveiled in 1920. The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to the Statue of Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument. 93\n• The Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument: A freestanding Doric column in Fort Greene memorializing all those who died while kept prisoner on the British ships just off the shore of Brooklyn, in Wallabout Bay. 94\n• Soldiers' Monument – Milford, Connecticut. Memorializes the 200 seriously ill prisoners of the Battle of Long Island who were dumped on the beach at Milford the night of January 3, 1777. 92\n• The Old Stone House: A re-constructed farmhouse (c.1699) that was at the center of the Marylanders' delaying actions serves as a museum of the battle. It is located in J.J. Byrne Park, at Third Street and Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, and features models and maps. 95\n• Prospect Park, Brooklyn, Battle Pass: along the eastern side of East Drive is a large granite boulder with a brass plaque affixed, and another marker lies near the road for the Dongan Oak, a very large and old tree felled to block the pass from the British advance. In addition, in the park resides the Line of Defense marker erected by the Sons of the American Revolution and, near the eastern edge of Long Meadow, the Maryland Monument & Maryland Memorial corinthian column. 96\n\nThere are currently 30 existing units in the U.S. Army with lineages that go back to the colonial and revolutionary eras. Five Army National Guard units (101st Eng Bn,[97] 125th MP Co,[98] 175th Inf,[99] 181st Inf[100] and 198th Sig Bn)[101] and one Regular Army Field Artillery battalion (1–5th FA)[102] are derived from American units that participated in the Battle of Long Island.\n• American Revolutionary War §British New York counter-offensive.

En la Guerra de Independencia de Estados Unidos fue la primera gran batalla sucedida después que los estadounidenses proclamaran su independencia el 4 de julio de ese mismo año. Además, fue el mayor enfrentamiento de todo el conflicto.\n\nDespués de vencer a los británicos en el sitio de Boston el 17 de marzo, el comandante en jefe, general George Washington, llevó a su ejército a defender Nueva York, ubicada en el extremo sur de la isla de Manhattan. Washington entiende que el puerto de la ciudad sería una excelente base para la Royal Navy durante la campaña. Para impedirlo estableció defensas y esperó el ataque inglés. En julio, los británicos, comandados por el general William Howe, desembarcaron a pocos kilómetros del puerto, en la poco poblada Staten Island, donde un mes y medio después, reforzado por barcos de la bahía de Nueva York, reunió una fuerza de 32 000 hombres y 400 navíos —73 buques de guerra—.[5]​ Con el apoyo naval de su flota, Howe controló el acceso al puerto bloqueando The Narrows. Washington sabía que con esto le sería muy difícil retener la ciudad. Creyendo que Manhattan sería el primer objetivo movió al grueso de sus fuerzas de sus posiciones.\n\nEl 22 de agosto, los británicos desembarcaron en las playas de la bahía de Gravesend, al suroeste del condado de Kings County, pasando a través de The Narrows. Después de cinco días de espera atacaron las defensas norteamericanas de las alturas de Guan. Sin conocimiento de los estadounidenses, Howe había conseguido llevar a la mayoría de su tropa alrededor de un flanco y una retirada para atacar por sorpresa poco después. Los revolucionarios entraron en pánico, lo que provocó un 20 % de bajas entre sus fuerzas. Aunque la resistencia de 400 soldados de Maryland impidió que el grueso del Ejército Continental fuera capturado. El resto de las fuerzas estadounidenses se retiró a las alturas de Brooklyn. Mientras los británicos se preparaban para asediarlos, durante la noche del 29 al 30 de agosto, Washington evacuó a todo el ejército desde Manhattan sin perder sus suministros ni una sola vida.\n\nDe cualquier modo, Washington y su ejército habían sido expulsados de Nueva York completamente tras sufrir numerosas derrotas, debiendo retirarse a través de Nueva Jersey a Pensilvania. Nueva York se convirtió efectivamente en el centro político-militar británico para sus operaciones durante la guerra. Poco después se produjo la ejecución de Nathan Hale y pérdida de casi un cuarto de los edificios de la ciudad en el Gran Incendio. En las semanas siguientes, las fuerzas británicas ocuparon Long Island, pero Washington y sus hombres consiguieron recuperar la posición.\n• Wikimedia Commons alberga una categoría multimedia sobre Batalla de Long Island."}

Es tracta de famílies que presenten una gran diversitat i variació. Pel que fa al nombre d’espècies que les compo­nen, es poden trobar des de famílies molt grans, com els tirànids (tirà cardenal comú) o els furnàrids (cuaespinós bicolor), amb més de 400 i 300 espècies respectivament, fins a famílies monotípiques, repre­sentades únicament per un gènere i una espècie, com és el cas dels sapayoids (sapaioa), els ragològids (xiuladora pigallada) o els eupètids (eupeta). Pel que fa a la mida, tot i que els passeriformes solen ser ocells de dimensions petites, com l’acantisita bec d’alena, d’uns 8 cm de llargada, o el manaquí barbat collblanc, amb 11 cm aproximada­ment, també hi ha excepcions com el picatarta collblanc, d’uns 41 cm, o l’ocell lira superb, que pot arribar fins al metre de llargada.\n\nCadascuna de les famílies d’aquesta infografia s’il·lustra amb la imatge d’una espècie representativa i el nom científic i la denominació catalana corresponents.\n\nCada imatge ofereix un enllaç a l’entrada corresponent del Diccionari dels ocells del món, un projecte disponible en línia des de l’any 2017, que permet la consulta de més de 8.000 fitxes terminològiques corresponents a totes les espècies d’ocells no passeriformes i a les espècies de 85 famílies d’ocells passeriformes.\n\nEs tracta d’una obra en curs d’elaboració que s’amplia progressivament a mesura que avança el treball de validació de les denominacions catalanes de les espècies de la cinquantena de famílies d’ocells passeriformes actualment en curs de revisió.\n\nAquesta infografia interactiva, que es preveu ampliar més endavant amb la publicació d’una segona part que inclourà la resta de famílies de passeriformes, també es pot consultar o imprimir en format pòster.\n\nOcells passeriformes (1) s'afegeix al centenar de productes multimèdia que el TERMCAT ofereix amb la voluntat d'afavorir la difusió de la terminologia dels diferents àmbits d'especialitat, entre els quals cal destacar, en el camp de l’ornitologia: Ocells no passeriformes, L’anar i venir dels ocells: els ocells migradors, Ocells marins: un tresor en perill i Ocells amb nom de dona.Inicio: La Fundación para el Desarrollo Integrado Sustentable (FUDIS), es una organización creada en 1997, que se enfoca en propiciar bienestar social, económico y ambiental en la sociedad.Red fody - Wikipedia: The red fody (Foudia madagascariensis), also known as the Madagascar fody in Madagascar, red cardinal fody in Mauritius, or common fody, is a small bird native to Madagascar and introduced to various other islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a common bird within its restricted range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \"least concern\".\n\nIn 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the red fody in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Madagascar. He used the French name Le cardinal de Madagascar and the Latin Cardinalis Madagascariensis.[2] Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature.[3] When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson.[3] One of these was the red fody. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Loxia madagascariensis and cited Brisson's work.[4] This species is now placed in the genus Foudia that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850.[5] The type species was subsequently designated as the red fody.[6] The species is monotypic.[7]\n\nThe red fody is about 5 inches (13 cm) in length and weighs 14–19 grams (0.49–0.67 oz). The male of the species is bright red with black markings around each eye. Its wings and tail are brown. Its underparts are also red, which distinguishes it from other fodies in areas where it has been introduced. The female fody's upper parts are olive-brown and its underparts are greyish brown.[8]\n\nIt is a common bird found in forest clearings, grasslands and cultivated areas, but not in dense forest. In Madagascar it is regarded as a pest of rice cultivation. It has been introduced to other areas of the Indian Ocean, included the Amirantes, Comoros, Seychelles, Mauritius, Réunion and Saint Helena.[8]\n\nThe red fody feeds largely on seeds, especially grass seeds, and insects, but several other foodstuffs are also taken; these include fruit, nectar, household scraps and copra.[8]\n\nOutside the breeding season, this bird is gregarious. As the breeding season approaches, males establish territories, about 30 m (100 ft) in diameter. The birds are monogamous, and the male starts building the nest in the centre of the territory before courtship commences, with nests being clustered together in loose colonies. The nest is globular with a side entrance and porch or short tube. It is constructed, mostly by the male, out of rootlets, tendrils, grasses and other long strands of vegetation, woven together. The nest takes around eight days to build, and many get abandoned if the male fails to attract a mate.[8]\n\nIn different parts of its introduced range, this species show different impacts on native birds. Both the endangered Mauritius fody (Foudia rubra) and the Rodrigues fody (Foudia flavicans) have been affected by the competition for resources on their respective islands.[9]Mauritius Fody (Foudia rubra) | Summary | BirdLife International: Click here for more information about the Red List categories and criteriaThis species is classified as Endangered because it has an extremely small population. The population has been stable since the early 1990s but then increased following an island translocation, and if it remains stable or increasing with over 250 mature individuals it may warrant downlisting to Vulnerable in the future.Fody - Wikipedia: Fodies are small passerine birds belonging to the genus Foudia in the weaver family Ploceidae.\n\nThe birds are 12 to 15 centimetres (4.7 to 5.9 in) long and have short, conical bills. Males in breeding plumage are usually colourful with bright red or yellow on the head and sometimes elsewhere. Non-breeding males and females are dull, sparrow-like birds with mostly grey-brown plumage.\n\nFodies are typically found in forest, woodland or scrubland but some also occur in man-made habitats, especially the red fody. Some species feed mainly on seeds while others are largely insectivorous. Fodies build a dome-shaped nest of grass and other plant material. It has a side-opening and it is suspended from a branch or palm leaf.\n\nThe genus was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1850.[2] The type species was subsequently designated as the red fody.[3]\n\nThe genus contains eight species:[4]\n\nThey are native to the islands of the western Indian Ocean where they occur on Madagascar, the Seychelles, the Comoro Islands and the Mascarene Islands. The red fody has also been introduced to the Chagos Archipelago, Bahrain and Saint Helena. While the red fody is one of the most common birds of the region, several of the other fodies are considered to be threatened, particularly the Mauritius fody which is classed as endangered.Reunion Fody (Foudia delloni) | Summary | BirdLife International: This species was endemic to the island of Réunion, where it was once described as abundant. It was last seen shortly after 1672 and was likely driven to extinction following the arrival of rats on the island. It is therefore classified as Extinct.0 mature individualsnoRed Fody - eBird: Sparrow-like weaver in which scarlet breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding females very drab. Found in virtually all habitats except the interior of thick forest. Often found in flocks, sometimes mixed with other birds. Calls are high, silvery notes, given in long series as a song. Can be very similar to Forest Fody. Breeding male Red Fody has red on the back and belly, though molting males can match the pattern of Forest Fody. Females and non-breeding males very similar, but Red Fody is paler and less greenish, with a smaller bill. Unlike Forest Fody, not found in the rainforest interior. Separated from female and non-breeding male Sakalava Weaver by smaller size, smaller bill, and different facial markings."}

Mantener refrigerado.\n\n* Imágenes referenciales sujeto a stock de decoración\n\n * Medidas referenciales y aproximadas sujetos a cambios imprevistosLes Misérables - Wikipedia: Les Misérables ( ,[4] French: [le mizeʁabl]) is a French epic historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published on 31 March 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century. Les Misérables has been popularized through numerous adaptations for film, television, and the stage, including a musical.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, the novel is usually referred to by its original French title. However, several alternatives have been used, including The Miserables, The Wretched, The Miserable Ones, The Poor Ones, The Wretched Poor, The Victims, and The Dispossessed.[5] Beginning in 1815 and culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, the novel follows the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict Jean Valjean and his experience of redemption.[6]\n\nExamining the nature of law and grace, the novel elaborates upon the history of France, the architecture and urban design of Paris, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion, and the types and nature of romantic and familial love.\n\nUpton Sinclair described the novel as \"one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world\" and remarked that Hugo set forth the purpose of Les Misérables in the preface:[7]\n\nTowards the end of the novel, Hugo explains the work's overarching structure:[8]\n\nThe novel contains various subplots, but the main thread is the story of ex-convict Jean Valjean, who becomes a force for good in the world but cannot escape his criminal past. The novel is divided into 5 volumes, each divided into several books and subdivided into chapters, for a total of 48 books and 365 chapters. Each chapter is relatively short, commonly no longer than a few pages.\n\nThe novel as a whole is one of the longest ever written,[9] with 655,478 words in the original French. Hugo explained his ambitions for the novel to his Italian publisher:\n\nMore than a quarter of the novel—by one count 955 of 2,783 pages—is devoted to essays that argue a moral point or display Hugo's encyclopedic knowledge but do not advance the plot, nor even a subplot, a method Hugo used in such other works as The Hunchback of Notre-Dame and Toilers of the Sea. One biographer noted, \"The digressions of genius are easily pardoned\".[11] The topics Hugo addresses include cloistered religious orders, the construction of the Paris sewers, argot, and the street urchins of Paris. The one about convents he titles \"Parenthesis\" to alert the reader to its irrelevance to the storyline.[12]\n\nHugo devotes another 19 chapters (Volume II, Book I) to an account—and meditation on the place in history—of the Battle of Waterloo, the battlefield of which Hugo visited in 1861 and where he finished writing the novel. It opens volume 2 with such a change of subject as to seem the beginning of an entirely different work. The fact that this \"digression\" occupies such a large part of the text demands that it be read in the context of the \"overarching structure\" discussed above. Hugo draws his own personal conclusions, taking Waterloo to be a pivot point in history but definitely not a victory for the forces of reaction.\n\nOne critic has called this \"the spiritual gateway\" to the novel, as its chance encounter of Thénardier and Colonel Pontmercy foreshadows so many of the novel's encounters \"blending chance and necessity\", a \"confrontation of heroism and villainy\".\n\nEven when not turning to other subjects outside his narrative, Hugo sometimes interrupts the straightforward recitation of events, his voice and control of the storyline unconstrained by time and sequence. The novel opens with a statement about the bishop of Digne in 1815 and immediately shifts: \"Although these details in no way essentially concern that which we have to tell...\" Only after 14 chapters does Hugo pick up the opening thread again, \"In the early days of the month of October, 1815...\", to introduce Jean Valjean.[14]\n\nAn incident Hugo witnessed in 1829 involved three strangers and a police officer. One of the strangers was a man who had stolen a loaf of bread, similar to Jean Valjean, being taken to the coach by a police officer. Nearby, two onlookers, a mother and daughter, had stopped to watch the thief. They became the inspiration for Fantine and Cosette. Hugo imagined the life of the man in jail and the mother and daughter taken away from each other.[15]\n\nValjean's character is loosely based on the life of the ex-convict Eugène François Vidocq. Vidocq became the head of an undercover police unit and later founded France's first private detective agency. He was also a businessman and was widely noted for his social engagement and philanthropy. Vidocq also inspired Hugo's \"Claude Gueux\" and Le Dernier jour d'un condamné (The Last Day of a Condemned Man).[16]\n\nIn 1828, Vidocq, already pardoned, saved one of the workers in his paper factory by lifting a heavy cart on his shoulders as Valjean does.[17] Hugo's description of Valjean rescuing a sailor on the Orion draws almost word for word on a Baron La Roncière's letter describing such an incident.[18] Hugo used Bienvenu de Miollis (1753–1843), the Bishop of Digne during the time in which Valjean encounters Myriel, as the model for Myriel.[19]\n\nHugo had used the departure of prisoners from the Bagne of Toulon in one of his early stories, Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamné. He went to Toulon to visit the Bagne in 1839 and took extensive notes, though he did not start writing the book until 1845. On one of the pages of his notes about the prison, he wrote in large block letters a possible name for his hero: \"JEAN TRÉJEAN\". When the book was finally written, Tréjean became Valjean.[20]\n\nIn 1841, Hugo saved a prostitute from arrest for assault. He used a short part of his dialogue with the police when recounting Valjean's rescue of Fantine in the novel.[21] On 22 February 1846, when he had begun work on the novel, Hugo witnessed the arrest of a bread thief while a duchess and her child watched the scene pitilessly from their coach.[22] He spent several vacations in Montreuil-sur-Mer.\n\nDuring the 1832 revolt, Hugo walked the streets of Paris, saw the barricades blocking his way at points, and had to take shelter from gunfire.[25]: 173–174 He participated more directly in the 1848 Paris insurrection, helping to smash barricades and suppress both the popular revolt and its monarchist allies.[25]: 273–276\n\nVictor Hugo drew his inspiration from everything he heard and saw, writing it down in his diary. In December 1846, he witnessed an altercation between an old woman scavenging through rubbish and a street urchin who might have been Gavroche.[26] He also informed himself by personal inspection of the Paris Conciergerie in 1846 and Waterloo in 1861, by gathering information on some industries, and on working-class people's wages and living standards. He asked his mistresses, Léonie d'Aunet and Juliette Drouet, to tell him about life in convents. He also slipped personal anecdotes into the plot. For instance, Marius and Cosette's wedding night (Part V, Book 6, Chapter 1) takes place on 16 February 1833, which is also the date when Hugo and his lifelong mistress Juliette Drouet made love for the first time.[27]\n\nA template for Hugo's novel was Les Mystères de Paris (The Mysteries of Paris), a serial novel of similar length that enjoyed great success on its appearance in 1842–43, by Eugène Sue. Les mystères, like Les Misérables, views contemporary Paris from the point of view of the downtrodden and criminal underclasses who had been little represented in novels up to the time and features the interventions of detectives and the indifference of aristocrats. Although socially progressive in tone, it is more sensationalist than Les Misérables and does not have the same breadth of moral vision.\n\nIn 1815 Digne, the peasant Jean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in the Bagne of Toulon—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\n\nDigne's benevolent Bishop Myriel gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his soul has been purchased for God and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\n\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-sou coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and panics, searching the city for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him because if he is apprehended, he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\n\nSix years pass, and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector Javert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\n\nYears earlier in Paris, a grisette named Fantine was very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle, were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomyès's daughter, Cosette. When Fantine arrives at Montfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of the Thénardiers, a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\n\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate, and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth and resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\n\nA dandy named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists, but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\n\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to Montreuil to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\n\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.\n\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned in the Bagne of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\n\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her while pampering their own daughters, Éponine and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to give Cosette a present of an expensive new doll, which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behavior, caring only that he pays for his food and lodging.\n\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately accepts while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back towards home.\n\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at the Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette, and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener, and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\nEight years later, the Friends of the ABC, led by Enjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanist civil unrest (i.e., the Paris uprising on 5–6 June 1832, a setting contrary to the popular notion that the book is set in the 1789 French Revolution)[28][29] following the death of Lamarque, a popular general known for his sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells. The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the Cour des miracles, including the Thénardiers' eldest son, Gavroche, who is a street urchin.\n\nOne of the students, Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially his royalist grandfather, M. Gillenormand) because of his Bonapartist views. After the death of his father, Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved his life at Waterloo—in reality, Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under Napoleon to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\n\nAt the Luxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname Jondrette at the Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.\n\nÉponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).\n\nThe philanthropist and his daughter—actually Valjean and Cosette—enter. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises to return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees. The Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid of Patron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\n\nMarius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him, revealing his true identity. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who saved his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\n\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, saying they will keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone and announces the address is a fake.\n\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier, and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\n\nHe arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (except Claquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison, and Montparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\nVolume IV: The Idyll in the Rue Plumet and the Epic in the Rue St. Denis\n\nAfter Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"the Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette, and Brujon manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche (a rare case of Gavroche helping his family in their criminal activities). One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean and Cosette's house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week, which greatly troubles the pair.\n\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the Champ de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap. It says, \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes home, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme-Armé, and restates that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses to consent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\n\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that he is a spy. When Enjolras confronts Javert about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius returns to Valjean and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet but finds it no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\n\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the revolution has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot him. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally wounding the man while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, and a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\n\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for him earlier calls him by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\n\nThe author also tells the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to having obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him but deciding to do so for fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\n\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is from Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still uncertain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot dead.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes Thénardier, but Thénardier doesn't recognize Valjean. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean's and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can determine his identity later. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer to distract the policeman who has been pursuing him.\n\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Surprisingly, Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks for a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window, he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but cannot ignore his duty to the law either. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.\n\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during Mardi Gras festivities, Valjean is spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius's judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\n\nThénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean by revealing all the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is a murderer and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then confronts Thénardier about his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America, where he becomes a slave trader.\n\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and reconcile with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n• Jean Valjean (also known as Monsieur Madeleine, Ultime Fauchelevent, Monsieur Leblanc, and Urbain Fabre) – The protagonist of the novel. He was born in Faverolles, Aisne. Convicted for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's seven starving children and sent to prison for five years, he is paroled from prison nineteen years later (after four unsuccessful escape attempts added twelve years and fighting back during the second escape attempt added two extra years). Rejected by society for being a former convict, he encounters Bishop Myriel, who turns his life around by showing him mercy and encouraging him to become a new man. While sitting and pondering what Bishop Myriel had said, he puts his shoe on a forty-sou piece dropped by a young wanderer. Valjean threatens the boy with his stick when the boy attempts to rouse him from his reverie and recover his money. He tells a passing priest his name and the name of the boy, which allows the police to charge him with armed robbery – a sentence that, if he were caught again, would return him to prison for life. He assumes a new identity (Monsieur Madeleine) in order to pursue an honest life. He introduces new manufacturing techniques and eventually builds two factories, becoming one of the richest men in the area. By popular acclaim, he is made mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. He confronts Javert over Fantine's punishment, turns himself in to the police to save another man from prison for life, and rescues Cosette from the Thénardiers. Discovered by Javert in Paris because of his generosity to the poor, he evades capture for the next several years in a convent. He saves Marius from imprisonment and probable death at the barricade, reveals his true identity to Marius and Cosette after their wedding, and is reunited with them just before his death, having kept his promise to the bishop and to Fantine, the image of whom is the last thing he sees before dying.\n• Javert – A fanatic police inspector in pursuit to recapture Valjean. Born in the prisons to a convict father and a fortune teller mother, he renounces both of them and starts working as a guard in the prison, including one stint as the overseer for the chain gang of which Valjean is part (and here witnesses firsthand Valjean's enormous strength and just what he looks like). Eventually, he joins the police force in Montreuil-sur-Mer. He arrests Fantine and comes into conflict with Valjean/Madeleine, who orders him to release Fantine. Valjean dismisses Javert in front of his squad, and Javert, seeking revenge, reports to the police inspector that he has discovered Jean Valjean. He is told that he must be incorrect, as a man mistakenly believed to be Jean Valjean was just arrested. He requests M. Madeleine to dismiss him in disgrace, for he cannot be less harsh on himself than on others. When the real Jean Valjean turns himself in, Javert is promoted to the Paris police force, where he arrests Valjean and sends him back to prison. After Valjean escapes again, Javert attempts one more arrest in vain. He almost recaptures Valjean at the Gorbeau House when he arrests the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette. Later, while working undercover behind the barricade, his identity is discovered. Valjean pretends to execute Javert but releases him. When Javert next encounters Valjean emerging from the sewers, he allows him a brief visit home and then walks off instead of arresting him. Javert cannot reconcile his devotion to the law with his recognition that the lawful course is immoral. After composing a letter to the prefect of police outlining the squalid conditions that occur in prisons and the abuses that prisoners are subjected to, he takes his own life by jumping into the Seine.\n• Fantine – She was born in Montreuil-sur-Mer but moved to Paris as a teenager. This grisette was abandoned with a small child by her lover, Félix Tholomyès. Fantine leaves her daughter, Cosette, in the care of the Thénardiers, innkeepers in the village of Montfermeil. Mme. Thénardier spoils her own daughters and abuses Cosette. Fantine finds work at Monsieur Madeleine's factory. Illiterate, she has others write letters to the Thénardiers on her behalf. A female supervisor discovers that she is an unwed mother and dismisses her. To meet the Thénardiers' repeated demands for money, she sells her hair and two front teeth and turns to prostitution. She becomes ill. Valjean learns of her plight when Javert arrests her for attacking a man who called her insulting names and threw snow down her back. He sends her to a hospital. Because her illness has made her so weak, she dies of shock when Javert, confronting Valjean in her hospital room, reveals that Valjean is a convict and has not brought Cosette to her (after the doctor encouraged the incorrect belief that Jean Valjean's recent absence was because he was bringing her daughter to her).\n• Cosette (formally Euphrasie, also known as \"the Lark\", Mademoiselle Lanoire, Ursula) – The illegitimate daughter of Fantine and Tholomyès. From approximately the age of three to the age of eight, she is beaten and forced to work as a drudge for the Thénardiers. After her mother dies, Valjean ransoms her from the Thénardiers and cares for her as if she were his daughter. Nuns in a Paris convent educate her. She grows up to become very beautiful. She falls in love with Marius Pontmercy and marries him near the novel's conclusion.\n• Marius Pontmercy – A young law student loosely associated with the Friends of the ABC. He shares the political principles of his father and has a tempestuous relationship with his royalist grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand. He falls in love with Cosette and fights on the barricades when he believes Valjean has taken her to London. After he and Cosette marry, he recognizes Thénardier as a swindler and pays him to leave France.\n• Éponine (the Jondrette girl) – The Thénardiers' elder daughter. As a child, she is pampered and spoiled by her parents but ends up a street urchin when she reaches adolescence. She participates in her father's crimes and begging schemes to obtain money. She is blindly in love with Marius. At Marius's request, she finds Valjean and Cosette's house for him and sadly leads him there. She also prevents her father, Patron-Minette, and Brujon from robbing the house during one of Marius's visits there to see Cosette. After disguising herself as a boy, she manipulates Marius into going to the barricades, hoping she and Marius will die there together. Wanting to die before him, however, she reaches out her hand to stop a soldier from shooting at him; she is mortally wounded as the bullet goes through her hand and her back. As she is dying, she confesses all this to Marius and gives him a letter from Cosette. Her final request to Marius is that once she has passed, he will kiss her on the forehead. He fulfills her request not because of romantic feelings on his part, but out of pity for her hard life.\n• Monsieur Thénardier and Madame Thénardier (also known as the Jondrettes, M. Fabantou, M. Thénard. Some translations identify her as the Thenardiess) – Husband and wife, parents of five children: two daughters, Éponine and Azelma, and three sons, Gavroche and two unnamed younger sons. As innkeepers, they abuse Cosette as a child and extort payment from Fantine for her support, until Valjean takes Cosette away. They become bankrupt and relocate under the name Jondrette to a house in Paris called the Gorbeau House, living in the room next to Marius. The husband associates with a criminal group called Patron-Minette and conspires to rob Valjean until he is thwarted by Marius. Javert arrests the couple. The wife dies in prison. Her husband attempts to blackmail Marius with his knowledge of Valjean's past, but Marius pays him to leave the country and he becomes a slave trader in the United States.\n• Gavroche – The unloved middle child and eldest son of the Thénardiers.

The narrator occasionally injects himself into the narrative or reports facts outside the time of the narrative to emphasize that he is recounting historical events, not entirely fiction. He introduces his recounting of Waterloo with several paragraphs describing the narrator's recent approach to the battlefield: \"Last year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person who is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles ...\" The narrator describes how \"[a]n observer, a dreamer, the author of this book\" during the 1832 street fighting was caught in the crossfire: \"All that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour.\" At one point, he apologizes for intruding—\"The author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself\"—to ask the reader's understanding when he describes \"the Paris of his youth ... as though it still existed\". This introduces a meditation on memories of past places that his contemporary readers would recognize as a self-portrait written from exile: \"You have left a part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\" He describes another occasion when a bullet shot \"pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended ... over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still to be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the pillars of the market.\" As evidence of police double agents at the barricades, he writes, \"The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special report on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\"\n\nThe appearance of the novel was a highly anticipated event, as Victor Hugo was considered one of France's foremost poets in the middle of the nineteenth century. The New York Times announced its forthcoming publication as early as April 1860.[31] Hugo forbade his publishers from summarizing his story and refused to authorize the publication of excerpts in advance of publication. He instructed them to build on his earlier success and suggested this approach: \"What Victor H. did for the Gothic world in Notre-Dame of Paris [The Hunchback of Notre-Dame], he accomplishes for the modern world in Les Misérables\". A massive advertising campaign[33] preceded the release of the first two volumes of Les Misérables in Brussels on 30 or 31 March and in Paris on 3 April 1862.[34] The remaining volumes appeared on 15 May 1862.\n\nCritical reactions were wide-ranging and often negative. Some critics found the subject matter immoral, others complained of its excessive sentimentality, and others were disquieted by its apparent sympathy with the revolutionaries. L. Gauthier wrote in Le Monde on 17 August 1862, \"One cannot read without an unconquerable disgust all the details Monsieur Hugo gives regarding the successful planning of riots.\"[35] The Goncourt brothers judged the novel artificial and disappointing.[36] Flaubert found \"neither truth nor greatness\" in it. He complained that the characters were crude stereotypes who all \"speak very well – but all in the same way\". He deemed it an \"infantile\" effort and brought an end to Hugo's career like \"the fall of a god\".[37] In a newspaper review, Charles Baudelaire praised Hugo's success in focusing public attention on social problems, though he believed that such propaganda was the opposite of art. In private, he castigated it as \"repulsive and inept\" (immonde et inepte).[38][39]\n\nThe work was a commercial success and has been a popular book ever since it was published.[40][41] Translated the same year it appeared into several foreign languages, including Italian, Greek, and Portuguese, it proved popular not only in France but across Europe and abroad.\n• Charles E.

The author aspired to \"write a work which departed from the ordinary, which made a noise, and which would remain on earth after his death\".\n\nAs an epistolary novel, the book is composed of letters written by the various characters to each other. In particular, the letters between Valmont and the Marquise make up the majority of the plot, along with those of Cécile de Volanges and Madame de Tourvel.\n\nIt has been adapted multiple times, including the successful 1985 play and subsequent award-winning 1988 film adaptation.\n\nThe Marquise de Merteuil is determined to corrupt the young Cécile de Volanges, whose mother has only recently brought her out of a convent to be married to Merteuil's previous lover, who has discarded her rudely. At the same time the notorious Vicomte de Valmont is determined to seduce the virtuous, married, and therefore inaccessible Madame de Tourvel, who is staying with his aunt while her husband is away on a court case. Cécile falls in love with the Chevalier Danceny (her young music tutor), and Merteuil and Valmont pretend to help the secret lovers in order to gain their trust and manipulate them later to benefit their own schemes.\n\nMerteuil first suggests that the Vicomte should seduce Cécile in order to enact her revenge on Cécile's future husband but Valmont refuses, finding the challenge too easy and preferring to devote himself to seducing Madame de Tourvel. He is however interested in resuming their affair. Merteuil promises Valmont that if he seduces Madame de Tourvel and provides her with written proof of seduction, she will spend the night with him.\n\nValmont befriends Tourvel by convincing her that he has changed his rakish ways and become a virtuous man, but he finds seducing her to be a far greater challenge than his previous conquests.\n\nValmont is infuriated on discovering that Cécile's mother has written to Madame de Tourvel to warn her about his bad character. He avenges himself by seducing Cécile as Merteuil had suggested. Meanwhile, Merteuil takes Danceny as her lover.\n\nBy the time Valmont has succeeded in seducing Madame de Tourvel, he seems to have fallen in love with her. Jealous, Merteuil tricks him into deserting Madame de Tourvel, and reneges on her promise of spending the night with him. In retaliation, Valmont reveals that he prompted Danceny to reunite with Cécile, leaving Merteuil abandoned yet again. Merteuil declares war on Valmont and reveals to Danceny that Valmont has seduced Cécile.\n\nDanceny and Valmont duel, and Valmont is fatally wounded. Before he dies, he gives Danceny the letters proving Merteuil's own involvement. These letters are sufficient to ruin her reputation, and she flees to the countryside, after contracting smallpox. Her face is left permanently scarred and she is rendered blind in one eye. She loses her greatest asset, her beauty, as well as her reputation and much of her fortune. Desperate with guilt and grief, Madame de Tourvel succumbs to a fever and dies, while Cécile returns to the convent, dishonoured.\n\nLes Liaisons dangereuses is celebrated for its exploration of seduction, revenge and malice, presented in the form of fictional letters collected and published by a fictional author. The book was viewed as scandalous at the time of its publication, though the real intentions of the author remain unknown. It has been suggested that Laclos's intention was the same as that of his fictional author in the novel; to write a morality tale about the French nobility of the Ancien Régime. The theory has been questioned on several grounds; Laclos enjoyed the patronage of France's most senior aristocrat—Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. All the characters in the story are aristocrats, including the virtuous ones like Madame de Tourvel and Madame de Rosemonde and many royalist and conservative figures enjoyed the book, including Queen Marie Antoinette, which suggests that—despite its scandalous reputation—it was not viewed as a political work until the French Revolution made it appear as such, with the benefit of hindsight.\n\nWayland Young notes that most critics have viewed the work as\n\nIn a well-known essay on Les Liaisons dangereuses, which has often been used as a preface to French editions of the novel, André Malraux argues that, despite its debt to the libertine tradition, Les Liaisons dangereuses is more significant as the introduction of a new kind of character in French fiction. Malraux writes that the Marquise de Merteuil and the Vicomte de Valmont are creations \"without precedent\"; they are \"the first [in European literature] whose acts are determined by an ideology\".[2]\n\nLes Liaisons dangereuses is a literary counter-thesis to the epistolary novel as exemplified by Richardson's Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded. Whereas Richardson uses the technique of letters to provide the reader with a feeling of knowing the protagonist's true and intimate thoughts, Laclos' use of this literary device is the opposite: by presenting the reader with grossly conflicting views from the same writer when addressing different recipients, it is left to the reader to reconcile story, intentions and characters behind the letters. The use of duplicitous characters with one virtuous face can be viewed as a complex criticism of the immensely popular naïve moral epistolary novel.\n\nThe novel has been adapted into various media, under many different names.\n• German playwright Heiner Müller adapted the story in 1981, entitling it Quartet.\n• Christopher Hampton's 1985 adaptation, Les liaisons dangereuses, opened in London's West End and in 1987 crossed over to Broadway with Alan Rickman originating the role of the Vicomte de Valmont, Lindsay Duncan as Marquise de Merteuil, and Juliet Stevenson as Madame de Tourvel. In 2012 the Sydney Theatre Company staged Hampton's adaptation with Hugo Weaving as the Vicomte, and Pamela Rabe as the Marquise.\n• In 2012, John Malkovich directed a version of the play with Paris' Théâtre de l'Atelier.\n• Las Relaciones Peligrosas, a musical adaptation penned by Marcelo Caballero (book and lyrics) and Steban Ghorghor (music), had a world premiere in 2012 at El Cubo Theatre, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n• In 2015, Josie Rourke directed a revival of the Christopher Hampton version at the Donmar Warehouse in London with Dominic West as the Vicomte and Janet McTeer as the Marquise.

Wikipedia: The Leftovers is an American supernatural drama television series created by Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta that aired on HBO from June 29, 2014, to June 4, 2017.[1] Based on Perrotta's 2011 novel,[2] the series begins three years after the \"Sudden Departure\", a global event that resulted in 2% of the world's population disappearing. The lives of police chief Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) and his family, along with grieving widow Nora Durst (Carrie Coon) and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison (Christopher Eccleston), are the focal points of the series as they struggle to adjust to life after the Departure.\n\nThe pilot was written by Lindelof and Perrotta and directed by Peter Berg.[3] The series stars an ensemble cast led by Theroux and features Amy Brenneman, Christopher Eccleston, Liv Tyler, Chris Zylka, Margaret Qualley, Carrie Coon, Ann Dowd, Regina King, Jovan Adepo, Kevin Carroll, Janel Moloney, and Scott Glenn. The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on October 4, 2015, and concluded December 6, 2015.[4] On December 10, 2015, at Lindelof's request to be able to conclude the series, HBO renewed it for a third and final season,[6] which premiered on April 16, 2017, and concluded on June 4, 2017.[7] Over the course of the series, 28 episodes aired over three seasons.\n\nThe first season received mostly positive reviews, though some criticized the series for its grim tone.[8] The series underwent a critical reevaluation during its acclaimed second and third seasons,[9][10] with many critics referring to The Leftovers as one of the greatest television series of all time,[11][12][13][14][15] with particular praise for its writing, directing, acting (particularly Theroux's and Coon's) and thematic depth.[8][9][10] The musical score composed by Max Richter also attracted critical praise.[16] Despite receiving average Nielsen ratings throughout its run, the series has developed a cult following.[17][18] The series has been compared favorably to Lost, a previous series co-created by Lindelof.[19][20][21][22]\n\nThe Leftovers starts three years after a global event called the \"Sudden Departure\", the inexplicable, simultaneous disappearance of 140 million people, 2% of the world's population, on October 14, 2011.[23] Following that event, mainstream religions declined, and a number of cults emerged, most notably the Guilty Remnant, a group of white-clothed, chain-smoking nihilists, and a cult led by Holy Wayne, a man who views himself as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[24]\n\nThe first season revolves around the Garvey family and their acquaintances in a fictionalized version of the town of Mapleton, New York. Kevin Garvey Jr. is the chief of police. His wife, Laurie, has joined the Guilty Remnant. Their son, Tommy, has left home to become a follower of Holy Wayne, and their daughter, Jill, is acting out.[2] Meanwhile, grieving widow Nora Durst and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison, struggle to deal with their respective traumas while adjusting to life post-Departure. It also follows Meg Abbott, a woman who is slowly seduced by the Mapleton faction of the Guilty Remnant, led by Patti Levin. These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.\n\nIn the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the fictional town of Jarden, Texas, where not a single citizen was lost in the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town, also acting as a vigilante deterrent of people exploiting Jarden's \"miracle\". His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is an aspiring pastor and their daughter, Evie, is a high school student with epilepsy. The Garvey family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.\n\nThe third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting 14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure.

He served as the series' showrunner.[2]\n\nIn February 2013, HBO ordered a pilot and, in September, ordered a 10-episode first season.[29][30] The Leftovers is the first series HBO acquired from an outside studio that it did not produce in-house.[31]\n\nThe first season covers the entirety of the book; the second and third seasons are completely original material.[32][33] In April 2015, it was reported that the setting for the second season would shift from Mapleton, New York to a small town in Texas.[34] The series shifted filming locations from New York to Austin, Texas, with nearby Lockhart serving as the main street of fictional Jarden, Texas, when principal photography commenced in late April.[35][36] For the second season, which features several changes, including cast, location, and storylines; Lindelof cited The Wire and Friday Night Lights as influences.[37][38]\n\nThe final season began principal photography in early May 2016, in Austin.[33] In June 2016, the production moved to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, where it filmed the remainder of the series and completed post-production. On the move to Melbourne, Lindelof said, \"We're immensely grateful for the opportunity to try something that looks and feels different from the preceding seasons and we absolutely cannot wait to bring our story to its conclusion down under.\"[39][40] It was also confirmed that the season would have a shortened 8-episode run.[41]\n\nIn June 2013, casting announcements began. Justin Theroux, Liv Tyler, Christopher Eccleston, Ann Dowd, Amanda Warren, Michael Gaston, and Carrie Coon were announced to star in the pilot.[42][43][44]\n\nFor the second season, eight of the 14 main cast members from season one returned, while Emily Meade, Amanda Warren, Annie Q., Max Carver, Charlie Carver and Michael Gaston did not.[45] In April 2015, casting began for a family comprising ex-convict John Murphy; his hearing-impaired doctor wife, Erika; and their teenage children Evie, an outgoing athlete, and Michael, a pious Christian.[34] The roles of John, Erika, and Michael are portrayed by Kevin Carroll, Regina King and Jovan Adepo, respectively, all as series regulars.[46][47] Darius McCrary was cast in a recurring role as Isaac Rayney, John's friend and a palm reader.[47] Steven Williams was cast in a recurring role, playing Virgil, a confidant of Kevin's.[48] Janel Moloney, who had a recurring role in the first season as Mary Jamison, was promoted to a regular cast member in season two.\n\nFor the third season, it was confirmed in May 2016 that the entire main cast from the second season would return, with the exception of Dowd, and that Scott Glenn and Jasmin Savoy Brown had been promoted to series regulars.[41] Glenn is credited as part of the main cast for the five season 3 episodes in which he appears; Brown ultimately remained as a recurring guest star, appearing in three episodes of the season. Lindsay Duncan joined the cast on December 6, 2016, also as a recurring guest star.[49] Duncan appears in five episodes of the season.\n\nSeveral cast members did not continue in a regular capacity during season 3, but retain main cast credit for the episodes in which they feature. Liv Tyler appears in one scene in the first episode, and returns for one subsequent appearance in episode 7. Ann Dowd also returns to the main cast in episode 7 only. Margaret Qualley appears in the season's first episode only, with one subsequent voice cameo. Regina King appears in episode 2 only, and Janel Moloney features in two episodes. Chris Zylka appears for the final time in episode 2, making only one subsequent voice cameo, but retains his credit as a main cast member for the entire season. Additionally, season 1 main cast members Michael Gaston and Annie Q. return as guest stars.\n\nThe main title from the first season uses \"The Leftovers (Main Title Theme)\", an original piece of music by composer Max Richter, accompanied by images like a fresco in the style of the Sistine Chapel. The second season uses \"Let the Mystery Be\" by Iris DeMent. In addition, the opening changes to one that shows images of pictures and people who were departed missing from them and in their place is various images of earth-related phenomena like rain, clouds, aurora borealis and lightning. Season 3 retains the opening from Season 2 but with a different theme song for each episode, including reprises of the Season 1 main title theme and \"Let the Mystery Be\" in episodes seven and eight respectively. This is because Damon Lindelof wants to \"thematically introduce the episode to come\" with different title music for each episode.\n• \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now\" (theme from Perfect Strangers) by David Pomeranz\n• \"This Love Is Over\" by Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs\n• \"Let the Mystery Be\" by Iris DeMent\n\nThe first season of The Leftovers received mostly positive reviews from critics. Metacritic scored season one 65 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[50] Rotten Tomatoes scored the season 82%, based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 7.65/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Its dour tone and self-seriousness may make for somber viewing, but The Leftovers is an artfully crafted, thought-provoking drama that aims high and often hits its mark.\"[8] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave consistently high scores to all the season one episodes, including two perfect 10 scores for \"Two Boats and a Helicopter\" and the season finale \"The Prodigal Son Returns.\"[51] He then gave the entire first season a review score of 9.4 out of 10, particularly praising the character-centric episodes, Max Richter's score and the performances, particularly Carrie Coon's.[52]\n\nThe second season received critical acclaim. On Metacritic, it has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 94% with an average score of 8.8/10 based on 164 critic reviews, with the critical consensus \"The Leftovers continues to be unpredictable and provocative in season two with its new location, though the inexplicable circumstances will still frustrate many viewers.\"[9] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave it an \"A\" grade and wrote that \"The Leftovers is still TV's best drama as season 2 begins\"; it has \"tighter focus, but same powerful, immersive experience\".[54] In her five out of five star review, Emily St. James of Vox wrote: \"It's a show that wants to provoke a reaction in you, whether it's admiration, hatred, or just bafflement. It's HBO's best drama—and thus must-see TV.\"[55]\n\nThe third and final season received unanimous acclaim from critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 98 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56] On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 99% rating with an average score of 9.35/10 based on 189 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With reliably ambitious storytelling and outstanding performances from its cast, Season 3 of The Leftovers approaches the series' conclusion as thoughtfully, purposefully, and confidently as it began.\"[10] Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote the final season \"is spectacular, in every sense of that word.\"[57] The Leftovers was ranked as the best TV series of 2017 according to Metacritic.[58] Alan Sepinwall placed season three first on his list of the best TV shows of 2017, an accolade he had awarded to both previous seasons in their respective years. He said \"this has been my show of the year — of the decade, maybe, depending on how we count things like Mad Men and Breaking Bad that debuted in the '00s\"; he went on to say \"the eight-episode final season was a miracle\".[59]\n\nAccording to Metacritic's aggregate of critics' decade-end lists, The Leftovers was the fifth-highest ranked show of the 2010s.[60]\n\nThe first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in region 1 on October 6, 2015. The set contains two audio commentaries and four behind-the-scenes featurettes.[84] The second season was released on Blu-ray and DVD on February 9, 2016.[85] The third season's DVD format was released on October 10, 2017, while the Blu-ray format was released by the Warner Archive Collection.[86]The Leftovers (TV Series 2014–2017) ⭐ 8.3 | Drama, Fantasy, Mystery: Love everything about The Leftovers the writing, soundtrack, acting, and the goosebumps vibe I get from it is sensational!

Accédez à notre formulaire de contact et nous vous répondrons dans les plus brefs délais.Alexandrine Le Normant d'Étiolles - Wikipedia: Alexandrine-Jeanne Le Normant d’Étiolles (10 August 1744 – 15 June 1754) was the daughter of Madame de Pompadour, the maîtresse-en-titre of King Louis XV of France. She died in childhood.\n\nAlexandrine-Jeanne Le Normant d’Étiolles was born on 10 August 1744 to Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d’Étiolles and his wife Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson. She was named after her mother’s friend, author and salon host Claudine-Alexandrine Guérin de Tencin. It is possible that her parents were first cousins, as her mother’s biological father may have been Charles-François Paul Le Normant de Tournehem (who became Madame d’Étiolles’ guardian when her legal father, her mother’s husband, went into exile). Alexandrine had one sibling, an older brother named Charles-Guillaume-Louis (born December 1741, died before December 1742) who had already died by the time she was born.\n\nAlexandrine’s mother aimed to become the maîtresse-en-titre of King Louis XV. She achieved this by March 1745. However, to be introduced at court, she needed a noble title. The King and Madame d’Étiolles decided that she should separate from her husband, and the proceedings were initiated by 9 May. Madame d’Étiolles requested custody of her nine-month-old daughter. She was then made marquise of Pompadour and began to be known as Madame de Pompadour. Monsieur d’Étiolles was devastated and angered, threatening suicide, but soon accepted the situation. He started a new family with his mistress in 1754.[4]\n\nAlexandrine had been sent to a village wet nurse where her mother visited her often and brought her to Versailles more and more as she matured. After being weaned, she continued to be raised by a nurse and other domestic staff, but regularly spent time in her mother’s apartments or visited her maternal grandfather, François Poisson, who loved her affectionately. She grew up in a warm environment provided by her mother, maternal grandfather, and maternal uncle, Abel-François Poisson de Vandières, Marquis of Marigny and Menars.\n\nShe was known as ‘Madame Alexandrine’, following the form of addressing the filles de France, but her family nicknamed her ‘Fanfan’. She was described as ‘very thin’ but healthy.[8] Her education was supervised by the novelist Claud Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon, her mother’s friend and former teacher. At the age of six, Alexandrine was placed at the Convent of the Assumption in the rue Saint-Honoré in Paris, where many daughters of the aristocracy were raised, in order to prepare her for a career at court. Before entering, she spent a week with her mother in Marly-le-Roi. Madame de Pompadour was worried to leave her child in Paris but considered convent schooling important for her later success. She continued to spend time with her as often as possible.\n\nHer mother started arranging for Alexandrine a marriage that could integrate their family into the aristocracy. Pompadour’s first proposal was an illegitimate son of the King, Charles de Vintimille, Count of Luc. He was three years older than Alexandrine and the two occasionally played together. However, Louis XV did not agree to the plan. Pompadour then negotiated with Antoine de Vignerot du Plessis, Duke of Richelieu about a union between Alexandrine and the Duke’s son and heir, Armand-Emmanuel, Count of Chinon. Richelieu refused the idea, saying that as his wife was related to the House of Lorraine, the match would need to be approved by the Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I of Lorraine. He argued that the imperial court (headed by Empress Maria Theresa) would never agree to one of the Emperor’s relatives marrying a girl of middle-class origins, although this was probably an excuse for her own unwillingness. Although Pompadour could hope for an advantageous marriage for her daughter, the highest-ranking families did not want to be related to her. In the summer of 1752, she agreed with her close friend, Michel-Ferdinand d’Albert d’Ailly, Duke of Chaulnes, that Alexandrine would marry his only child, Louis-Joseph d’Albert d’Ailly, Duke of Picquigny.[14] They decided that the wedding would take place when Alexandrine was thirteen. It was also rumoured that her uncle Marigny wanted to marry Alexandrine himself.\n\nOn 14 June 1754, Alexandrine (still living at the convent) became ill with a high fever and convulsions. It was initially thought that she had indigestion. The nuns informed her parents; most biographies state that her father rushed to her, although Margaret Crosland clams there is no proof of this. Pevitt says that Pompadour was at the Château de Choisy with the King and could not leave to see her daughter,[4] while Crosland claims that she was not at court and could not be reached in time. Whatever the reason, she could not be with Alexandrine on her last day. Louis XV sent his own physicians, Jean-Baptiste Sénac and Germain Pichault de La Martinière [fr] but Alexandrine had died by the time they arrived. She died on 15 June 1754, less than two months before her tenth birthday, probably of peritonitis or appendicitis.\n\nPompadour was so stricken by grief when she was informed of her child’s death that onlookers feared she would collapse and die herself. She left court to spend a week in her Château de Bellevue, being ‘very afflicted and unwell’. Six weeks later, a contemporary reported that she acted happy, not displaying her grief over her daughter’s death, as that would have ‘done harm to her looks’ and endangered her position as maîtresse-en-titre. Privately, she remained ‘deeply shaken’. The contemporary noted that this behaviour was regular for courtiers.[4] Her grandfather, François Poisson, who had already been ill, died four or ten days after Alexandrine, devastated by her death. Pompadour never recovered from Alexandrine’s death,[4] which made her feel hopeless about the future.\n\nAlexandrine was buried in the Convent of the Assumption. Four months after her death, her body was transferred to the Capuchin Covent in Paris, where her mother had purchased a vault for the family. Her grave was inscribed, ‘Here lies Alexandrine-Jeanne, daughter of Messire Charles-Guillaume Le Normant and Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, Marquise de Pompadour, Dame de Crécy, etc’. Pompadour often visited the grave to pray. The remains of her maternal grandmother, Madeleine de La Motte, were also taken there, and Pompadour herself would later be interred there. The vault was damaged during the Revolution and the surrounding buildings rebuilt, inhibiting access to the tomb which, as of 2024, is under the rue de la Paix in Paris.2007 - Wikipedia: It has since been lost at the Battle of the Kodori ValleyNCBI - WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic: Your access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that enable them to thrive and adapt in varied environments, develop highly complex tools, and form complex social structures and civilizations. Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of distinct social groups – from families and peer groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society. Humans are also highly curious: the desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine. As of April 2024, there are estimated to be more than 8 billion humans alive.\n\nFor most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change. Since then, a number of civilizations have risen and fallen, while a number of sociocultural and technological developments have resulted in significant changes to the human lifestyle.\n\nAlthough some scientists equate the term \"humans\" with all members of the genus Homo, in common usage it generally refers to Homo sapiens, the only extant member. All other members of the genus Homo, which are now extinct, are known as archaic humans, and the term \"modern human\" is used to distinguish Homo sapiens from archaic humans. Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species. Migrating out of Africa, they gradually replaced and interbred with local populations of archaic humans. Multiple hypotheses for the extinction of archaic human species such as Neanderthals include competition, violence, interbreeding with Homo sapiens, or inability to adapt to climate change. Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), humans are among the least genetically diverse primates. Any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.\n\nHumans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans have had a dramatic effect on the environment. They are apex predators, being rarely preyed upon by other species.[1] Human population growth, industrialization, land development, overconsumption and combustion of fossil fuels have led to environmental destruction and pollution that significantly contributes to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life.[2][3] Within the last century, humans have explored challenging environments such as Antarctica, the deep sea, and outer space.[4] Human habitation within these hostile environments is restrictive and expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.[4] Humans have visited the Moon and made their presence known on other celestial bodies through human-made robotic spacecraft.[5][6][7] Since the early 20th century, there has been continuous human presence in Antarctica through research stations and, since 2000, in space through habitation on the International Space Station.[8] Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.\n\nAll modern humans are classified into the species Homo sapiens, coined by Carl Linnaeus in his 1735 work Systema Naturae.[9] The generic name Homo is a learned 18th-century derivation from Latin homō, which refers to humans of either sex.[10][11] The word human can refer to all members of the Homo genus.[12] The name Homo sapiens means 'wise man' or 'knowledgeable man'.[13] There is disagreement if certain extinct members of the genus, namely Neanderthals, should be included as a separate species of humans or as a subspecies of H. sapiens.[12]\n\nHuman is a loanword of Middle English from Old French humain, ultimately from Latin hūmānus, the adjectival form of homō ('man' – in the sense of humanity).[14] The native English term man can refer to the species generally (a synonym for humanity) as well as to human males. It may also refer to individuals of either sex.[15]\n\nDespite the fact that the word animal is colloquially used as an antonym for human,[16] and contrary to a common biological misconception, humans are animals.[17] The word person is often used interchangeably with human, but philosophical debate exists as to whether personhood applies to all humans or all sentient beings, and further if a human can lose personhood (such as by going into a persistent vegetative state).[18]\n\nHumans are apes (superfamily Hominoidea).[19] The lineage of apes that eventually gave rise to humans first split from gibbons (family Hylobatidae) and orangutans (genus Pongo), then gorillas (genus Gorilla), and finally, chimpanzees and bonobos (genus Pan). The last split, between the human and chimpanzee–bonobo lineages, took place around 8–4 million years ago, in the late Miocene epoch.[20][21] During this split, chromosome 2 was formed from the joining of two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.[22] Following their split with chimpanzees and bonobos, the hominins diversified into many species and at least two distinct genera. All but one of these lineages – representing the genus Homo and its sole extant species Homo sapiens – are now extinct.[23]\n\nThe genus Homo evolved from Australopithecus.[24][25] Though fossils from the transition are scarce, the earliest members of Homo share several key traits with Australopithecus.[26][27] The earliest record of Homo is the 2.8 million-year-old specimen LD 350-1 from Ethiopia, and the earliest named species are Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis which evolved by 2.3 million years ago.[27] H. erectus (the African variant is sometimes called H. ergaster) evolved 2 million years ago and was the first archaic human species to leave Africa and disperse across Eurasia.[28] H. erectus also was the first to evolve a characteristically human body plan. Homo sapiens emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago from a species commonly designated as either H. heidelbergensis or H. rhodesiensis, the descendants of H. erectus that remained in Africa.[29] H. sapiens migrated out of the continent, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans.[30][31][32] Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000–70,000 years ago,[33] and possibly earlier.[34] This development was likely selected amidst natural climate change in Middle to Late Pleistocene Africa.[35]\n\nThe \"out of Africa\" migration took place in at least two waves, the first around 130,000 to 100,000 years ago, the second (Southern Dispersal) around 70,000 to 50,000 years ago.[36][37] H. sapiens proceeded to colonize all the continents and larger islands, arriving in Eurasia 125,000 years ago,[38][39] Australia around 65,000 years ago,[40] the Americas around 15,000 years ago, and remote islands such as Hawaii, Easter Island, Madagascar, and New Zealand in the years 300 to 1280 CE.[41][42]\n\nHuman evolution was not a simple linear or branched progression but involved interbreeding between related species.[43][44][45] Genomic research has shown that hybridization between substantially diverged lineages was common in human evolution.[46] DNA evidence suggests that several genes of Neanderthal origin are present among all non sub-Saharan-African populations, and Neanderthals and other hominins, such as Denisovans, may have contributed up to 6% of their genome to present-day non sub-Saharan-African humans.[43][47][48]\n\nHuman evolution is characterized by a number of morphological, developmental, physiological, and behavioral changes that have taken place since the split between the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees. The most significant of these adaptations are hairlessness,[49] obligate bipedalism, increased brain size and decreased sexual dimorphism (neoteny). The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.[50]\n\nUntil about 12,000 years ago, all humans lived as hunter-gatherers.[51][52] The Neolithic Revolution (the invention of agriculture) first took place in Southwest Asia and spread through large parts of the Old World over the following millennia.[53] It also occurred independently in Mesoamerica (about 6,000 years ago),[54] China,[55][56] Papua New Guinea,[57] and the Sahel and West Savanna regions of Africa.[58][59][60]\n\nAccess to food surplus led to the formation of permanent human settlements, the domestication of animals and the use of metal tools for the first time in history. Agriculture and sedentary lifestyle led to the emergence of early civilizations.[61][62][63]\n\nAn urban revolution took place in the 4th millennium BCE with the development of city-states, particularly Sumerian cities located in Mesopotamia.[64] It was in these cities that the earliest known form of writing, cuneiform script, appeared around 3000 BCE.[65] Other major civilizations to develop around this time were Ancient Egypt and the Indus Valley Civilisation.[66] They eventually traded with each other and invented technology such as wheels, plows and sails.[67][68][69][70] Emerging by 3000 BCE, the Caral–Supe civilization is the oldest complex civilization in the Americas.[71] Astronomy and mathematics were also developed and the Great Pyramid of Giza was built.[72][73][74] There is evidence of a severe drought lasting about a hundred years that may have caused the decline of these civilizations,[75] with new ones appearing in the aftermath. Babylonians came to dominate Mesopotamia while others,[76] such as the Poverty Point culture, Minoans and the Shang dynasty, rose to prominence in new areas.[77][78][79] The Late Bronze Age collapse around 1200 BCE resulted in the disappearance of a number of civilizations and the beginning of the Greek Dark Ages.[80][81] During this period iron started replacing bronze, leading to the Iron Age.[82]\n\nIn the 5th century BCE, history started being recorded as a discipline, which provided a much clearer picture of life at the time.[83] Between the 8th and 6th century BCE, Europe entered the classical antiquity age, a period when ancient Greece and ancient Rome flourished.[84][85] Around this time other civilizations also came to prominence. The Maya civilization started to build cities and create complex calendars.[86][87] In Africa, the Kingdom of Aksum overtook the declining Kingdom of Kush and facilitated trade between India and the Mediterranean.[88] In West Asia, the Achaemenid Empire's system of centralized governance became the precursor to many later empires,[89] while the Gupta Empire in India and the Han dynasty in China have been described as golden ages in their respective regions.[90][91]\n\nFollowing the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Europe entered the Middle Ages.[92] During this period, Christianity and the Church would provide centralized authority and education.[93] In the Middle East, Islam became the prominent religion and expanded into North Africa. It led to an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life.[94][95] The Christian and Islamic worlds would eventually clash, with the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire declaring a series of holy wars to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims.[96]\n\nIn the Americas, between 200 and 900 CE Mesoamerica was in its Classic Period,[97] while further north, complex Mississippian societies would arise starting around 800 CE.[98] The Mongol Empire would conquer much of Eurasia in the 13th and 14th centuries.[99] Over this same time period, the Mali Empire in Africa grew to be the largest empire on the continent, stretching from Senegambia to Ivory Coast.[100] Oceania would see the rise of the Tuʻi Tonga Empire which expanded across many islands in the South Pacific.[101] By the late 15th century, the Aztecs and Inca had become the dominant power in Mesoamerica and the Andes, respectively.[102]\n\nThe early modern period in Europe and the Near East ( 1450–1800) began with the final defeat of the Byzantine Empire, and the rise of the Ottoman Empire.[103] Meanwhile, Japan entered the Edo period,[104] the Qing dynasty rose in China[105] and the Mughal Empire ruled much of India.[106] Europe underwent the Renaissance, starting in the 15th century,[107] and the Age of Discovery began with the exploring and colonizing of new regions.[108] This included the colonization of the Americas[109] and the Columbian Exchange.[110] This expansion led to the Atlantic slave trade[111] and the genocide of Native American peoples.[112] This period also marked the Scientific Revolution, with great advances in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy and physiology.[113]\n\nThe late modern period (1800–present) saw the Technological and Industrial Revolution bring such discoveries as imaging technology, major innovations in transport and energy development.[114] Influenced by Enlightenment ideals, the Americas and Europe experienced a period of political revolutions known as the Age of Revolution.[115] The Napoleonic Wars raged through Europe in the early 1800s,[116] Spain lost most of its colonies in the New World,[117] while Europeans continued expansion into Africa – where European control went from 10% to almost 90% in less than 50 years[118] – and Oceania.[119] In the 19th century, the British Empire expanded to become the world's largest empire.[120]\n\nA tenuous balance of power among European nations collapsed in 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War, one of the deadliest conflicts in history.[121] In the 1930s, a worldwide economic crisis led to the rise of authoritarian regimes and a Second World War, involving almost all of the world's countries.[122] The war's destruction led to the collapse of most global empires, leading to widespread decolonization.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Second World War in 1945, the United States[123] and the USSR emerged as the remaining global superpowers. This led to a Cold War that saw a struggle for global influence, including a nuclear arms race and a space race, ending in the collapse of the Soviet Union.[124][125] The current Information Age, spurred by the development of the Internet and artificial intelligence systems, sees the world becoming increasingly globalized and interconnected.[126]\n\nEarly human settlements were dependent on proximity to water and – depending on the lifestyle – other natural resources used for subsistence, such as populations of animal prey for hunting and arable land for growing crops and grazing livestock.[130] Modern humans, however, have a great capacity for altering their habitats by means of technology, irrigation, urban planning, construction, deforestation and desertification.[131] Human settlements continue to be vulnerable to natural disasters, especially those placed in hazardous locations and with low quality of construction.[132] Grouping and deliberate habitat alteration is often done with the goals of providing protection, accumulating comforts or material wealth, expanding the available food, improving aesthetics, increasing knowledge or enhancing the exchange of resources.[133]\n\nHumans are one of the most adaptable species, despite having a low or narrow tolerance for many of the earth's extreme environments.[134] Currently the species is present in all eight biogeographical realms, although their presence in the Antarctic realm is very limited to research stations and annually there is a population decline in the winter months of this realm. Humans established nation-states in the other seven realms, such as South Africa, India, Russia, Australia, Fiji, United States and Brazil (each located in a different biogeographical realm).\n\nBy using advanced tools and clothing, humans have been able to extend their tolerance to a wide variety of temperatures, humidities, and altitudes.[134][135] As a result, humans are a cosmopolitan species found in almost all regions of the world, including tropical rainforest, arid desert, extremely cold arctic regions, and heavily polluted cities; in comparison, most other species are confined to a few geographical areas by their limited adaptability.[136] The human population is not, however, uniformly distributed on the Earth's surface, because the population density varies from one region to another, and large stretches of surface are almost completely uninhabited, like Antarctica and vast swathes of the ocean.[134][137] Most humans (61%) live in Asia; the remainder live in the Americas (14%), Africa (14%), Europe (11%), and Oceania (0.5%).[138]\n\nEstimates of the population at the time agriculture emerged in around 10,000 BC have ranged between 1 million and 15 million.[140][141] Around 50–60 million people lived in the combined eastern and western Roman Empire in the 4th century AD.[142] Bubonic plagues, first recorded in the 6th century AD, reduced the population by 50%, with the Black Death killing 75–200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa alone.[143] Human population is believed to have reached one billion in 1800. It has since then increased exponentially, reaching two billion in 1930 and three billion in 1960, four in 1975, five in 1987 and six billion in 1999.[144] It passed seven billion in 2011[145] and passed eight billion in November 2022.[146] It took over two million years of human prehistory and history for the human population to reach one billion and only 207 years more to grow to 7 billion.[147] The combined biomass of the carbon of all the humans on Earth in 2018 was estimated at 60 million tons, about 10 times larger than that of all non-domesticated mammals.[139]\n\nIn 2018, 4.2 billion humans (55%) lived in urban areas, up from 751 million in 1950.[148] The most urbanized regions are Northern America (82%), Latin America (81%), Europe (74%) and Oceania (68%), with Africa and Asia having nearly 90% of the world's 3.4 billion rural population.[148] Problems for humans living in cities include various forms of pollution and crime,[149] especially in inner city and suburban slums.\n\nMost aspects of human physiology are closely homologous to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The dental formula of humans is: 2.1.2.32.1.2.3. Humans have proportionately shorter palates and much smaller teeth than other primates. They are the only primates to have short, relatively flush canine teeth. Humans have characteristically crowded teeth, with gaps from lost teeth usually closing up quickly in young individuals. Humans are gradually losing their third molars, with some individuals having them congenitally absent.[150]\n\nHumans share with chimpanzees a vestigial tail,[151] appendix, flexible shoulder joints, grasping fingers and opposable thumbs.[152] Humans also have a more barrel-shaped chests in contrast to the funnel shape of other apes, an adaptation for bipedal respiration.[153] Apart from bipedalism and brain size, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in smelling, hearing and digesting proteins.[154] While humans have a density of hair follicles comparable to other apes, it is predominantly vellus hair, most of which is so short and wispy as to be practically invisible.[155][156] Humans have about 2 million sweat glands spread over their entire bodies, many more than chimpanzees, whose sweat glands are scarce and are mainly located on the palm of the hand and on the soles of the feet.[157]\n\nIt is estimated that the worldwide average height for an adult human male is about 171 cm (5 ft 7 in), while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about 159 cm (5 ft 3 in).[158] Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be typical in the extremely aged.[159] Throughout history, human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.[160] The average mass of an adult human is 59 kg (130 lb) for females and 77 kg (170 lb) for males.[161][162] Like many other conditions, body weight and body type are influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.[163][164]\n\nHumans have a far faster and more accurate throw than other animals.[165] Humans are also among the best long-distance runners in the animal kingdom, but slower over short distances.[166][154] Humans' thinner body hair and more productive sweat glands help avoid heat exhaustion while running for long distances.[167] Compared to other apes, the human heart produces greater stroke volume and cardiac output and the aorta is proportionately larger.[168][169]\n\nLike most animals, humans are a diploid and eukaryotic species. Each somatic cell has two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set received from one parent; gametes have only one set of chromosomes, which is a mixture of the two parental sets. Among the 23 pairs of chromosomes, there are 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Like other mammals, humans have an XY sex-determination system, so that females have the sex chromosomes XX and males have XY.[170] Genes and environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility and mental abilities. The exact influence of genes and environment on certain traits is not well understood.[171][172]\n\nWhile no humans – not even monozygotic twins – are genetically identical,[173] two humans on average will have a genetic similarity of 99.5%-99.9%.[174][175] This makes them more homogeneous than other great apes, including chimpanzees.[176][177] This small variation in human DNA compared to many other species suggests a population bottleneck during the Late Pleistocene (around 100,000 years ago), in which the human population was reduced to a small number of breeding pairs.[178][179] The forces of natural selection have continued to operate on human populations, with evidence that certain regions of the genome display directional selection in the past 15,000 years.[180]\n\nThe human genome was first sequenced in 2001[181] and by 2020 hundreds of thousands of genomes had been sequenced.[182] In 2012 the International HapMap Project had compared the genomes of 1,184 individuals from 11 populations and identified 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms.[183] African populations harbor the highest number of private genetic variants. While many of the common variants found in populations outside of Africa are also found on the African continent, there are still large numbers that are private to these regions, especially Oceania and the Americas.[184] By 2010 estimates, humans have approximately 22,000 genes.[185] By comparing mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called mitochondrial Eve, must have lived around 90,000 to 200,000 years ago.[186][187][188][189]\n\nMost human reproduction takes place by internal fertilization via sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures.[190] The average gestation period is 38 weeks, but a normal pregnancy can vary by up to 37 days.[191] Embryonic development in the human covers the first eight weeks of development; at the beginning of the ninth week the embryo is termed a fetus.[192] Humans are able to induce early labor or perform a caesarean section if the child needs to be born earlier for medical reasons.[193] In developed countries, infants are typically 3–4 kg (7–9 lb) in weight and 47–53 cm (19–21 in) in height at birth.[194][195] However, low birth weight is common in developing countries, and contributes to the high levels of infant mortality in these regions.[196]\n\nCompared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous, with a much higher risk of complications and death.[197] The size of the fetus's head is more closely matched to the pelvis than in other primates.[198] The reason for this is not completely understood,[n 3] but it contributes to a painful labor that can last 24 hours or more.[200] The chances of a successful labor increased significantly during the 20th century in wealthier countries with the advent of new medical technologies. In contrast, pregnancy and natural childbirth remain hazardous ordeals in developing regions of the world, with maternal death rates approximately 100 times greater than in developed countries.[201]\n\nBoth the mother and the father provide care for human offspring, in contrast to other primates, where parental care is mostly done by the mother.[202] Helpless at birth, humans continue to grow for some years, typically reaching sexual maturity at 15 to 17 years of age.[203][204][205] The human life span has been split into various stages ranging from three to twelve. Common stages include infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood and old age.[206] The lengths of these stages have varied across cultures and time periods but is typified by an unusually rapid growth spurt during adolescence.[207] Human females undergo menopause and become infertile at around the age of 50.[208] It has been proposed that menopause increases a woman's overall reproductive success by allowing her to invest more time and resources in her existing offspring, and in turn their children (the grandmother hypothesis), rather than by continuing to bear children into old age.[209][210]\n\nThe life span of an individual depends on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.[211] For various reasons, including biological/genetic causes, women live on average about four years longer than men.[212] As of 2018 , the global average life expectancy at birth of a girl is estimated to be 74.9 years compared to 70.4 for a boy.[213][214] There are significant geographical variations in human life expectancy, mostly correlated with economic development – for example, life expectancy at birth in Hong Kong is 87.6 years for girls and 81.8 for boys, while in the Central African Republic, it is 55.0 years for girls and 50.6 for boys.[215][216] The developed world is generally aging, with the median age around 40 years. In the developing world, the median age is between 15 and 20 years. While one in five Europeans is 60 years of age or older, only one in twenty Africans is 60 years of age or older.[217] In 2012, the United Nations estimated that there were 316,600 living centenarians (humans of age 100 or older) worldwide.[218]\n\nHumans are omnivorous,[219] capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material.[220][221] Human groups have adopted a range of diets from purely vegan to primarily carnivorous. In some cases, dietary restrictions in humans can lead to deficiency diseases; however, stable human groups have adapted to many dietary patterns through both genetic specialization and cultural conventions to use nutritionally balanced food sources.[222] The human diet is prominently reflected in human culture and has led to the development of food science.[223]\n\nUntil the development of agriculture, Homo sapiens employed a hunter-gatherer method as their sole means of food collection.[223] This involved combining stationary food sources (such as fruits, grains, tubers, and mushrooms, insect larvae and aquatic mollusks) with wild game, which must be hunted and captured in order to be consumed.[224] It has been proposed that humans have used fire to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus.[225] Human domestication of wild plants began about 11,700 years ago, leading to the development of agriculture,[226] a gradual process called the Neolithic Revolution.[227] These dietary changes may also have altered human biology; the spread of dairy farming provided a new and rich source of food, leading to the evolution of the ability to digest lactose in some adults.[228][229] The types of food consumed, and how they are prepared, have varied widely by time, location, and culture.[230][231]\n\nIn general, humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food, depending on stored body fat.[232] Survival without water is usually limited to three or four days, with a maximum of one week.[233] In 2020 it is estimated 9 million humans die every year from causes directly or indirectly related to starvation.[234][235] Childhood malnutrition is also common and contributes to the global burden of disease.[236] However, global food distribution is not even, and obesity among some human populations has increased rapidly, leading to health complications and increased mortality in some developed and a few developing countries. Worldwide, over one billion people are obese,[237] while in the United States 35% of people are obese, leading to this being described as an \"obesity epidemic.\"[238] Obesity is caused by consuming more calories than are expended, so excessive weight gain is usually caused by an energy-dense diet.[237]\n\nThere is biological variation in the human species – with traits such as blood type, genetic diseases, cranial features, facial features, organ systems, eye color, hair color and texture, height and build, and skin color varying across the globe. The typical height of an adult human is between 1.4 and 1.9 m (4 ft 7 in and 6 ft 3 in), although this varies significantly depending on sex, ethnic origin, and family bloodlines.[239][240] Body size is partly determined by genes and is also significantly influenced by environmental factors such as diet, exercise, and sleep patterns.[241]\n\nThere is evidence that populations have adapted genetically to various external factors. The genes that allow adult humans to digest lactose are present in high frequencies in populations that have long histories of cattle domestication and are more dependent on cow milk.[242] Sickle cell anemia, which may provide increased resistance to malaria, is frequent in populations where malaria is endemic.[243][244] Populations that have for a very long time inhabited specific climates tend to have developed specific phenotypes that are beneficial for those environments – short stature and stocky build in cold regions, tall and lanky in hot regions, and with high lung capacities or other adaptations at high altitudes.[245] Some populations have evolved highly unique adaptations to very specific environmental conditions, such as those advantageous to ocean-dwelling lifestyles and freediving in the Bajau.[246]\n\nHuman hair ranges in color from red to blond to brown to black, which is the most frequent.[247] Hair color depends on the amount of melanin, with concentrations fading with increased age, leading to grey or even white hair. Skin color can range from darkest brown to lightest peach, or even nearly white or colorless in cases of albinism.[248] It tends to vary clinally and generally correlates with the level of ultraviolet radiation in a particular geographic area, with darker skin mostly around the equator.[249] Skin darkening may have evolved as protection against ultraviolet solar radiation.[250] Light skin pigmentation protects against depletion of vitamin D, which requires sunlight to make.[251] Human skin also has a capacity to darken (tan) in response to exposure to ultraviolet radiation.[252][253]\n\nThere is relatively little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that occurs is at the individual level.[248][254][255] Much of human variation is continuous, often with no clear points of demarcation.[256][257][258][259] Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are almost as different from each other as two people from any two different population groups.[260][261][262] Dark-skinned populations that are found in Africa, Australia, and South Asia are not closely related to each other.[263][264]\n\nGenetic research has demonstrated that human populations native to the African continent are the most genetically diverse[265] and genetic diversity decreases with migratory distance from Africa, possibly the result of bottlenecks during human migration.[266][267] These non-African populations acquired new genetic inputs from local admixture with archaic populations and have much greater variation from Neanderthals and Denisovans than is found in Africa,[184] though Neanderthal admixture into African populations may be underestimated.[268] Furthermore, recent studies have found that populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly West Africa, have ancestral genetic variation which predates modern humans and has been lost in most non-African populations. Some of this ancestry is thought to originate from admixture with an unknown archaic hominin that diverged before the split of Neanderthals and modern humans.[269][270]\n\nHumans are a gonochoric species, meaning they are divided into male and female sexes.[271][272][273] The greatest degree of genetic variation exists between males and females. While the nucleotide genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%–0.5%, the genetic difference between males and females is between 1% and 2%. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15 cm (6 in) taller than females.[274][275] On average, men have about 40–50% more upper-body strength and 20–30% more lower-body strength than women at the same weight, due to higher amounts of muscle and larger muscle fibers.[276] Women generally have a higher body fat percentage than men.[277] Women have lighter skin than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D in females during pregnancy and lactation.[278] As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome-related conditions and disorders only affect either men or women.[279] After allowing for body weight and volume, the male voice is usually an octave deeper than the female voice.[280] Women have a longer life span in almost every population around the world.[281] There are intersex conditions in the human population, however these are rare.[282][283]\n\nThe human brain, the focal point of the central nervous system in humans, controls the peripheral nervous system. In addition to controlling \"lower\", involuntary, or primarily autonomic activities such as respiration and digestion, it is also the locus of \"higher\" order functioning such as thought, reasoning, and abstraction.[284] These cognitive processes constitute the mind, and, along with their behavioral consequences, are studied in the field of psychology.\n\nHumans have a larger and more developed prefrontal cortex than other primates, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition.[285][286] This has led humans to proclaim themselves to be more intelligent than any other known species.[287] Objectively defining intelligence is difficult, with other animals adapting senses and excelling in areas that humans are unable to.[288]\n\nThere are some traits that, although not strictly unique, do set humans apart from other animals.[289] Humans may be the only animals who have episodic memory and who can engage in \"mental time travel\".[290] Even compared with other social animals, humans have an unusually high degree of flexibility in their facial expressions.[291] Humans are the only animals known to cry emotional tears.[292] Humans are one of the few animals able to self-recognize in mirror tests[293] and there is also debate over to what extent humans are the only animals with a theory of mind.[294][295]\n\nHumans are generally diurnal. The average sleep requirement is between seven and nine hours per day for an adult and nine to ten hours per day for a child; elderly people usually sleep for six to seven hours. Having less sleep than this is common among humans, even though sleep deprivation can have negative health effects. A sustained restriction of adult sleep to four hours per day has been shown to correlate with changes in physiology and mental state, including reduced memory, fatigue, aggression, and bodily discomfort.[296]\n\nDuring sleep humans dream, where they experience sensory images and sounds. Dreaming is stimulated by the pons and mostly occurs during the REM phase of sleep.[297] The length of a dream can vary, from a few seconds up to 30 minutes.[298] Humans have three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven.[299] Dreamers are more likely to remember the dream if awakened during the REM phase. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware.[300] Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur or give a sense of inspiration.[301]\n\nHuman consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience or awareness of internal or external existence.[302] Despite centuries of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial,[303] being \"at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives\".[304] The only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that it exists.[305] Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Some philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is sensory experience itself, and access consciousness, which can be used for reasoning or directly controlling actions.[306] It is sometimes synonymous with 'the mind', and at other times, an aspect of it. Historically it is associated with introspection, private thought, imagination and volition.[307] It now often includes some kind of experience, cognition, feeling or perception. It may be 'awareness', or 'awareness of awareness', or self-awareness.[308] There might be different levels or orders of consciousness,[309] or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features.[310]\n\nThe process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses is known as cognition.[311] The human brain perceives the external world through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly by his or her experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time.[312] The nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. Cognitive psychology studies cognition, the mental processes underlying behavior.[313] Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, developmental psychology seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age.[314][315] This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or moral development. Psychologists have developed intelligence tests and the concept of intelligence quotient in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its distribution among population.[316]\n\nHuman motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a well-established theory that can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.[317] From a more general, philosophical perspective, human motivation can be defined as a commitment to, or withdrawal from, various goals requiring the application of human ability. Furthermore, incentive and preference are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. Volition may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and realization of goals in an optimal manner, a function beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as socialization.[318]\n\nEmotions are biological states associated with the nervous system[319][320] brought on by neurophysiological changes variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioral responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure.[321][322] They are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, creativity,[323] and motivation. Emotion has a significant influence on human behavior and their ability to learn.[324] Acting on extreme or uncontrolled emotions can lead to social disorder and crime,[325] with studies showing criminals may have a lower emotional intelligence than normal.[326]\n\nEmotional experiences perceived as pleasant, such as joy, interest or contentment, contrast with those perceived as unpleasant, like anxiety, sadness, anger, and despair.[327] Happiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some define it as experiencing the feeling of positive emotional affects, while avoiding the negative ones.[328][329] Others see it as an appraisal of life satisfaction or quality of life.[330] Recent research suggests that being happy might involve experiencing some negative emotions when humans feel they are warranted.[331]\n\nFor humans, sexuality involves biological, erotic, physical, emotional, social, or spiritual feelings and behaviors.[332][333] Because it is a broad term, which has varied with historical contexts over time, it lacks a precise definition.[333] The biological and physical aspects of sexuality largely concern the human reproductive functions, including the human sexual response cycle.[332][333] Sexuality also affects and is affected by cultural, political, legal, philosophical, moral, ethical, and religious aspects of life.[332][333] Sexual desire, or libido, is a basic mental state present at the beginning of sexual behavior. Studies show that men desire sex more than women and masturbate more often.[334]\n\nHumans can fall anywhere along a continuous scale of sexual orientation,[335] although most humans are heterosexual.[336][337] While homosexual behavior occurs in some other animals, only humans and domestic sheep have so far been found to exhibit exclusive preference for same-sex relationships.[336] Most evidence supports nonsocial, biological causes of sexual orientation,[336] as cultures that are very tolerant of homosexuality do not have significantly higher rates of it.[337][338] Research in neuroscience and genetics suggests that other aspects of human sexuality are biologically influenced as well.[339]\n\nLove most commonly refers to a feeling of strong attraction or emotional attachment. It can be impersonal (the love of an object, ideal, or strong political or spiritual connection) or interpersonal (love between humans).[340] When in love dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and other chemicals stimulate the brain's pleasure center, leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement.[341]\n\nHumanity's unprecedented set of intellectual skills were a key factor in the species' eventual technological advancement and concomitant domination of the biosphere.[345] Disregarding extinct hominids, humans are the only animals known to teach generalizable information,[346] innately deploy recursive embedding to generate and communicate complex concepts,[347] engage in the \"folk physics\" required for competent tool design,[348][349] or cook food in the wild.[350] Teaching and learning preserves the cultural and ethnographic identity of human societies.[351] Other traits and behaviors that are mostly unique to humans include starting fires,[352] phoneme structuring[353] and vocal learning.[354]\n\nWhile many species communicate, language is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a cultural universal.[355] Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open – an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols.[356][357] Human language also has the capacity of displacement, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.[150]\n\nLanguage differs from other forms of communication in that it is modality independent; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, audibly in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and through tactile media such as braille.[358] Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups.[359] There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including sign languages, and many thousands more that are extinct.[360]\n\nHuman arts can take many forms including visual, literary, and performing. Visual art can range from paintings and sculptures to film, fashion design, and architecture.[361] Literary arts can include prose, poetry, and dramas. The performing arts generally involve theatre, music, and dance.[362][363] Humans often combine the different forms (for example, music videos).[364] Other entities that have been described as having artistic qualities include food preparation, video games, and medicine.[365][366][367] As well as providing entertainment and transferring knowledge, the arts are also used for political purposes.[368]\n\nArt is a defining characteristic of humans and there is evidence for a relationship between creativity and language.[369] The earliest evidence of art was shell engravings made by Homo erectus 300,000 years before modern humans evolved.[370] Art attributed to H. sapiens existed at least 75,000 years ago, with jewellery and drawings found in caves in South Africa.[371][372] There are various hypotheses as to why humans have adapted to the arts. These include allowing them to better problem solve issues, providing a means to control or influence other humans, encouraging cooperation and contribution within a society or increasing the chance of attracting a potential mate.[373] The use of imagination developed through art, combined with logic may have given early humans an evolutionary advantage.[369]\n\nEvidence of humans engaging in musical activities predates cave art and so far music has been practiced by virtually all known human cultures.[374] There exists a wide variety of music genres and ethnic musics; with humans' musical abilities being related to other abilities, including complex social human behaviours.[374] It has been shown that human brains respond to music by becoming synchronized with the rhythm and beat, a process called entrainment.[375] Dance is also a form of human expression found in all cultures[376] and may have evolved as a way to help early humans communicate.[377] Listening to music and observing dance stimulates the orbitofrontal cortex and other pleasure sensing areas of the brain.[378]\n\nUnlike speaking, reading and writing does not come naturally to humans and must be taught.[379] Still, literature has been present before the invention of words and language, with 30,000-year-old paintings on walls inside some caves portraying a series of dramatic scenes.[380] One of the oldest surviving works of literature is the Epic of Gilgamesh, first engraved on ancient Babylonian tablets about 4,000 years ago.[381] Beyond simply passing down knowledge, the use and sharing of imaginative fiction through stories might have helped develop humans' capabilities for communication and increased the likelihood of securing a mate.[382] Storytelling may also be used as a way to provide the audience with moral lessons and encourage cooperation.[380]\n\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5 million years ago.[384] The use and manufacture of tools has been put forward as the ability that defines humans more than anything else[385] and has historically been seen as an important evolutionary step.[386] The technology became much more sophisticated about 1.8 million years ago,[385] with the controlled use of fire beginning around 1 million years ago.[387][388] The wheel and wheeled vehicles appeared simultaneously in several regions some time in the fourth millennium BC.[68] The development of more complex tools and technologies allowed land to be cultivated and animals to be domesticated, thus proving essential in the development of agriculture – what is known as the Neolithic Revolution.[389]\n\nChina developed paper, the printing press, gunpowder, the compass and other important inventions.[390] The continued improvements in smelting allowed forging of copper, bronze, iron and eventually steel, which is used in railways, skyscrapers and many other products.[391] This coincided with the Industrial Revolution, where the invention of automated machines brought major changes to humans' lifestyles.[392] Modern technology is observed as progressing exponentially,[393] with major innovations in the 20th century including: electricity, penicillin, semiconductors, internal combustion engines, the Internet, nitrogen fixing fertilizers, airplanes, computers, automobiles, contraceptive pills, nuclear fission, the green revolution, radio, scientific plant breeding, rockets, air conditioning, television and the assembly line.[394]\n\nDefinitions of religion vary;[395] according to one definition, a religion is a belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution and the history of the first religions have become areas of active scientific investigation.[396][397][398] Credible evidence of religious behaviour dates to the Middle Paleolithic era (45–200 thousand years ago).[399] It may have evolved to play a role in helping enforce and encourage cooperation between humans.[400]\n\nReligion manifests in diverse forms.[395] Religion can include a belief in life after death,[401] the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and moral or ethical teachings.[402] Views on transcendence and immanence vary substantially; traditions variously espouse monism, deism, pantheism, and theism (including polytheism and monotheism).[403]\n\nAlthough measuring religiosity is difficult,[404] a majority of humans profess some variety of religious or spiritual belief.[405] In 2015 the plurality were Christian followed by Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists.[406] As of 2015, about 16%, or slightly under 1.2 billion humans, were irreligious, including those with no religious beliefs or no identity with any religion.[407]\n\nAn aspect unique to humans is their ability to transmit knowledge from one generation to the next and to continually build on this information to develop tools, scientific laws and other advances to pass on further.[408] This accumulated knowledge can be tested to answer questions or make predictions about how the universe functions and has been very successful in advancing human ascendancy.[409]\n\nAristotle has been described as the first scientist,[410] and preceded the rise of scientific thought through the Hellenistic period.[411] Other early advances in science came from the Han dynasty in China and during the Islamic Golden Age.[412][94] The scientific revolution, near the end of the Renaissance, led to the emergence of modern science.[413]\n\nA chain of events and influences led to the development of the scientific method, a process of observation and experimentation that is used to differentiate science from pseudoscience.[414] An understanding of mathematics is unique to humans, although other species of animals have some numerical cognition.[415] All of science can be divided into three major branches, the formal sciences (e.g., logic and mathematics), which are concerned with formal systems, the applied sciences (e.g., engineering, medicine), which are focused on practical applications, and the empirical sciences, which are based on empirical observation and are in turn divided into natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, economics, sociology).[416]\n\nPhilosophy is a field of study where humans seek to understand fundamental truths about themselves and the world in which they live.[417] Philosophical inquiry has been a major feature in the development of humans' intellectual history.[418] It has been described as the \"no man's land\" between definitive scientific knowledge and dogmatic religious teachings.[419] Major fields of philosophy include metaphysics, epistemology, logic, and axiology (which includes ethics and aesthetics).[420]\n\nSociety is the system of organizations and institutions arising from interaction between humans. Humans are highly social and tend to live in large complex social groups. They can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, power, reputation and other factors. The structure of social stratification and the degree of social mobility differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.[421] Human groups range from the size of families to nations. The first form of human social organization is thought to have resembled hunter-gatherer band societies.[422]\n\nHuman societies typically exhibit gender identities and gender roles that distinguish between masculine and feminine characteristics and prescribe the range of acceptable behaviours and attitudes for their members based on their sex.[423][424] The most common categorisation is a gender binary of men and women.[425] Some societies recognize a third gender,[426] or less commonly a fourth or fifth.[427][428] In some other societies, non-binary is used as an umbrella term for a range of gender identities that are not solely male or female.[429]\n\nGender roles are often associated with a division of norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and power, with men enjoying more rights and privileges than women in most societies, both today and in the past.[430] As a social construct,[431] gender roles are not fixed and vary historically within a society. Challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.[432][433] Little is known about gender roles in the earliest human societies. Early modern humans probably had a range of gender roles similar to that of modern cultures from at least the Upper Paleolithic, while the Neanderthals were less sexually dimorphic and there is evidence that the behavioural difference between males and females was minimal.[434]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents, children and other descendants (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). There is also a third type applied to godparents or adoptive children (fictive). These culturally defined relationships are referred to as kinship. In many societies, it is one of the most important social organizing principles and plays a role in transmitting status and inheritance.[435] All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations is prohibited, and some also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations.[436]\n\nPair bonding is a ubiquitous feature of human sexual relationships, whether it is manifested as serial monogamy, polygyny, or polyandry.[437] Genetic evidence indicates that humans were predominantly polygynous for most of their existence as a species, but that this began to shift during the Neolithic, when monogamy started becoming widespread concomitantly with the transition from nomadic to sedentary societies.[438] Anatomical evidence in the form of second-to-fourth digit ratios, a biomarker for prenatal androgen effects, likewise indicates modern humans were polygynous during the Pleistocene.[439]\n\nHuman ethnic groups are a social category that identifies together as a group based on shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. These can be a common set of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.[440][441] Ethnicity is separate from the concept of race, which is based on physical characteristics, although both are socially constructed.[442] Assigning ethnicity to a certain population is complicated, as even within common ethnic designations there can be a diverse range of subgroups, and the makeup of these ethnic groups can change over time at both the collective and individual level.[176] Also, there is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes an ethnic group.[443] Ethnic groupings can play a powerful role in the social identity and solidarity of ethnopolitical units. This has been closely tied to the rise of the nation state as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.[444][445][446]\n\nAs farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between these different groups increased. This led to the development of governance within and between the communities.[447] Humans have evolved the ability to change affiliation with various social groups relatively easily, including previously strong political alliances, if doing so is seen as providing personal advantages.[448] This cognitive flexibility allows individual humans to change their political ideologies, with those with higher flexibility less likely to support authoritarian and nationalistic stances.[449]\n\nGovernments create laws and policies that affect the citizens that they govern. There have been many forms of government throughout human history, each having various means of obtaining power and the ability to exert diverse controls on the population.[450] Approximately 47% of humans live in some form of a democracy, 17% in a hybrid regime, and 37% in an authoritarian regime.[451] Many countries belong to international organizations and alliances; the largest of these is the United Nations, with 193 member states.[452]\n\nTrade, the voluntary exchange of goods and services, is seen as a characteristic that differentiates humans from other animals and has been cited as a practice that gave Homo sapiens a major advantage over other hominids.[453] Evidence suggests early H. sapiens made use of long-distance trade routes to exchange goods and ideas, leading to cultural explosions and providing additional food sources when hunting was sparse, while such trade networks did not exist for the now extinct Neanderthals.[454][455] Early trade likely involved materials for creating tools like obsidian.[456] The first truly international trade routes were around the spice trade through the Roman and medieval periods.[457]\n\nEarly human economies were more likely to be based around gift giving instead of a bartering system.[458] Early money consisted of commodities; the oldest being in the form of cattle and the most widely used being cowrie shells.[459] Money has since evolved into governmental issued coins, paper and electronic money.[459] Human study of economics is a social science that looks at how societies distribute scarce resources among different people.[460] There are massive inequalities in the division of wealth among humans; the eight richest humans are worth the same monetary value as the poorest half of all the human population.[461]\n\nHumans commit violence on other humans at a rate comparable to other primates, but have an increased preference for killing adults, infanticide being more common among other primates.[462] Phylogenetic analysis predicts that 2% of early H. sapiens would be murdered, rising to 12% during the medieval period, before dropping to below 2% in modern times.[463] There is great variation in violence between human populations, with rates of homicide about 0.01% in societies that have legal systems and strong cultural attitudes against violence.[464]\n\nThe willingness of humans to kill other members of their species en masse through organized conflict (i.e., war) has long been the subject of debate. One school of thought holds that war evolved as a means to eliminate competitors, and has always been an innate human characteristic. Another suggests that war is a relatively recent phenomenon and has appeared due to changing social conditions.[465] While not settled, current evidence indicates warlike predispositions only became common about 10,000 years ago, and in many places much more recently than that.[465] War has had a high cost on human life; it is estimated that during the 20th century, between 167 million and 188 million people died as a result of war.[466] War casualty data is less reliable for pre-medieval times, especially global figures. But compared with any period over the past 600 years, the last ~80 years (post 1946), has seen a very significant drop in global military and civilian death rates due to armed conflict.[467]Humans (TV Series 2015–2018) ⭐ 7.9 | Drama, Sci-Fi: Humans is an unexpectedly great show. The reason for this is that it's understated in the technology an emphasizes the humanity. The cast are all from UK and mostly unknown and it allows us to get to know the characters more. Gemma Chan who plays Anita/Mya led me to this series via her Twitter. I first saw her in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit.\n\n\n\nThis series is dark and brooding. It raises more questions than it answers with the interaction between the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Synths and the Humans who \"employ\" them to do ordinary household tasks.\n\n\n\nThe origins of the core group of Synths is a mystery that is weave through the course of this series. There is some limited action, violence and beneath all of that big question about the ghost in the machine. This may be the best follow-up on ideas of sentient robots first presented since Blade Runner.Humans (TV series) - Wikipedia: Humans is a science fiction television series that debuted in June 2015 on Channel 4 and on AMC. Written by Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent, based on the Swedish science fiction drama Real Humans, the series explores the themes of artificial intelligence, robotics, and their effects on the future of humanity, focusing on the social, cultural, and psychological impact of the invention and marketing of anthropomorphic robots called \"synths\".

In the reflex design, light travels through the lens and then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either a prism, which shows the image in the optical viewfinder, or the image sensor when the shutter release button is pressed. The viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured by the camera's sensor, as it presents it as a direct optical view through the main camera lens rather than showing an image through a separate secondary lens.\n\nDSLRs largely replaced film-based SLRs during the 2000s. Major camera manufacturers began to transition their product lines away from DSLR cameras to mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) beginning in the 2010s.\n\nIn 1969, Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith invented charge-coupled semiconductor devices, which can be used as analog storage registers and image sensors.[1] A CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) imager provides a low-noise analog image signal, which is digitized when used in a digital camera. For their contribution to digital photography, Boyle and Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.[2]\n\nIn 1973, Fairchild developed a 100 x 100 pixel interline CCD image sensor.[3] This CCD was used in the first commercial CCD camera, the Fairchild MV-100, which was introduced in late 1973. In 1974, Kodak scientists Peter Dillon and Albert Brault used this Fairchild CCD 202 image sensor to create the first color CCD image sensor by fabricating a red, green, and blue color filter array that was registered and bonded to the CCD.[4] In 1975, Kodak engineer Steven Sasson built the first portable, battery-operated digital still camera, which used a zoom lens from a Kodak Super 8mm movie camera and a monochrome Fairchild 100×100 pixel CCD.[5]\n\nThe first prototype filmless SLR camera was publicly demonstrated by Sony in August 1981. The Sony Mavica (a magnetic still video camera) used a color-striped 2/3” format CCD sensor with 280K pixels, along with analog video signal processing and recording.[6] The Mavica electronic still camera employed a TTL single-lens reflex viewfinder, as shown in the graphic from a June 1982 Sony press release. It recorded FM-modulated analog video signals on a newly developed 2” magnetic floppy disk, dubbed the \"Mavipak\".\n\nThe disk format was later standardized as the \"Still Video Floppy\", or \"SVF\", so the Sony Mavica was the first \"SVF-SLR\" to be demonstrated, but it was not a D-SLR since it recorded analog video images rather than digital images. Starting in 1983, many Japanese companies demonstrated prototype SVF cameras, including Toshiba, Canon, Copal, Hitachi, Panasonic, Sanyo, and Mitsubishi.[7]\n\nThe Canon RC-701, introduced in May 1986, was the first SVF camera (and the first SVF-SLR camera) sold in the US. It employed an SLR viewfinder and included a 2/3” format color CCD sensor with 380K pixels. It was sold along with removable 11-66mm and 50-150mm zoom lens.[8]\n\nOver the next five years, many other companies began selling SVF analog electronic cameras. These included the monochrome Nikon QV-1000C SVF-SLR camera, introduced in 1988,[7] which had an F-mount for interchangeable QV Nikkor lenses.\n\nIn 1986, the Kodak Microelectronics Technology Division developed a 1.3 MP CCD image sensor, the first with more than 1 million pixels. In 1987, this sensor was integrated with a Canon F-1 film SLR body at the Kodak Federal Systems Division to create an early DSLR camera.[9] The digital back monitored the camera body battery current to sync the image sensor exposure to the film body shutter.[10][11] Digital images were stored on a tethered hard drive and processed for histogram feedback to the user. This camera was created for the U.S. government, and was followed by several other models intended for government use and eventually Kodak DCS, a commercial DSLR series launched in 1991.[12][13][14]\n\nIn 1995, Nikon co-developed the Nikon E series with Fujifilm. The E series included the Nikon E2/E2S, Nikon E2N/E2NS and Nikon E3/E3S, with the E3S released in December 1999.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Sony introduced the \"Digital Mavica\" series of consumer digital cameras. Unlike the original analog Mavica, the Digital Mavica cameras recorded JPEG compressed image files on standard 3½-inch magnetic floppy discettes (meant to simplify camera-to-computer data transfer) and did not have an SLR viewfinder.\n\nIn 1999, Nikon announced the Nikon D1. The D1's body was similar to Nikon's professional 35 mm film SLRs, and it had the same Nikkor lens mount, allowing the D1 to use Nikon's existing line of AI/AIS manual focus and AF lenses. Although Nikon and other manufacturers had produced digital SLR cameras for several years prior, the D1 was the first professional digital SLR that displaced Kodak's then-undisputed reign over the professional market.[15]\n\nOver the next decade, other camera manufacturers entered the DSLR market, including Canon, Kodak, Fujifilm, Minolta (later Konica Minolta, and ultimately acquired by Sony), Pentax (whose camera division is now owned by Ricoh), Olympus, Panasonic, Samsung, Sigma, and Sony.\n\nIn January 2000, Fujifilm announced the FinePix S1 Pro, the first consumer-level DSLR.\n\nIn November 2001, Canon released its 4.1-megapixel EOS-1D, the brand's first professional digital body. In 2003, Canon introduced the 6.3-megapixel EOS 300D SLR camera (known in the United States and Canada as the Digital Rebel and in Japan as the Kiss Digital) with an MSRP of US$999, aimed at the consumer market. Its commercial success encouraged other manufacturers to produce competing digital SLRs, lowering entry costs and allowing more amateur photographers to purchase DSLRs.\n\nIn 2004, Konica Minolta released the Konica Minolta Maxxum 7D, the first DSLR with in-body image stabilization[16] which later become standard in Pentax, Olympus, and Sony Alpha cameras.\n\nIn early 2008, Nikon released the D90, the first DSLR to feature video recording. Since then, all major companies have offered cameras with this functionality.\n\nOver time, the number of megapixels in imaging sensors has increased steadily, with most companies focusing on high ISO performance, speed of focus, higher frame rates, the elimination of digital 'noise' produced by the imaging sensor, and price reductions to lure new customers.\n\nIn June 2012, Canon announced the first DSLR to feature a touchscreen, the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i/Kiss X6i. Although this feature had been widely used on both compact cameras and mirrorless models, it had not made an appearance on a DSLR until the 650D.[17]\n\nThe DSLR market is dominated by Japanese companies, and the top five manufacturers are Japanese: Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, and Sony. Other manufacturers of DSLRs include Mamiya, Sigma, Leica (Germany), and Hasselblad (Swedish).\n\nIn 2007, Canon edged out Nikon with 41% of worldwide sales to the latter's 40%, followed by Sony and Olympus, each with approximately 6% market share.[18] In the Japanese domestic market, Nikon captured 43.3% to Canon's 39.9%, with Pentax a distant third at 6.3%.[19]\n\nIn 2008, Canon's and Nikon's offerings took the majority of sales.[20] In 2010, Canon controlled 44.5% of the DSLR market, followed by Nikon with 29.8% and Sony with 11.9%.[21]\n\nFor Canon and Nikon, digital SLRs are their biggest source of profit. For Canon, their DSLRs brought in four times the profits from compact digital cameras, while Nikon earned more from DSLRs and lenses than from any other product.[22][23] Olympus and Panasonic have since exited the DSLR market and now focus on producing mirrorless cameras.\n\nIn 2013, after a decade of double-digit growth, DSLR (along with MILC) sales were down 15 per cent. This may be due to some low-end DSLR users choosing to use a smartphone instead. The market intelligence firm IDC predicted that Nikon would be out of business by 2018 if the trend continued, although this did not come to pass. Regardless, the market has shifted from being driven by hardware to software, and camera manufacturers have not been keeping up.[24]\n\nBeginning in the 2010s, major camera manufacturers began to transition their product lines away from DSLR cameras to mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs). In September 2013, Olympus announced they would stop the development of DSLR cameras and focus on the development of MILCs.[25] Nikon announced they were ending production of DSLRs in Japan in 2020, followed by similar announcements from Canon and Sony.[26][27][28]\n\nCurrently, DSLRs are widely used by consumers and professional still photographers. Well-established DSLRs currently offer a larger variety of dedicated lenses and other equipment. Mainstream DSLRs (in full-frame or smaller image sensor format) are produced by Canon, Nikon, Pentax, and Sigma. Pentax, Phase One, Hasselblad, and Mamiya Leaf produce expensive, high-end medium-format DSLRs, including some with removable sensor backs. Contax, Fujifilm, Kodak, Panasonic, Olympus, Samsung previously produced DSLRs but now either offer non-DSLR systems or have left the camera market entirely. Konica Minolta's line of DSLRs was purchased by Sony.\n• Canon's current 2018 EOS digital line includes the Canon EOS 1300D/Rebel T6, 200D/SL2, 800D/T7i, 77D, 80D, 7D Mark II, 6D Mark II, 5D Mark IV, 5Ds and 5Ds R and the 1D X Mark II. All Canon DSLRs with three- and four-digit model numbers, as well as the 7D Mark II, have APS-C sensors. The 6D, 5D series, and 1D X are full-frame. As of 2018 , all current Canon DSLRs use CMOS sensors.\n• Nikon has a broad line of DSLRs, most in direct competition with Canon's offerings, including the D3400, D5600, D7500 and D500 with APS-C sensors, and the D610, D750, D850, D5, D3X and the Df with full-frame sensors.\n• Pentax currently offers APS-C, full-frame and medium-format DSLRs. The APS-C cameras include the K-3 II, Pentax KP and K-S2. 29 The K-1 Mark II, announced in 2018 as successor to the Pentax K-1, is the current full-frame model. The APS-C and full-frame models have extensive backward compatibility with Pentax and third-party film era lenses from about 1975, those that use the Pentax K mount. The Pentax 645Z medium format DSLR is also back-compatible with Pentax 645 system lenses from the film era.\n• Sigma produces DSLRs using the Foveon X3 sensor, rather than the conventional Bayer sensor. This is claimed to give higher colour resolution, although headline pixel counts are lower than conventional Bayer-sensor cameras. It currently offers the entry-level SD15 and the professional SD1. Sigma is the only DSLR manufacturer that sells lenses for other brands' lens mounts.\n• Sony has modified the DSLR formula in favor of single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, 30 which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as the continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. As of July 2017 , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 per cent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop-loss light, but the rest of this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase-detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during the video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well. 31\n\nLike SLRs, DSLRs typically use interchangeable lenses with a proprietary lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system is switched down (to precisely a 45-degree angle) to direct light from the lens over a matte focusing screen via a condenser lens and a pentaprism/pentamirror to an optical viewfinder eyepiece. Most entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.\n\nFocusing can be manual, by twisting the focus on the lens; or automatic, activated by pressing half-way on the shutter release or a dedicated auto-focus (AF) button. To take an image, the mirror swings upwards in the direction of the arrow, the focal-plane shutter opens, and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor. After these actions, the shutter closes, the mirror returns to the 45-degree angle, and the built-in drive mechanism re-tensions the shutter for the next exposure.\n\nCompared with the newer concept of mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras, this mirror/prism system is the characteristic difference, providing direct, accurate optical preview with separate autofocus and exposure metering sensors. Essential parts of all digital cameras are some electronics like amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters, image processors, and other microprocessors for processing the digital image, performing data storage, and/or driving an electronic display.\n\nDSLRs typically use autofocus based on phase detection. This method allows the optimal lens position to be calculated rather than \"found\", as would be the case with autofocus based on contrast maximization. Phase-detection autofocus is typically faster than other passive techniques. As the phase sensor requires the same light going to the image sensor, it was previously only possible with an SLR design. However, with the introduction of focal-plane phase-detect autofocusing in mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras by Sony, Fuji, Olympus, and Panasonic, cameras can now employ both phase detect and contrast-detect AF points.\n\nDigital SLR cameras, along with most other digital cameras, generally have a mode dial to access standard camera settings or automatic scene-mode settings. Sometimes called a \"PASM\" dial, they typically provide modes such as program, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and full manual modes. Scene modes vary from camera to camera, and these modes are inherently less customizable. They often include landscape, portrait, action, macro, night, and silhouette, among others. However, these different settings and shooting styles that \"scene\" mode provides can be achieved by calibrating certain settings on the camera.\n\nA method to prevent dust from entering the chamber by using a \"dust cover\" filter right behind the lens mount was used by Sigma in its first DSLR, the Sigma SD9, in 2002.[citation needed]\n\nOlympus used a built-in sensor cleaning mechanism in its first DSLR that had a sensor exposed to air, the Olympus E-1, in 2003[citation needed] (all previous models each had a non-interchangeable lens, preventing direct exposure of the sensor to outside environmental conditions).\n\nSeveral Canon DSLR cameras rely on dust reduction systems based on vibrating the sensor at ultrasonic frequencies to remove dust from the sensor.[32]\n\nThe ability to exchange lenses, to select the best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialized lenses is one of the key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular. Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar, that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a camera body with a different lens mount, but with often reduced functionality.\n\nMany lenses are mountable, \"diaphragm-and-meter-compatible\", on modern DSLRs, and on older film SLRs that use the same lens mount. However, when lenses designed for 35 mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors, the image is effectively cropped and the lens appears to have a longer focal length than its stated focal length. Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimised for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing 35 mm mount DSLRs, mostly in the wide-angle range. These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full-frame sensors or 35 mm film because of the smaller imaging circle[33] and with some Canon EF-S lenses, interfere with the reflex mirrors on full-frame bodies.\n\nSince 2008, manufacturers have offered DSLRs which offer a movie mode capable of recording high definition motion video. A DSLR with this feature is often known as an HDSLR or DSLR video shooter.[34] The first DSLR introduced with an HD movie mode, the Nikon D90, captures video at 720p24 (1280x720 resolution at 24 frame/s). Other early HDSLRs capture video using a nonstandard video resolution or frame rate. For example, the Pentax K-7 uses a nonstandard resolution of 1536×1024, which matches the imager's 3:2 aspect ratio. The Canon EOS 500D (Rebel T1i) uses a nonstandard frame rate of 20 frame/s at 1080p, along with a more conventional 720p30 format.\n\nIn general, HDSLRs use the full imager area to capture HD video, though not all pixels (causing video artifacts to some degree). Compared with the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder, the HDSLR's much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics.[35] HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low-light performance. However, the low ratio of active pixels (to total pixels) is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts (such as moiré patterns) in scenes with particular textures, and CMOS rolling shutter tends to be more severe. Furthermore, due to the DSLR's optical construction, HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on standard dedicated camcorders, such as autofocus while shooting, powered zoom, and an electronic viewfinder/preview. These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point-and-shoot camcorder, instead of demanding some level of planning and skill for location shooting.\n\nVideo functionality has continued to improve since the introduction of the HDSLR, including higher video resolution (such as 1080p24) and video bitrate, improved automatic control (autofocus) and manual exposure control, and support for formats compatible with high-definition television broadcast, Blu-ray disc mastering[36] or Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI). The Canon EOS 5D Mark II (with the release of firmware version 2.0.3/2.0.4.[37]) and Panasonic Lumix GH1 were the first HDSLRs to offer 1080p video at 24fps, and since then the list of models with comparable functionality has grown considerably.[citation needed]\n\nThe rapid maturation of HDSLR cameras has sparked a revolution in digital filmmaking (referred to as \"DSLR revolution\"[38]), and the \"Shot On DSLR\" badge is a quickly growing phrase among independent filmmakers. Canon's North American TV advertisements featuring the Rebel T1i have been shot using the T1i itself. Other types of HDSLRs found their distinct application in the field of documentary and ethnographic filmmaking, especially due to their affordability, technical and aesthetical features, and their ability to make observation highly intimate.[38] An increased number of films, television shows, and other productions are utilizing the quickly improving features. One such project was Canon's \"Story Beyond the Still\" contest that asked filmmakers to collectively shoot a short film in 8 chapters, with each chapter being shot over a short period of time and a winner was determined for each chapter. After 7 chapters the winners collaborated to shoot the final chapter of the story. Due to the affordability and convenient size of HDSLRs compared with professional movie cameras, The Avengers used five Canon EOS 5D Mark II and two Canon 7D to shoot the scenes from various vantage angles throughout the set and reduced the number of reshoots of complex action scenes.[39]\n\nManufacturers have sold optional accessories to optimize a DSLR camera as a video camera, such as a shotgun-type microphone, and an External EVF with 1.2 million pixels.[40]\n\nEarly DSLRs lacked the ability to show the optical viewfinder's image on the LC display – a feature known as live preview. Live preview is useful in situations where the camera's eye-level viewfinder cannot be used, such as underwater photography where the camera is enclosed in a plastic waterproof case.\n\nIn 2000, Olympus introduced the Olympus E-10, the first DSLR with live preview – albeit with an atypical fixed lens design. In late 2008 , some DSLRs from Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Leica, Pentax, Samsung and Sony all provided continuous live preview as an option. Additionally, the Fujifilm FinePix S5 Pro[41] offers 30 seconds of live preview.\n\nOn almost all DSLRs that offer live preview via the primary sensor, the phase-detection autofocus system does not work in the live preview mode, and the DSLR switches to a slower contrast system commonly found in point-and-shoot cameras. While even phase detection autofocus requires contrast in the scene, strict contrast-detection autofocus is limited in its ability to find focus quickly, though it is somewhat more accurate.\n\nIn 2012, Canon introduced hybrid autofocus technology to the DSLR in the EOS 650D/Rebel T4i, and introduced a more sophisticated version, which it calls \"Dual Pixel CMOS AF\", with the EOS 70D. The technology allows certain pixels to act as both contrast-detection and phase-detection pixels, thereby greatly improving autofocus speed in live view (although it remains slower than pure phase detection). While several mirrorless cameras, plus Sony's fixed-mirror SLTs, have similar hybrid AF systems, Canon is the only manufacturer that offers such technology in DSLRs.\n\nA new feature via a separate software package introduced from Breeze Systems in October 2007, features live view from a distance. The software package is named \"DSLR Remote Pro v1.5\" and enables support for the Canon EOS 40D and 1D Mark III.[42]\n\nImage sensors used in DSLRs come in a range of sizes. The very largest are the ones used in \"medium format\" cameras, typically via a \"digital back\" which can be used as an alternative to a film back. Because of the manufacturing costs of these large sensors, the price of these cameras is typically over $1,500 and easily reaching $8,000 and beyond as of February 2021 .\n\n\"Full-frame\" is the same size as 35 mm film (135 film, image format 24×36 mm); these sensors are used in DSLRs such as the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, 5DS/5DSR, 5D Mark IV and 6D Mark II, and the Nikon D5, D850, D750, D610 and Df. Most lower-cost DSLRs use a smaller sensor that is APS-C sized, which is approximately 24×16 mm, slightly smaller than the size of an APS-C film frame, or about 40% of the area of a full-frame sensor. Other sensor sizes found in DSLRs include the Four Thirds System sensor at 26% of full frame, APS-H sensors (used, for example, in the Canon EOS-1D Mark III) at around 61% of full frame, and the original Foveon X3 sensor at 33% of full frame (although Foveon sensors since 2013 have been APS-C sized). Leica offers an \"S-System\" DSLR with a 30×45 mm array containing 37 million pixels.[43] This sensor is 56% larger than a full-frame sensor.\n\nThe resolution of DSLR sensors is typically measured in megapixels. More expensive cameras and cameras with larger sensors tend to have higher megapixel ratings. A larger megapixel rating does not mean higher quality. Low light sensitivity is a good example of this. When comparing two sensors of the same size, for example, two APS-C sensors one 12.1 MP and one 18 MP, the one with the lower megapixel rating will usually perform better in low light. This is because the size of the individual pixels is larger, and more light is landing on each pixel, compared with the sensor with more megapixels. This is not always the case, because newer cameras that have higher megapixels also have better noise reduction software, and higher ISO settings to make up for the loss of light per pixel due to higher pixel density.\n\nThe lenses typically used on DSLRs have a wider range of apertures available to them, ranging from as large as f/0.9 to about f/32. Lenses for smaller sensor cameras rarely have true available aperture sizes much larger than f/2.8 or much smaller than f/5.6.\n\nTo help extend the exposure range, some smaller sensor cameras will also incorporate an ND filter pack into the aperture mechanism.[46]\n\nThe apertures that smaller sensor cameras have available give much more depth of field than equivalent angles of view on a DSLR. For example, a 6 mm lens on a 2/3″ sensor digicam has a field of view similar to a 24 mm lens on a 35 mm camera. At an aperture of f/2.8, the smaller sensor camera (assuming a crop factor of 4) has a similar depth of field to that 35 mm camera set to f/11.\n\nThe angle of view of a lens depends upon its focal length and the camera's image sensor size; a sensor smaller than 35 mm film format (36×24 mm frame) gives a narrower angle of view for a lens of a given focal length than a camera equipped with a full-frame (35 mm) sensor. As of 2017, only a few current DSLRs have full-frame sensors, including the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II, EOS 5D Mark IV, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS 6D Mark II; Nikon's D5, D610, D750, D850, and Df; and the Pentax K-1. The scarcity of full-frame DSLRs is partly a result of the cost of such large sensors. Medium format size sensors, such as those used in the Mamiya ZD among others, are even larger than full-frame (35 mm) sensors, and capable of even greater resolution, and are correspondingly more expensive.\n\nThe impact of sensor size on the field of view is referred to as the \"crop factor\" or \"focal length multiplier\", which is a factor by which a lens focal length can be multiplied to give the full-frame-equivalent focal length for a lens. Typical APS-C sensors have crop factors of 1.5 to 1.7, so a lens with a focal length of 50 mm will give a field of view equal to that of a 75 mm to 85 mm lens on a 35 mm camera. The smaller sensors of Four Thirds System cameras have a crop factor of 2.0.\n\nWhile the crop factor of APS-C cameras effectively narrows the angle of view of long-focus (telephoto) lenses, making it easier to take close-up images of distant objects, wide-angle lenses suffer a reduction in their angle of view by the same factor.\n\nDSLRs with \"crop\" sensor size have slightly more depth-of-field than cameras with 35 mm sized sensors for a given angle of view. The amount of added depth of field for a given focal length can be roughly calculated by multiplying the depth of field by the crop factor. Shallower depth of field is often preferred by professionals for portrait work and to isolate a subject from its background.\n\nOn July 13, 2007, FujiFilm announced the FinePix IS Pro, which uses Nikon F-mount lenses. This camera, in addition to having live preview, has the ability to record in the infrared and ultraviolet spectra of light.[47]\n\nIn August 2010 Sony released series of DSLRs allowing 3D photography. It was accomplished by sweeping the camera horizontally or vertically in Sweep Panorama 3D mode. The picture could be saved as ultra-wide panoramic image or as 16:9 3D photography to be viewed on BRAVIA 3D television set.[48][49]\n\nThe reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera's sensor is also the image that is seen through the viewfinder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the viewfinder – hence the name \"single-lens reflex\". While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera's screen to be used as an electronic viewfinder. However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.\n\nCompared with some low-cost cameras that provide an optical viewfinder that uses a small auxiliary lens, the DSLR design has the advantage of being parallax-free: it never provides an off-axis view. A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used, it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture. Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display – for them, this has become the de facto way to use a camera. Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror (down or up), the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor. Therefore, many early DSLRs did not provide \"live preview\" (i.e., focusing, framing, and depth-of-field preview using the display), a facility that is always available on digicams. Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder.\n\nThe larger, advanced digital cameras offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level electronic viewfinder (EVF) in addition to the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has the lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being \"updated\" at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the \"resolution\" of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder, which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and \"micro-photography\" (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.\n\nDSLR cameras often have image sensors of much larger size and often higher quality, offering lower noise,[50] which is useful in low light. Although mirrorless digital cameras with APS-C and full frame sensors exist, most full frame and medium format sized image sensors are still seen in DSLR designs.\n\nFor a long time, DSLRs offered faster and more responsive performance, with less shutter lag, faster autofocus systems, and higher frame rates. Around 2016–17, some mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects. The downside of these cameras being that they do not have an optical viewfinder, making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial. Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture (time measured from pressing the shutter release to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium) than DSLR cameras, but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in-camera processing chips. Still, compact digital cameras are not suited for action, wildlife, sports, and other photography requiring a high burst rate (frames per second).\n\nSimple point-and-shoot cameras rely almost exclusively on their built-in automation and machine intelligence for capturing images under a variety of situations and offer no manual control over their functions, a trait that makes them unsuitable for use by professionals, enthusiasts, and proficient consumers (also known as \"prosumers\"). Bridge cameras provide some degree of manual control over the camera's shooting modes, and some even have hot shoes and the option to attach lens accessories such as filters and secondary converters. DSLRs typically provide the photographer with full control over all the important parameters of photography and have the option to attach additional accessories using the hot shoe.[51] including hot shoe-mounted flash units, battery grips for additional power and hand positions, external light meters, and remote controls. DSLRs typically also have fully automatic shooting modes.\n\nDSLRs have a larger focal length for the same field of view, which allows the creative use of depth of field effects. However, small digital cameras can focus better on closer objects than typical DSLR lenses.\n\nThe sensors used in current DSLRs — \"full-frame\" which is the same size as 35mm film, APS-C, and Four Thirds System — are much larger than most digital cameras. Entry-level compact cameras typically use sensors known as 1/2.3″, which is 3% the size of a full-frame sensor. There are fixed-lens cameras — such as bridge cameras, premium compact cameras, or high-end point-and-shoot cameras — that offer sensors larger than 1/2.3″, but many still fall short of the larger sizes widely found in DSLRs. Examples include the Sigma DP1, which uses a Foveon X3 sensor; the Leica X1; the Canon PowerShot G1 X, which uses a 1.5″ (18.7×14 mm) sensor that is slightly larger than the Four Thirds standard and is 30% of a full-frame sensor; the Nikon Coolpix A, which uses an APS-C sensor of the same size as those found in the company's DX-format DSLRs; and two models from Sony, the RX100 with a 1″-type (13.2×8.8 mm) sensor with about half the area of Four Thirds and the full-frame Sony RX1. These premium compacts are often comparable to entry-level DSLRs in price, with a smaller sensor being a tradeoff for the size and weight savings.\n\nUnlike DSLRs, most digital cameras lack the option to change the lens. Instead, most compact digital cameras are manufactured with a zoom lens that covers the most commonly used fields of view. Having fixed lenses, they are limited to the focal lengths they are manufactured with, except for what is available from attachments. Manufacturers have attempted (with increasing success) to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of focal length on models known as superzooms, some of which offer far longer focal lengths than readily available DSLR lenses.\n\nThere are now available perspective-correcting (PC) lenses for DSLR cameras, providing some of the attributes of view cameras. Nikon introduced the first fully manual PC lens in 1961. Recently, however, some manufacturers have introduced advanced lenses that shift and tilt and are operated with automatic aperture control.\n\nHowever, since the introduction of the Micro Four Thirds system by Olympus and Panasonic in late 2008, mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are now widely available. Hence, the option to change lenses is no longer unique to DSLRs. Cameras for the micro four-thirds system are designed with the option of a replaceable lens, and lenses that conform to this proprietary specification are accepted. Cameras for this system have the same sensor size as the Four-Thirds System but do not have the mirror and pentaprism to reduce the distance between the lens and sensor.\n\nPanasonic released the first Micro Four Thirds camera, the Lumix DMC-G1. Several manufacturers have announced lenses for the new Micro Four Thirds mount. In contrast, older Four-Thirds lenses can be mounted with an adapter (a mechanical spacer with front and rear electrical connectors and its own internal firmware). A similar mirror-less interchangeable lens camera with an APS-C-sized sensor was announced in January 2010: the Samsung NX10. On 21 September 2011, Nikon announced with the Nikon 1 a series of high-speed MILCs. A handful of rangefinder cameras also support interchangeable lenses. Six digital rangefinders exist: the Epson R-D1 (APS-C-sized sensor), the Leica M8 (APS-H-sized sensor), both smaller than 35 mm film rangefinder cameras, and the Leica M9, M9-P, M Monochrom and M (Typ 240) (all full-frame cameras, with the Monochrom shooting exclusively in black-and-white).\n\nIn common with other interchangeable lens designs, DSLRs must contend with potential sensor contamination by dust particles when the lens is changed (though recent dust reduction systems alleviate this). Digital cameras with fixed lenses are not usually subject to dust from outside the camera settling on the sensor.\n\nDSLRs generally have more significant cost, size, and weight.[52] They also have louder operation, due to the SLR mirror mechanism.[53] Sony's fixed mirror design manages to avoid this problem. However, that design has the disadvantage that the mirror diverts some of the light received from the lens, and thus, the image sensor receives about 30% less light compared with other DSLR designs.NCBI - WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic: Your access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

I've been using a company Canon EOS 4000D for about a year, and in the meantime I've picked up a taste for photography, so I decided to pick up a camera of my own for personal use. Being that, as time went, I've bought a bunch of Canon compatible accesories (lenses, flashes, etc.), I'd prefer to make use of them going forward, so I'm leaning into Canon. So, going in my local market, with a budget that can get me a bit more than half of a brand new 4000D, i found pretty well maitained examples of 60Ds and 70Ds, as well as heavy used and older 5Ds and 6Ds. Out of these, the 70D seemed the most appealing, but the model being more than 10 years old brought up a question: Is it still good enough to this day? I'm not planning to go pro on it or anything, I just want to use something decent to up my game untill I can justify breaking the bank on full frame DSLRs or modern mirrorless cameras.Amazon.com: Paquete Canon 70D : Electrónica: De las mejores compras que he hecho en Amazon.

The EOS 70D also boasts the advanced Movie Digital Zoom, allowing you to magnify the center of the image by approximately 3x–10x when Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution is set.\n\n \n\n The EOS 70D features Movie Servo AF for continuous autofocus tracking of moving subjects while recording video. Combined with the camera’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF system, even fast subjects remain crisply in focus. Autofocus is smooth and continuous, and quiet when recording video using one of Canon’s STM lenses. The revolutionary performance of Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF System, the predictive power of Movie Servo AF, and the pleasing depth-of-field provided by the EOS 70D’s optics make it possible to accomplish stunning, cinematic video capture, easily. The EOS 70D comes with a Vari-angle Touch Screen 3.0-inch Clear View LCD monitor II for shooting videos and stills at a variety of angles, high or low, with up to 180° of rotation. Using capacitive technology similar to today’s popular mobile devices, this screen is touch-sensitive and delivers intuitive touch panel operation. Two-finger touch gestures can be used for zooming or changing images. Menu and quick control settings can be accessed, and focus point and shutter release can be activated with the touch of a fingertip using Touch AF. Displaying fine detail (at approximately 1.04 million dots), this screen is perfect for composing and reviewing images. Thanks to a solid construction between the monitor’s resin-coated cover and the liquid crystal display, reflections are minimized, and the display can be viewed, without glare, from any number of angles. The LCD’s surface is treated with a smudge-resistant coating to minimize fingerprints and maintain a bright, clear image display. The EOS 70D has a high-performance AF system that’s ready for anything. The camera features 19 high precision cross-type AF sensors, all of which can be selected automatically or manually. With cross-type AF points placed throughout a wide area, the EOS 70D’s AF system ensures amazing compositional flexibility whether shooting vertically or horizontally, and is superbly equipped to track the subject, even if movements are erratic or unpredictable. And with its high-precision f/2.8 dual cross-type AF center point, the EOS 70D delivers a whole new level of focus accuracy when shooting with lenses of f/2.8 or faster. The EOS 70D camera’s AF modes can be customized to suit the situation, helping ensure reliable focus. The EOS 70D camera’s Intelligent Viewfinder offers a sharp, bright, approximately 98% field of view with an approximate magnification of 0.95x, a viewing angle of 27.9° and a 22mm eyepoint. Featuring a new coating that reduces reflections and new construction that improves response in cold environments, the EOS 70D’s Intelligent Viewfinder makes it simple to adjust and confirm settings without the risk of missing a beat. The Intelligent Viewfinder uses a transparent LCD to superimpose a customizable combination of focus points and gridlines directly over the image: it displays AF mode, AF points, electronic level, grid, alerts informing when white balance is being corrected and when Spot metering is enabled, and much more. With the EOS 70D’s Intelligent Viewfinder, unlike with other cameras, the photographer has the choice of seeing shooting information or looking only at the scene in front of the camera. The ability to effectively erase all shooting data and turn it back on with the touch of a button gives the photographer the opportunity to concentrate simply on looking and composing the photograph without distraction, a great advantage in numerous shooting situations. With its High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode, the EOS 70D can merge three images of varying exposure in-camera and save them as one final image, capturing a broad range of shadow and highlight detail with stunning tonal range. Adjustable to cover a range of Â±3 stops, HDR recording truly expands the parameters of the light and dark detail a camera can actually record, surprising viewers with the range of tones a photograph can accurately recreate. The EOS 70D offers a Multiple Exposure mode for film-like image creation with the convenience of in-camera processing. It offers two different compositing methods for proper exposure and composition: additive or average. Multiple exposure shots from 2 to 9 are stored as one final image and can be taken in both RAW and JPEG shooting modes. A RAW image previously captured by the EOS 70D (3:2 aspect ratio only) can be used as a starting point, and cumulative results can be observed and corrected in real time on the camera's LCD screen. To help explain the specific function of features found on the EOS 70D, the Feature Guide displays a simple description helpful in determining the applicability for the situation at hand. It is displayed in each shooting mode, during mode dial operations, and for Quick Control screen functions. It appears automatically when a function is selected – a lifesaver when trying to determine the best mode or function for the next picture. The feature guide works automatically by default, and can be disabled easily through the camera’s menu."}

Not to mention Furhman now being an obvious adult, it just seemed strange and destined to fail.\n\nHowever, I have to give massive praise to all involved that they kind of acknowledged there wasn’t much else to do rather than lean into the first films admitted craziness.

Broad elements include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs.\n\nHorror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of Dracula (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, erotic horror, slasher films, splatter films, supernatural horror, and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, and Thailand, among other countries.\n\nDespite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons.\n\nThe Dictionary of Film Studies defines the horror film as representing “disturbing and dark subject matter, seeking to elicit responses of fear, terror, disgust, shock, suspense, and, of course, horror from their viewers.”[2] In the chapter The American Nightmare: Horror in the 70s from Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan (2002), film critic Robin Wood declared that the commonality between horror films is that “normality is threatened by the monster.” This was further expanded upon by The Philosophy of Horror, or Parodoxes of the Heart by Noël Carroll who added that “repulsion must be pleasurable, as evidenced by the genre's popularity.”\n\nPrior to the release of Dracula (1931), historian Gary Don Rhodes explained that the idea and terminology of horror film did not exist yet as a codified genre, although critics used the term “horror” to describe films in reviews prior to Dracula's release. “Horror” was a term used to describe a variety of meanings. In 1913, Moving Picture World defined “horrors” as showcasing “striped convicts, murderous Indians, grinning 'black-handers', homicidal drunkards” Some titles that suggest horror such as The Hand of Horror (1914) was a melodrama about a thief who steals from his own sister. During the silent era, the term horror was used to describe everything from “battle scenes” in war films to tales of drug addiction. Rhodes concluded that the term “horror film” or “horror movie” was not used in early cinema.\n\nThe mystery film genre was in vogue and early information on Dracula being promoted as a mystery film was common, despite the novel, play and the film's story relying on the supernatural. Newman discussed the genre in British Film Institute's Companion to Horror where he noted that Horror films in the 1930s were easy to identify, but following that decade, “the more blurred distinctions become, and horror becomes less like a discrete genre than an effect which can be deployed within any number of narrative settings or narrative patterns”. In the 1940s, the horror film was viewed in different terms. Critic Siegfried Kracauer included The Lost Weekend among films described as “terror films” along with Shadow of a Doubt, The Dark Corner (1946), Gaslight (1944), Shock (1946), The Spiral Staircase (1946), The Stranger (1946) Spellbound (1945) while two years earlier, the New York Times described a new cycle of “horror” productions included Gaslight, The Woman in the Window (1944), Dark Waters (1944), Laura and Phantom Lady (1944). Mark Jancovich wrote in The Shifting Definitions of Genre: Essays on Labeling Films, Television Shows and Media (2008) that the term was virtually synonymous with mystery as a generic term, not being limited to films concerned with the strange, eerie and uncanny.\n\nVarious writings on genre from Altman, Lawrence Alloway (Violent America: The Movies 1946-1964 (1971)) and Peter Hutchings (Approaches to Popular Film (1995)) implied it is easier to view films as cycles opposed to genres, suggesting the slasher film viewed as a cycle would place it in terms of how the film industry was economically and production wise, the personnel involved in their respective eras, and how the films were marketed exhibited and distributed. Mark Jancovich in an essay, declared that “there is no simple 'collective belief' as to what constitutes the horror genre” between both fans and critics of the genre. Jancovich found that disagreements existed from audiences who wanted to distinguish themselves. This ranged from fans of different genres who may view a film like Alien (1979) as belonging to science fiction, and horror fan bases dismissing it as being inauthentic to either genre. Further debates exist among fans of the genre with personal definitions of “true” horror films, such as fans who embrace cult figures like Freddy Kruger of the A Nightmare on Elm Street series, while others disassociate themselves from characters and series and focusing on genre auteur directors like Dario Argento, while others fans would deem Argento's films as too mainstream, having preferences more underground films. Andrew Tudor wrote in Monsters and Mad Scientists: A Cultural History of the Horror Movie suggested that “Genre is what we collectively believe it to be”\n\nIn addition to these perspectives, Rhodes emphasizes the evolution of the horror genre through various cultural and historical contexts. He discusses the impact of socio-political factors on the genre, such as the influence of World War I and II, the Great Depression, and the Cold War, which shaped the themes and narratives of horror films. For instance, the anxieties of the post-war era manifested in horror films as fears of invasion, contamination, and the unknown, reflecting the collective psyche of the time. Rhodes also highlights the significance of technological advancements, such as the advent of sound in cinema, which revolutionized the horror genre by enhancing its ability to evoke fear and suspense through auditory effects.\n\nMoreover, the horror genre's flexibility and adaptability are crucial to its enduring popularity. As Rhodes notes, the genre continuously evolves, incorporating elements from other genres and responding to contemporary societal fears and anxieties. This adaptability is evident in the various sub-genres that have emerged over the years, such as psychological horror, body horror, and found footage horror, each addressing different aspects of human fear and the unknown.\n\nRhodes also explores the role of censorship and regulation in shaping the horror genre. The enforcement of the Hays Code in the 1930s and subsequent rating systems influenced the depiction of violence and sexuality in horror films. This regulation often pushed filmmakers to find creative ways to imply horror elements without explicit content, leading to a focus on atmosphere, suggestion, and psychological horror. The relaxation of censorship in the late 20th century allowed for more graphic and explicit horror, contributing to the emergence of sub-genres like splatter films and torture porn.\n\nIn a study by Jacob Shelton, the many ways that audience members are manipulated through horror films was investigated in detail.[19] Negative space is one such method that can play a part in inducing a reaction, causing one's eyes to remotely rest on anything in the frame – a wall, or the empty black void in the shadows.[19]\n\nThe jump scare is a horror film trope, where an abrupt change in image accompanied with a loud sound intends to surprise the viewer.[19] This can also be subverted to create tension, where an audience may feel more unease and discomfort by anticipating a jump scare.[19]\n\nMirrors are often used in horror films to create visual depth and build tension. Shelton argues mirrors have been used so frequently in horror films that audiences have been conditioned to fear them, and subverting audience expectations of a jump scare in a mirror can further build tension.[19] Tight framing and close-ups are also commonly used; these can build tension and induce anxiety by not allowing the viewer to see beyond what is around the protagonist.[19]\n\nThe interaction between horror films and their audiences is another significant aspect discussed by Rhodes. He notes that horror films often serve as a safe space for viewers to confront and process their fears. This cathartic experience can provide psychological relief and a sense of empowerment as viewers face and overcome their anxieties in a controlled environment. The communal experience of watching horror films in theaters or discussing them in fan communities also plays a crucial role in the genre's impact and popularity.[6]\n\nMusic is a key component of horror films. In Music in the Horror Film (2010), Lerner writes \"music in horror film frequently makes us feel threatened and uncomfortable\" and intends to intensify the atmosphere created in imagery and themes. Dissonance, atonality and experiments with timbre are typical characteristics used by composers in horror film music.[20]\n\nIn the book Dark Dreams, author Charles Derry conceived horror films as focusing on three broad themes: the horror of personality, horror of Armageddon and the horror of the demonic. The horror of personality derives from monsters being at the centre of the plot, such Frankenstein's monster whose psychology makes them perform unspeakable horrific acts ranging from rapes, mutilations and sadistic killings. Other key works of this form are Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which feature psychotic murderers without the make-up of a monster. The second 'Armageddon' group delves on the fear of large-scale destruction, which ranges from science fiction works but also of natural events, such as Hitchcock's The Birds (1963). The last group of the “Fear of the Demonic” features graphic accounts of satanic rites, witchcraft, exorcisms outside traditional forms of worship, as seen in films like The Exorcist (1973) or The Omen (1976).\n\nSome critics have suggested horror films can be a vessel for exploring contemporary cultural, political and social trends. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements.[23] The use of horror films can help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to depict the horrors of the Vietnam War, the Holocaust, the worldwide AIDS epidemic[24] or post-9/11 pessimism. In many occurrences, the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate,[according to whom?] yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life.[clarification needed][26]\n\nHorror is a malleable genre and often can be altered to accommodate other genre types such as science fiction, making some films difficult to categorize.\n\nNamed after American author H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937), this sub-genre of horror films include themes of cosmic dread, forbidden and dangerous knowledge, madness, non-human influences on humanity, religion and superstition, fate and inevitability, and the risks associated with scientific discoveries.\n\nA genre that emerged in the 1970s, body horror films focus on the process of a bodily transformation. In these films, the body is either engulfed by some larger process or heading towards fragmentation and collapse. The focus can be on apocalyptic implication of an entire society being overtaken, but the focus is generally upon an individual and their sense of identity, primarily them watching their own body change. The earliest appearance of the sub-genre was the work of director David Cronenberg, specifically with early films like Shivers (1975). Mark Jancovich of the University of Manchester declared that the transformation scenes in the genre provoke fear and repulsion, but also pleasure and excitement such as in The Thing (1982) and The Fly (1986).\n\nChristmas horror is a film subgenre that emerged in the 1970s with films such as Whoever Slew Auntie Roo? (1971) and Silent Night, Bloody Night (1972), which were soon followed by the influential Black Christmas (1974). Defining the Christmas horror genre has been described as challenging, as it has generally been regarded as a sub-genre of the slasher film. Adam Rockoff, in Rue Morgue, noted that the sub-genre sits within a trend of holiday-themed slasher films, alongside films such as My Bloody Valentine (1981) and April Fool's Day (1986). Others take a broader view that Christmas horror is not limited to the slasher genre, noting how it evolved from the English Christmas tradition of telling ghost stories. Christmas in literature has historically included elements of \"darkness\"—fright, misery, death and decay—tracing its literary antecedents as far back as the biblical account of the Massacre of the Innocents and more recently in works such as E. T. A. Hoffmann's \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" (1816) and Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol (1843). Although ghosts have largely been replaced by serial killers, Christmas horror creates an outlet through which to explore \"a modern reinvention of the Christmas ghost story\".\n\nErotic horror is a subgenre of horror fiction that blends sensual and sexual imagery with horrific themes for the sake of sexual arousal. Erotic horror has had influences on French[36] and American horror cinema. The works of Jean Rollin, such as Le Viol du Vampire and Fascination, are considered quintessential erotic horror films, blending deeply sexual imagery with gore.[36] American cinema has also featured notable erotic horror film franchises, such as Candyman.[37] An example of a British erotic horror film series is Hellraiser.[38] Alien features heavy erotic imagery, with the design of the Xenomorph by H. R. Giger featuring both phallic and vaginal imagery, intended to symbolize patriarchal guilt[39] as well as sex, rape, and pregnancy.[40]\n\nFolk horror uses elements of folklore or other religious and cultural beliefs to instil fear in audiences. Folk horror films have featured rural settings and themes of isolation, religion and nature.[41][42] Frequently cited examples are Witchfinder General (1968), The Blood on Satan's Claw (1971), The Wicker Man (1973), The Witch (2015), and Midsommar (2019).[41][42] Local folklore and beliefs have been noted as being prevalent in horror films from the Southeast Asia region, including Thailand and Indonesia.[43][44]\n\nThe found footage horror film \"technique\" gives the audience a first person view of the events on screen, and presents the footage as being discovered after. Horror films which are framed as being made up of \"found-footage\" merge the experiences of the audience and characters, which may induce suspense, shock, and bafflement.[45] Alexandra Heller-Nicholas noted that the popularity of sites like YouTube in 2006 sparked a taste for amateur media, leading to the production of further films in the found footage horror genre later in the 2000s including the particularly financially successful Paranormal Activity (2007).\n\nIn their book Gothic film, Richard J. McRoy and Richard J. Hand stated that \"Gothic\" can be argued as a very loose subgenre of horror, but argued that \"Gothic\" as a whole was a style like film noir and not bound to certain cinematic elements like the Western or science fiction film. The term \"gothic\" is frequently used to describe a stylized approach to showcasing location, desire, and action in film. Contemporary views of the genre associate it with imagery of castles at hilltops and labyrinth like ancestral mansions that are in various states of disrepair. Narratives in these films often focus on an audience's fear and attraction to social change and rebellion. The genre can be applied to films as early as The Haunted Castle (1896), Frankenstein (1910) as well as to more complex iterations such as Park Chan-wook's Stoker (2013) and Jordan Peele's Get Out (2017).\n\nThe gothic style is applied to several films throughout the history of the horror film. This includes Universal Pictures' horror films of the 1930s, the revival of gothic horror in the 1950s and 1960s with films from Hammer, Roger Corman's Poe-cycle, and several Italian productions. By the 1970s American and British productions often had vampire films set in a contemporary setting, such as Hammer Films had their Dracula stories set in a modern setting and made other horror material which pushed the erotic content of their vampire films that was initiated by Black Sunday. In the 1980s, the older horror characters of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster rarely appeared, with vampire themed films continued often in the tradition of authors like Anne Rice where vampirism becomes a lifestyle choice rather than plague or curse. Following the release of Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), a small wave of high-budgeted gothic horror romance films were released in the 1990s.\n\nAlso described as \"eco-horror\", the natural horror film is a subgenre \"featuring nature running amok in the form of mutated beasts, carnivorous insects, and normally harmless animals or plants turned into cold-blooded killers.\"[56] In 1963, Alfred Hitchcock defined a new genre nature taking revenge on humanity with The Birds (1963) that was expanded into a trend into the 1970s. Following the success of Willard (1971), a film about killer rats, 1972 had similar films with Stanley (1972) and an official sequel Ben (1972). Other films followed in suit such as Night of the Lepus (1972), Frogs (1972), Bug (1975), Squirm (1976) and what Muir described as the \"turning point\" in the genre with Jaws (1975), which became the highest-grossing film at that point and moved the animal attacks genres \"towards a less-fantastic route\" with less giant animals and more real-life creatures such as Grizzly (1976) and Night Creature (1977), Orca (1977), and Jaws 2 (1978). The film is linked with the environmental movements that became more mainstream in the 1970s and early 1980s such vegetarianism, animal rights movements, and organizations such as Greenpeace. Following Jaws, sharks became the most popular animal of the genre, ranging from similar such as Mako: The Jaws of Death (1976) and Great White (1981) to the Sharknado film series. James Marriott found that the genre had \"lost momentum\" since the 1970s while the films would still be made towards the turn of the millennium.\n\nBill Gibron of PopMatters declared a mixed definition of the psychological horror film, ranging from definitions of anything that created a sense of disquiet or apprehension to a film where an audience's mind makes up what was not directly displayed visually. Gibron concluded it as a \"clouded gray area between all out splatter and a trip through a cinematic dark ride.\"\n\nReligious horror is a subgenre of horror film whose common themes are based on religion and focus heavily on supernatural beings, often with demons as the main antagonists that bring a sense of threat.[64][65] Such films commonly use religious elements, including the crucifix or cross, holy water, the Bible, the rosary, the sign of the cross, the church, and prayer, which are forms of religious symbols and rituals used to depict the use of faith to defeat evil.[66]\n\nThe slasher film is a horror subgenre which involves a killer murdering a group of people (often teenagers), usually by use of bladed tools.[67] In his book on the genre, author Adam Rockoff wrote that these villains represented a \"rogue genre\" of films that are \"tough, problematic, and fiercely individualistic.\" Following the financial success of Friday the 13th (1980), at least 20 other slasher films appeared in 1980 alone. These films usually revolved around three properties: unique social settings (campgrounds, schools, holidays) and a crime from the past committed (an accidental drowning, infidelity, a scorned lover) and a ready made group of victims (camp counselors, students, wedding parties). The genre was derided by several contemporary film critics of the era such as Ebert, and often were highly profitable in the box office. The release of Scream (1996), led to a brief revival of the slasher films for the 1990s. Other countries imitated the American slasher film revival, such as South Korea's early 2000s cycle with Bloody Beach (2000), Nightmare (2000) and The Record (2000).\n\nSplatter is a subgenre that depends on violence and gore to display and accentuate a fascination with the theatricality of mutilation and the vulnerability of the human body.[74]\n\nSupernatural horror films integrate supernatural elements, such as the afterlife, spirit possession and religion into the horror genre.[75]\n\nTeen horror is a horror subgenre that victimizes teenagers while usually promoting strong, anti-conformity teenage leads, appealing to young generations. This subgenre often depicts themes of sex, under-aged drinking, and gore.[76] Horror films aimed a young audience featuring teenage monsters grew popular in the 1950s with several productions from American International Pictures (AIP) and productions of Herman Cohen with I Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957) and I Was a Teenage Frankenstein (1957). This led to later productions like Daughter of Dr. Jekyll (1957) and Frankenstein's Daughter (1958). Teen horror cycle in the 1980s often showcased explicit gore and nudity, with John Kenneth Muir described as cautionary conservative tales where most of the films stated if you partook in such vices such as drugs or sex, your punishment of death would be handed out. Prior to Scream, there were no popular teen horror films in the early 1990s. After the financial success of Scream, teen horror films became increasingly reflexive and self-aware until the end of the 1990s with films like I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997) and non-slasher The Faculty (1998). The genre lost prominence as teen films dealt with threats with more realism in films like Donnie Darko (2001) and Crazy/Beautiful (2001). In her book on the 1990s teen horror cycle, Alexandra West described the general trend of these films is often looked down upon by critics, journals, and fans as being too glossy, trendy, and sleek to be considered worthwhile horror films.\n\nHorror films in Asia have been noted as being inspired by national, cultural or religious folklore, particularly beliefs in ghosts or spirits.[43][83] In Asian Horror, Andy Richards writes that there is a \"widespread and engrained acceptance of supernatural forces\" in many Asian cultures, and suggests this is related to animist, pantheist and karmic religious traditions, as in Buddhism and Shintoism.[83] Although Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Korean horror has arguably received the most international attention,[83] horror also makes up a considerable proportion of Cambodian[84] and Malaysian cinema.[85]\n\nIan Olney described the horror films of Europe were often more erotic and \"just plain stranger\" than their British and American counter-parts. European horror films (generally referred to as Euro Horror) draw from distinctly European cultural sources, including surrealism, romanticism, decadent tradition, early 20th century pulp-literature, film serials, and erotic comics. In comparison to the narrative logic in American genre films, these films focused on imagery, excessiveness, and the irrational.\n\nBetween the mid-1950s and the mid-1980s, European horror films emerged from countries like Italy, Spain and France, and were shown in the United States predominantly at drive-in theatre and grindhouse theaters. As producers and distributors all over the world were interested in horror films, regardless of their origin, changes started occurring in European low-budget filmmaking that allowed for productions in the 1960s and 1970s for horror films from Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain, as well as co-productions between these countries. Several productions, such as those in Italy, were co-productions due to the lack of international stars within the country. European horror films began developing strong cult following since the late 1990s.\n\nIt is unknown when Australia's cinema first horror title may have been, with thoughts ranging from The Strangler's Grip (1912) to The Face at the Window (1919) while stories featuring ghosts would appear in Guyra Ghost Mystery (1921). By 1913, the more prolific era of Australian cinema ended with production not returning with heavy input of government finance in the 1970s. It took until the 1970s for Australia to develop sound film with television films that eventually received theatrical release with Dead Easy (1970) and Night of Fear (1973). The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) was the first Australian horror production made for theatrical release. 1970s Australian art cinema was funded by state film corporations, who considered them more culturally acceptable than local exploitation films (Ozploitation), which was part of the Australian phenomenon called the cultural cringe. The greater success of genre films like Mad Max (1979), The Last Wave (1977) and Patrick (1978) led to the Australian Film Commission to change its focus to being a more commercial operation. This closed in 1980 as its funding was abused by investors using them as tax avoiding measures. A new development known as the 10BA tax shelter scheme was developed ushering a slew of productions, leading to what Peter Shelley, author of Australian Horror Films, suggested meant \"making a profit was more important than making a good film.\" Shelley called these films derivative of \"American films and presenting generic American material\". These films included the horror film productions of Antony I. Ginnane. While Australia would have success with international films between the mid-1980s and the 2000s, less than five horror films were produced in the country between 1993 and 2000. It was only after the success of Wolf Creek (2005) that a new generation of filmmakers would continuously make horror genre films in Australia that continued into the 2010s.\n\nBy 2005, New Zealand has produced around 190 feature films, with about 88% of them being made after 1976. New Zealand horror film history was described by Philip Matthews of Stuff as making \"po-faced gothic and now we do horror for laughs.\" Among the earliest known New Zealand horror films productions are Strange Behavior (1981), a co-production with Australia and Death Warmed Up (1984) a single production. Early features such as Melanie Read's Trial Run (1984) where a mother is sent to remote cottage to photograph penguins and finds it habitat to haunted spirits, and Gaylene Preston's Mr. Wrong (1984) purchases a car that is haunted by its previous owner. Other films imitate American slasher and splatter films with Bridge to Nowhere (1986), and the early films of Peter Jackson who combined splatter films with comedy with Bad Taste (1988) and Braindead (1992) which has the largest following of the mentioned films. Film producer Ant Timpson had an influence curating New Zealand horror films, creating the Incredibly Strange Film Festival in the 1990s and producing his own horror films over the 2010s including The ABCs of Death (2012), Deathgasm (2015), and Housebound (2014). Timpson noted the latter horror entries from New Zealand are all humorous films like What We Do in the Shadows (2014) with Jonathan King, director of Black Sheep (2006) and The Tattooist (2007) stating \"I'd love to see a genuinely scary New Zealand film but I don't know if New Zealand audiences – or the funding bodies – are keen.\"\n\nAfter the 1931 release of a US-produced Spanish-language version of Dracula by George Melford for the Latin-American market employing Mexican actors, Mexican horror films were produced throughout the 1930s and 1940s, often reflecting on the overarching theme of science vs. religion conflict.[102] Ushered by the release of El vampiro, the Mexploitation horror film era started in 1957, with films characterised by their low production values and camp appeal, often featuring vampires, wrestlers, and Aztec mummies. A key figure in the Mexican horror scene (particularly in Germán Robles-starred vampire films) was producer Abel Salazar.[104] The late 1960s saw the advent of the prominence of Carlos Enrique Taboada as an standout Mexican horror filmmaker, with films such as Hasta el viento tiene miedo (1967), El libro de piedra (1968), Más negro que la noche (1975) or Veneno para las hadas (1984). Mexican horror cinema has been noted for the mashup of classic gothic and romantic themes and characters with autochthonous features of the Mexican culture such as the Ranchería setting, the colonial past or the myth of La Llorona (shared with other Hispanic-American nations).[106]\n\nHorror has proven to be a dependable genre at the Mexican box office in the 21st-century, with Mexico ranking as having the world's largest relative popularity of the genre among viewers (ahead of South Korea), according to a 2016 research.[107]\n\nIn a study done by Uri Hasson et al., brain waves were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This study used the inter-subject correlation analysis (ISC) method of determining results. It was shown that audience members tend to focus on certain facets in a particular scene simultaneously and tend to sit as still as possible while watching horror films.[108]\n\nIn another study done by John Greene & Glenn Sparks, it was found that the audience tends to experience the excitation transfer process (ETP) which causes a physiological arousal in audience members. The ETP refers to the feelings experienced immediately after an emotion-arousing experience, such as watching a horror film. In this case, audience members' heart rate, blood pressure and respiration all increased while watching films with violence. Audience members with positive feedback regarding the horror film have feelings similar to happiness or joy felt with friends, but intensified. Alternatively, audience members with negative feedback regarding the film would typically feel emotions they would normally associate with negative experiences in their life.[citation needed]\n\nOnly about 10% of the American population enjoy the physiological rush felt immediately after watching horror films. The population that does not enjoy horror films could experience emotional fallout similar to that of PTSD if the environment reminds them of particular scenes.[citation needed]\n\nA 2021 study suggested horror films that explore grief can provide psychological benefits to the bereaved, with the genre well suited to representing grief through its genre conventions.[109]\n\nIn a study by Medes et al., prolonged exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noise (<500 Hz) in long durations has an effect on vocal range (i.e. longer exposure tends to form a lower phonation frequency range).[110] Another study by Baliatsas et al. observed that there is a correlation between exposure to infrasound and low-frequency noises and sleep-related problems.[111] Though most horror films keep the audio around 20–30 Hz, the noise can still be unsettling in long durations.[19]\n\nAnother technique used in horror films to provoke a response from the audience is cognitive dissonance, which is when someone experiences tension in themselves and is urged to relieve that tension.[112] Dissonance is the clashing of unpleasant or harsh sounds.[113] A study by Prete et al. identified that the ability to recognize dissonance relied on the left hemisphere of the brain, while consonance relied on the right half.[114] There is a stronger preference for consonance; this difference is noticeable even in early stages of life.[114] Previous musical experience also can influence a dislike for dissonance.[114]\n\nSkin conductance responses (SCRs), heart rate (HR), and electromyographic (EMG) responses vary in response to emotional stimuli, showing higher for negative emotions in what is known as the \"negative bias.\"[115] When applied to dissonant music, HR decreases (as a bodily form of adaptation to harsh stimulation), SCR increases, and EMG responses in the face are higher.[115] The typical reactions go through a two-step process of first orienting to the problem (the slowing of HR), then a defensive process (a stronger increase in SCR and an increase in HR).[115] This initial response can sometimes result in a fight-or-flight response, which is the characteristic of dissonance that horror films rely on to frighten and unsettle viewers.[19]\n\nCritic Robin Wood was not the first film critic to take the horror film seriously, but his article Return of the Repressed in 1978 helped inaugurate the horror film into academic study as a genre. Wood later stated that he was surprised that his work, as well as the writing of Richard Lippe and Andrew Britton would receive \"historic importance\" intellectual views of the film genre. William Paul in his book Laughing Screaming comments that \"the negative definition of the lower works would have it that they are less subtle than higher genres. More positively, it could be said that they are more direct. Where lower forms are explicit, higher forms tend to operate more by indirection. Because of this indirection the higher forms are often regarded as being more metaphorical, and consequently more resonant, more open to the exegetical analyses of the academic industry.\"\n\nSteffen Hantke noted that academic criticism about horror cinema had \"always operated under duress\" noting that challenges in legitimizing its subject, finding \"career-minded academics might have always suspected that they were studying something that was ultimately too frivolous, garish, and sensationalistic to warrant serious critical attention\".\n\nSome commentary has suggested that horror films have been underrepresented or underappreciated as serious works worthy of film criticism and major films awards.[119][120] As of 2021, only six horror films have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, with The Silence of the Lambs being the sole winner.[121][122] However, horror films have still won major awards.[123]\n\nCritics have also commented on the representation of women[124][125][126][127] and disability[128] in horror films, as well as the prevalence of racial stereotypes.[129][130]\n\nMany horror films have been the subject of moral panic, censorship and legal controversy.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, film censorship has frequently been applied to horror films.[131] A moral panic over several slasher films in the 1980s led to many of them being banned but released on videotape; the phenomenon became popularly termed \"video nasties\".[132][133] Constraints on permitted subject matter in Indonesian films has also influenced Indonesian horror films.[134] In March 2008, China banned all horror films from its market.[135]\n\nIn the U.S., the Motion Picture Production Code which was implemented in 1930, set moral guidelines for film content, restraining movies containing controversial themes, graphic violence, explicit sexuality and/or nudity. The gradual abandonment of the Code, and its eventual formal repeal in 1968 (when it was replaced by the MPAA film rating system)[136] offered more freedom to the movie industry.\n• None Aston, James; Walliss, John (2013).

They continue working on characters for another hour and half. DM sits completely silent until they ask questions, but his responses are sort of, catty?\n\n\"So did you get rations?\"\n\n\"Oh uh, not yet. Did I need rations yet?\"\n\n\"Well unless you want to sleep in the dirt and can magically make food appear then I would say yes, you need rations\"\n\nWe all arrive and a circus is ongoing. The DM is using a very fancy large battle map that they are obviously proud of for the first town. Which is cool, don't get me wrong. But it's just too Big. It's hundreds of squares across. The DM is just, idk, too wordy with descriptions\n\n\"So, you all arrive at the town. It appears a circus is ongoing. Before you and throughout are lots of attractions and, um, venues of entertainment with the intent to, um, dazzle and delight the onlookers with spectacular sights to be beholden\"\n\nThis sort of method is used for all Eight attractions. I understand wanting to make a world feel real but it's like someone who thinks more words = better writing.\n\nOn my turn i go to one of the attractions. I tell the dm \"so I'm wanting to find out if the people have noticed anything weird going on or if they've noticed anything\". And as my PC \"well hello there sir, or madam. Have you perchance noticed any ominous going on? Perhaps a bad harvest or maybe strange symbols in the sky?\"\n\nYes, it's a silly way to ask this. I tell dm's what my intent is first and then try to make it somewhat funny by having the character ask it in a far too upfront manner. I get, a glare, from the DM, as his npc asks if I am alright in the head and then starts to lecture me why I would ask about that at a circus? It became clear the dm was wanting us to enjoy the circus events, meet each other randomly, then spring his attack\n\nSo i end my turn saying that since this person has no information I'll ask someone else. It takes a full hour until it is my turn again. Now, here I tried for another joke, so I understand if I am in the wrong here. The idea was we were told information and were selected by \"someone\" for \"something\". I was trying for a \"actually it was my neighbor and I happened to overhear it and so I am hear\". My PC was then accessed of impersonation and identity theft and almost arrested. I can see this as the DM not wanting a silly campaign, however another player was essentially playing he man and kept making he man puns but idk.\n\nThen while I was being arrested the town was attacked by a mobile of small monsters. We had to watch for several minutes as the dm moved all 20 of these minis, counting softly in his head as they traveled on the map. We are about 70 squares from the enemies. Combat begins and the first 3 rounds are just each of us travelling to the fight, which took roughly 40 minutes mostly due to the task of moving 20 minis.\n\nI was just so dead and bored and the game wrapped up shortly after the fight and I don't plan to return. I don't think the DM and it's were on the same wavelength and we both want different games which is fine if they want a different game than me. I was just incredibly bored with all the waiting and felt like absolute walls against my playstyle\n\nSo hopefully me ducking out makes their game more enjoyable for the rest200 Best Horror Movies of All Time: The 200 Best Horror Movies of All Time\n\nNew year, new boo!

It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petersen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman.\n\nIt revolves around a wealthy family whose seemingly perfect life is threatened when their teenage daughter begins dating an attractive and mysterious young man who turns out to be a violent sociopath.\n\nThe film was largely derided by critics upon its release but became a sleeper hit in the spring of 1996, grossing $20 million at the U.S. box office. It has since become a cult film, while at the same time launching teen idol status for its two young leads – Wahlberg and Witherspoon – who were romantically linked at the time of the movie's premiere.[1] Wahlberg was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[2] The film's own producer, Brian Grazer, described it as \"Fatal Attraction for teens\".[3]\n\nSixteen-year-old Nicole Walker lives in the suburbs of Seattle with her father Steven, his new wife Laura, and Laura's son Toby. While she is at a cafe with her best friend Margo Masse and friend Gary Rohmer, Nicole meets David McCall and instantly falls for his good looks and charm.\n\nSteven dislikes David and grows angry with him when he disregards Nicole's curfew and, eventually, has sex with her. David soon becomes possessive and jealous of Nicole, culminating in attacking Gary when he sees them hugging, beating him up, and giving Nicole a black eye. As a result, she breaks up with him, but they get back together when David apologizes to her for his actions. He later manipulates her into believing her father assaulted him.\n\nDavid invites Nicole to a party at his friend Logan's house. At first, she declines but then decides to drive to the party, where she witnesses Margo smoking crack and going off to have sex with David, although Nicole does not realize that she gets sexually assaulted by him.\n\nThe following day, Nicole confronts David about his infidelity and breaks up with him for good. She also confronts Margo, not believing that David sexually assaulted her. He then threatens Margo so she will convince her friend to take him back. After seeing Gary help Nicole into her stepmom's car, David follows and kills him.\n\nNicole goes with Laura and Toby to the mall, where David corners her in the women's restroom, vowing to her that he will not let anyone stand in the way of him having Nicole for himself. Meanwhile, Steven finds his car vandalized with an insulting note left by David.\n\nFurious, Steven breaks into the house David shares with Logan and vandalizes it after discovering a shrine David made for Nicole. In retaliation for the vandalism, David heads to the Walkers' residence with his four friends: Logan, Terry, Knobby, and Hacker, aiming to harm Nicole's family and take Nicole for himself.\n\nAfter Margo informs the Walkers of Gary's death, David and his gang arrive and behead Kaiser, the family dog, then make multiple attempts to break inside. Steven and Laura barricade the doors, and Laura injures Hacker with a drill, leading Knobby to take him him to the hospital. Using a flashlight, Nicole sends an SOS to the Walkers' private security guard Larry, who arrives to confront the situation but is killed by Terry.\n\nDavid, Logan, and Terry take Steven hostage, forcing Laura to surrender. Toby escapes through a window and gets to Laura's car phone. After Terry finds him in the garage, Toby fatally runs him over with the SUV. Logan forces himself onto Nicole; Margo intervenes but is knocked unconscious.\n\nDavid shoots Logan dead for attempting to rape Nicole and then tells her that he intends to kill her father so he can finally have her, believing that Nicole will get over it and accept him. After Toby retrieves Larry's keys and releases his parents, Steven rushes at David. However, David takes him down and gets ready to kill him, until Nicole saves her father by impaling David in the back with a peace pipe (a gift from David himself).\n\nAs a hurt David looks at Nicole in shock, Steven gets back up and brawls with him. An enraged David attempts to attack Nicole, but Steven furiously throws him to his death through the bedroom window. The family embraces as the police and paramedics arrive.\n\nIn March 1994, it was announced that Imagine Entertainment was in the process of putting together a thriller written by Christopher Crowe titled No Fear, with James Foley in negotiations to direct.[4]\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio was looked at for the role of David McCall (surnamed McNeil prior to production), but did not think he was right for the part. Instead, he put in a good word for Mark Wahlberg (with whom he co-starred on The Basketball Diaries) to director James Foley.[5]\n\nReese Witherspoon said she requested a stunt double for the sex scene during the roller coaster sequence, saying:\n\nFear was released on April 12, 1996, in 1,584 theaters. It opened at number four at the box office, making $6.3 million in its opening weekend. By the end of its run, the film earned $20.8 million in the US.[7]\n• \"Something's Always Wrong\" by Toad the Wet Sprocket\n\nFear holds a 46% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 5.20/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Fear has an appealing young cast, but their efforts aren't enough to consistently distract from an increasingly overblown – and illogical – teen stalker story\".[8] On Metacritic it has a score of 51% based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[9] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.[10]\n\nMick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \"Fear is hard to resist. On one hand, it's a shameless thriller that makes up for the inevitability of its story by consistently being bigger, faster, and more appalling than you might expect. On the other hand, it contains enough truth about fathers, teenage daughters, and young lust to distinguish it from most thrillers and ground it in vivid emotion. It is a nightmare fantasy for fathers. Director James Foley and screenwriter Christopher Crowe keep raising the stakes all the way to a finish that's something out of The Straw Dogs. It's a maddening, satisfying, junky, enjoyable picture.\"[11]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive review, further accrediting the comparisons to Fatal Attraction. According to him, \"Fear is a teen Fatal Attraction, with Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon in the Glenn Close and (respectively) Michael Douglas roles, and with William Petersen in Anne Archer's. And – surprise – it isn't bad.\" He did, however, criticize the finale: \"[Director] James Foley does a fine job evoking the sexual tensions between father, daughter, and rogue suitor. Yet he has less luck with the (inevitable) garish climax, which is unconvincingly staged... never even making it over the top\".[12]\n\nGene Siskel gave the film a thumbs-down while Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs-up. Siskel called the picture \"Predictable trash with an 'inspired' title, and with a third act which nosedives into pure mayhem... It's shocking that such a film was made by the same director who gave us At Close Range, Glengary Glen Ross, and After Dark, My Sweet; this one is not worthy of his talent. It should have been titled Who's That Boy.\" Ebert claimed the movie \"generates genuine psychological interest, with an effective and suspenseful portrait of a family under siege.\"[13]\n\nMovie historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture two out of four stars: \"This passable slasher epic benefits from taut, stylish direction and from decent performances; still, it's awfully derivative – especially the climactic showdown. Mark Wahlberg is menacing as the lovestruck hood, but he could benefit from diction lessons.\"[14]\n\nCritical revaluation of the film has proved more positive than its initial reception, with Carter Burwell's score being especially well received.[15] One critic has since stated that \"although dismissed by some reviewers upon its release as a sensationalist, hysterical, formulaic piece, Fear has improved with age\".[16] The film was placed as No. 19 on Bravo TV's \"30 Even Scarier Movie Moments\".[17]\n\nOn May 23, 2019, it was announced that Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment would produce a remake of the film with Brian Grazer again producing, along with Karen Lunder as co-producer. Jonathan Herman was reported to adapt Crowe's script for a modern audience and Amandla Stenberg was in talks to star.[18][19]\n\nIn October 2022, it was reported that a television series adaptation of the film is in development at Peacock.[20]\n• Fear at the AFI Catalog of Feature FilmsFear | Marilynne Robinson: America is a Christian country. This is true in a number of senses. Most people, if asked, will identify themselves as Christian, which may mean only that they aren’t something else. Non-Christians will say America is Christian, meaning that they feel somewhat apart from the majority culture. There are a large number of demographic Christians in North America because of our history of immigration from countries that are or were also Christian. We are identified in the world at large with this religion because some of us espouse it not only publicly but also vociferously. As a consequence, we carry a considerable responsibility for its good name in the world, though we seem not much inclined to consider the implications of this fact. If we did, some of us might think a little longer about associating the precious Lord with ignorance, intolerance, and belligerent nationalism. These few simple precautions would also make it more attractive to the growing numbers among our people who have begun to reject it as ignorant, intolerant, and belligerently nationalistic, as they might reasonably conclude that it is, if they hear only the loudest voices.\n\nThere is something I have felt the need to say, that I have spoken about in various settings, extemporaneously, because my thoughts on the subject have not been entirely formed, and because it is painful to me to have to express them. However, my thesis is always the same, and it is very simply stated, though it has two parts: first, contemporary America is full of fear. And second, fear is not a Christian habit of mind. As children we learn to say, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.” We learn that, after his resurrection, Jesus told his disciples, “Lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.” Christ is a gracious, abiding presence in all reality, and in him history will finally be resolved.\n\nThese are larger, more embracing terms than contemporary Christianity is in the habit of using. But we are taught that Christ “was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made….The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” The present tense here is to be noted. John’s First Letter proclaims “the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us.” We as Christians cannot think of Christ as isolated in space or time if we really do accept the authority of our own texts. Nor can we imagine that this life on earth is our only life, our primary life. As Christians we are to believe that we are to fear not the death of our bodies but the loss of our souls.\n\nWe hear a great deal now about the drift of America away from a Christian identity. Whenever there is talk of decline—as in fact there always is—the one thing that seems to be lacking is a meaningful standard of change. How can we know where we are if we don’t know where we were, in those days when things were as they ought to be? How can we know there has been decline, an invidious qualitative change, if we cannot establish a terminus a quo? I propose attention to the marked and oddly general fearfulness of our culture at present as one way of dealing with the problem. In the twenty-sixth chapter of Leviticus we find a description of the state the people of Israel will find themselves in if they depart from their loyalty to God: “The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues. They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues.”\n\nNow, of course, there are numbers among us who have weapons that would blast that leaf to atoms, and feel brave as they did it, confirmed in their alarm by the fact that there are so very many leaves. But the point is the same. Those who forget God, the single assurance of our safety however that word may be defined, can be recognized in the fact that they make irrational responses to irrational fears. The text specifies the very real threat that fear itself poses—“you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.” There are always real dangers in the world, sufficient to their day. Fearfulness obscures the distinction between real threat on one hand and on the other the terrors that beset those who see threat everywhere. It is clear enough, to an objective viewer at least, with whom one would choose to share a crisis, whose judgment should be trusted when sound judgment is most needed.\n\nGranting the perils of the world, it is potentially a very costly indulgence to fear indiscriminately, and to try to stimulate fear in others, just for the excitement of it, or because to do so channels anxiety or loneliness or prejudice or resentment into an emotion that can seem to those who indulge it like shrewdness or courage or patriotism. But no one seems to have an unkind word to say about fear these days, un-Christian as it surely is.\n\nWe who are students of Calvin’s tradition know that our ancestors in the tradition did not spare their lives or their fortunes. They were loyal to the will of God as they understood it at the most extreme cost to themselves—in worldly terms, that is. They also defended their faith militarily, with intelligence and great courage, but without ultimate success, except in the Low Countries. Therefore the migration of Pilgrims and Puritans, and Huguenots as well, and the great flourishing of Calvinist civilization in the New World. We might say that the oppressors meant it for evil, but God meant it for good, except this might lead us to forget a crucial thing, a factor not present in the story of Joseph and his brothers. Those oppressors were motivated by fear of us. We were heretics by their lights, and therefore a threat to the church, to Christian civilization, to every soul who felt our influence. We filled more or less the same place in the European imagination that Islam does now, one difference being that the Christianity now assumed to be under threat on that most secular continent is merely sociological and cultural, in effect racial, and another difference being that there was no ideal of tolerance and little concept of due process to mitigate the violence the presence of our ancestors inspired. Quite the opposite. To suppress our tradition however viciously was a pious act.\n\nThe terrible massacres of Protestants in France in the sixteenth century, whether official or popular in their origins, reflect the fear that is engendered by the thought that someone really might destroy one’s soul, plunge one into eternal fire by corrupting true belief even inadvertently. If someone had asked a citizen of Lyon, on his way to help exterminate the Calvinists, to explain what he and his friends were doing, he would no doubt have said that he was taking back his city, taking back his culture, taking back his country, fighting for the soul of France. This kind of language was not invented in order to be used against Calvinists—Europe had been purging itself of heretics since the thirteenth century, so the pattern was already well established. These same terms had been used centuries before by the Roman emperor Julian, called the Apostate, when he tried to return Rome from its emerging Christianity to the old classical paganism. But it was applied to our case with notable rigor and persistence, and with great effect.\n\nI spoke not long ago at a homiletics conference in Wittenberg. There were people there from many distant parts of the world, and not a soul from France. I asked why there were no French people there, and was told that Catholics were not as focused on preaching as Protestants. I told them there are in fact Protestants in France. I told them how to find the Église Réformée on the Internet, preaching and music and all. I am aware of them myself because no Christian population anywhere has ever defended its beliefs with more courage against more entrenched persecution than the Protestants of France. These cultural erasures are almost always more apparent than real, and still they matter, because they assert the unique legitimacy of one descriptor, narrowly defined—Roman, or French, or Aryan, or Catholic, or Christian, or American.\n\nIt is difficult for any number of reasons to define a religion, to establish an essence and a circumference, and this is true not least because it always has its supernumeraries, often legions of them. I saw a cinema spectacular when I was growing up, Demetrius and the Gladiators, directed by Delmer Daves. Demetrius, who bore an uncanny resemblance to Victor Mature, was a Christian convert, obliged therefore to turn the other cheek when taunted by a bully. A gladiator acquaintance of his, an enormous Nubian man, walloped the bully with a plated forearm, sending him sprawling, then growled after him, exultingly, “I am no Christian!” Needless to say, the theater audience erupted in cheers. There was popcorn all over the place. (Parenthetically: I watched this film and The Robe, directed by Henry Koster, to see if I had been fair to Koster and Daves, and I had not. Both represent the Christian community as gentle and serene, startlingly so by our standards. But then, in those early days Christians had only such emperors as Caligula to worry about.)\n\nCalvin had his supernumeraries, great French lords who were more than ready to take up arms in his cause, which was under severe persecution. He managed to restrain them while he lived, saying that the first drop of blood they shed would become a torrent that drowned France. And, after he died, Europe was indeed drenched in blood. So there is every reason to suppose that Calvin would have thought his movement had lost at least as much as it gained in these efforts to defend it, as he anticipated it would. Specifically, in some degree it lost its Christian character, as Christianity, or any branch of it, always does when its self-proclaimed supporters outnumber and outshout its actual adherents. What is true when there is warfare is just as true when the bonding around religious identity is militantly cultural or political.\n\nAt the core of all this is fear, real or pretended. What if these dissenters in our midst really are a threat to all we hold dear? Better to deal with the problem before their evil schemes are irreversible, before our country has lost its soul and the United Nations has invaded Texas. We might step back and say that there are hundreds of millions of people who love this nation’s soul, who in fact are its soul, and patriotism should begin by acknowledging this fact. But there is not much fear to be enjoyed from this view of things. Why stockpile ammunition if the people over the horizon are no threat? If they would in fact grieve with your sorrows and help you through your troubles?\n\nAt a lunch recently Lord Jonathan Sacks, then chief rabbi of the United Kingdom, said that the United States is the world’s only covenant nation, that the phrase “We the People” has no equivalent in the political language of other nations, and that the State of the Union Address should be called the renewal of the covenant. I have read that Americans are now buying Kalashnikovs in numbers sufficient to help subsidize Russian rearmament, to help their manufacturers achieve economies of scale. In the old days these famous weapons were made with the thought that they would be used in a land war between great powers, that is, that they would kill Americans. Now, since they are being brought into this country, the odds are great that they will indeed kill Americans. But only those scary ones who want to destroy all we hold dear. Or, more likely, assorted adolescents in a classroom or a movie theater.\n\nI know there are any number of people who collect guns as sculpture, marvels of engineering. When we mount a cross on a wall, we don’t do it with the thought that, in a pinch, we might crucify someone. This seems to be a little different when the icon in question is a gun. A “civilian” Kalashnikov can easily be modified into a weapon that would blast a deer to smithereens. That’s illegal, of course, and unsportsmanlike. I have heard the asymmetry rationalized thus: deer can’t shoot back. Neither can adolescents in a movie theater, of course. Neither can anyone not prepared for mayhem to break loose anywhere, at any time. And, imagining an extremely improbable best case, it is very hard to threaten or deter someone who is suicidal, as most of these assailants are. Gun sales stimulate gun sales—a splendid business model, no doubt about that. Fear operates as an appetite or an addiction. You can never be safe enough.\n\nI know that hunting is sacrosanct in this country. This is beside the point, since hunting rifles are not the problem. And the conversation around this issue never stays long with hunting. It goes instead to the Second Amendment. Any literalist reading would notice the founders’ words “well-regulated” on one hand, and on the other the alarm that arises among the pro-gun people at the slightest mention of anything that resembles regulation, and their constant efforts to erode what little regulation there is. The supposed neglect or abuse of this revered document, and the supposed “defense of the Second Amendment,” is leveraged on that other fear, the fear that those bland blue helmets might be gathering even now, maybe in Canada, to commence their internationalist march into the heart of Texas. Will we wake to find ourselves betrayed by our own government!! Maybe nothing has deterred them to this point but those Kalashnikovs. How fortunate that the factory in Russia is up and running. And how hard those Russians must be laughing, all the way to the bank. And all those homicidal insurgents and oppressors in the turbulent parts of the world, how pleased they must be that we cheapen these marvelous weapons for them. Oh, I know there are all sorts of reliable gun manufacturers, in Austria, for example. Our appetite for weapons is one of those vacuums nature hates, that is to say, fills.\n\nThe Second Amendment argument is brilliant in its way, because the Constitution is central to everything American. The president takes an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution—nothing more, nothing other. I took a rather similar oath myself once, when I accepted a generous fellowship of a kind established under President Eisenhower and continued under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. But of course J. Edgar Hoover identified Dwight Eisenhower as a Communist sympathizer. I guess he would cite me as proof, since I did indeed study Shakespeare with the sponsorship of the federal government, on a National Defense Education Act fellowship. I flatter myself that we are no worse for it.\n\nThe government at that time felt that humanists also contributed to the well-being of the United States. How times change. I have in fact a number of credentials that would make me a driven leaf, as things are reckoned now. I have lived in Massachusetts and other foreign countries. My command of French is not absolutely minimal. I have degrees from elite institutions. I am a professor in a secular university. All in all I am a pretty good example of the sort who inspire fight-or-flight responses in certain segments of the population. I find myself musing over this from time to time.\n\nBe that as it may. Our first loyalty in this country is to the Constitution, so if the case can be made that any part of the Bill of Rights, for heaven’s sake, is under threat, then the whole edifice is imperiled. And what is a patriot to do in the face of such peril? Carry, as they say, just to assert the right. In the old movies a concealed weapon was the unfailing mark of a coward, but Clint Eastwood came along to rescue us from our scruples about such things. And besides, a visible weapon would not only spoil the lines of a business suit, it would also alarm and no doubt alienate anyone who watches the news.\n\nBy pure coincidence, as I was writing these thoughts, sitting on my back porch in my quiet, crime-free neighborhood, I heard one man loudly lecturing another on the inappropriateness of going armed into a grocery store, telling him that if he did he could expect the manager to call the police, and that when the police ordered him to leave he was indeed obliged to leave. Do I feel safer in my neighborhood because this unknown man is wandering around with a gun, licensed though it seems to be? No I don’t. Since everything is economics these days, what would it cost a store in terms of trade if word got out that he frequented it, with his loyalty to the Second Amendment on display? Or possibly concealed? I’m betting he could put them out of business, because when people see weapons, they have every reason on earth to fear the worst. And what does it cost to police this sort of thing, in this time of budget cuts? If there is any argument for weapons from a public safety point of view, there is a much stronger argument for sparing the police the problem of dealing with such distractions, and for minimizing the risk of their killing or being killed by someone they must assume to be armed.\n\nSo, concealed carry. The gun lobby has made its product socially acceptable by putting it out of sight, issues of cowardice notwithstanding.\n\nThe next thing to do is to stockpile weapons. Buy gold from that man on , maybe some of that dried food, too. Prowl around in the woods with people who share your views. Some pretty intense bonding goes on, swapping fears around a campfire, as any girl scout can testify. And keep an eye out for traitors, active or passive, intentional or not. Who can say, after all, that the Christians did not turn the gods against Rome, that the Cathars did not kill souls, that witches did not cast spells, that Jews did not poison wells, that Gypsies did not steal infants, that a Republican president did not send English majors to graduate school as part of a scheme to soften the national resolve? It is notoriously impossible to prove a negative. I think the army of the United Nations is invoked in these cases as a small and rare concession to standards of plausibility. No one would imagine such a thing of the United States Army. Other plausibility issues arise, of course. To the best of my knowledge, the forces of the United Nations exist primarily to be ineffectual in hopeless situations. Never mind. They are an ominous threat. We might need to shoot at them.\n\nThis is the point at which that supernumerary phenomenon I mentioned becomes a factor. There is a First Amendment, too, and it is directed toward, among other things, forbidding an establishment of religion. Yet among the self-declared Constitutionalists the word “Christian” has become the kind of test for electoral eligibility that the founders specifically meant to forbid. Is Mitt Romney a Christian? Mormonism has a pretty exotic theology, after all. Is Barack Obama a Christian? He adopted Christianity as an adult, true, having been unaffiliated with institutional religion until then, but the whole history of the Spanish Inquisition proves how hard some people find it to trust a convert. There was a time when we Calvinists felt the force of the terror and antagonism that can be raised against those who are not Christian in a sense other people are willing to accept. This doleful trait is being played upon in our current politics. Supernumeraries who strike out against the free exercise of religion might say, “I am no Christian.” With equal truth they might also say, “I am no American.” And a pretty large part of the crowd would probably cheer.\n\nI defer to no one in my love for America and for Christianity. I have devoted my life to the study of both of them. I have tried to live up to my association with them. And I take very seriously Jesus’s teachings, in this case his saying that those who live by the sword will also die by the sword. Something called Christianity has become entangled in exactly the strain of nationalism that is militaristic, ready to spend away the lives of our young, and that can only understand dissent from its views as a threat or a defection, a heresy in the most alienating and stigmatizing sense of the word. We are not the first country where this has happened. The fact that it was the usual thing in Europe, and had been for many centuries, was one great reason for attempting to separate church and state here.\n\nJesus’s aphorism may be taken to mean simply that those who deal in violence are especially liable to suffer violence. True enough. But death is no simple thing when Jesus speaks of it. His thoughts are not our thoughts, the limits of our perceptions are not limits he shares. We must imagine him seeing the whole of our existence, our being beyond mortality, beyond time. There is that other death he can foresee, the one that really matters. When Christians abandon Christian standards of behavior in the defense of Christianity, when Americans abandon American standards of conduct in the name of America, they inflict harm that would not be in the power of any enemy. As Christians they risk the kind of harm to themselves to which the Bible applies adjectives like “everlasting.”\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is more imperiled in these moments than in any others, and so is organized religion. Try to persuade a skeptic of the value of religion, and he or she will mention some horror of European history carried out under the sign of the cross. They are innumerable. I have mentioned St. Bartholomew’s Day. One hears of the secularization of Europe, often in the context of socialist economics, rarely in the context of a frankly terrifying history. We must be very careful not to defeat the safeguards our laws and traditions have put in place. Christian “establishment,” the making of Christianity in effect the official religion, is the first thing its supernumeraries would try for, and the last thing its faithful should condone.\n\nAs for America, we have a way of plunging into wars we weary of and abandon after a few years and a few thousand casualties, having forgotten what our object was; these wars demonstrate an overwhelming power to destroy without any comparable regard to life and liberty, to the responsibilities of power, that would be consistent with maintaining our good name. We throw away our status in the world at the urging of those who think it has nothing to do with our laws and institutions, impressed by the zeal of those supernumeraries who are convinced that it all comes down to shock and awe and boots on the ground. This notion of glory explains, I suppose, some part of the fantasizing, the make-believe wars against make-believe enemies, and a great many of the very real Kalashnikovs.Definition of FEAR: He was trembling with fear.\n\nunable to walk the streets without fear of being mugged\n\nThey regarded their enemies with fear and hatred.\n\nI've been trying to overcome my fear of flying.\n\nThe government is trying to allay fears of a recession.\n\nEmployees expressed fears that the company would go out of business.\n\nHe told us about all his hopes and fears.\n\nShe has a morbid fear of cats.\n\nHe was a cruel king who was feared and hated by his subjects.\n\nThere's no need to fear."}

Chávez recalled that the presidential palace's guards stopped and questioned him. They reportedly asked him: \"[l]ook here, major, is it true about the Bolivarian Movement? We'd like to hear more about it; we're not prepared to go on killing people\". Chávez took this as a sign that his plan to overthrow the government was gaining momentum. By late 1989, the first civilians joined the EBR-200's ranks. The EBR-200 thus changed its name to the Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario-200 (MBR-200—the \"Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200\"). The supplanting of the word \"Army\" (Ejército) with \"Movement\" (Movimiento) was intended to punctuate this shift. However, on 6 December 1989, Chávez along with other senior officers were abruptly arrested. They were brought before army command on charges of plotting a coup that was suspected by the government as planned for Christmas Day. They were accused of planning the assassination of high government officials, including President Pérez. Yet the officers were eventually released—due to lack of evidence. The government was reluctant to prosecute officers who were recognized in the military as among the best in their respective armed services. Nevertheless, all—including Chávez—were thereafter sent to posts far from the federal government in Caracas. Chávez was sent in 1990 to Maturín, where he was appointed the official in charge of civilian matters with the Ranger Brigade headquartered in the area. Chávez was later allowed to matriculate at the Universidad Simón Bolívar (\"Simón Bolívar University\") in Caracas, where he did graduate work in political science. He left without a degree. Chávez took courses until August 1991.\n\nChávez re-entered military service with an initial re-posting to Cumaná, where a desk job awaited him. Chávez recalled feeling that such a seemingly dull and minor posting was beneath him. Thereafter, from 1991 to 4 February 1992, Chávez was again given his own command—the Maracay-based Colonel Antonio Nicolas Briceño 421st Airborne Battalion, 42nd Airborne Brigade, of the Venezuelan Army's 4th Armored Division (then the 4th Infantry Division). Such troops proved key in facilitating Chávez's various political ambitions. Chávez received the job when the battalion's former commander retired from the army; Chávez was his replacement as commanding officer. With a posting in Maracay, a city that is relatively near the national power structures in Caracas, Chávez's coup plans were no longer hindered by his own geographic isolation. Later, reports emerged of a dossier detailing all of Chávez's subversive activities. It had been produced just prior to Chávez's new Maracay posting—yet, the document was ignored by military intelligence. The major who had compiled it was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.\n\nBy 1991, Chávez and other MBR-200 leaders activated the coup plan codenamed after one of Chávez's heroes, Ezequiel Zamora—Plan Zamora. Yet despite planning for the coup's execution, Chávez and other MBR-200 leaders made precious little plans about what their putative future rebel government would do after the rebellion. Their future governing structure thus remained vague until the end of 1991, when Chávez and others decided to delineate an initial legal framework for their government's operation. Several assorted coup dates were proposed by Chávez's associates. Indeed, many junior captains threatened to launch their own early coup, which would be independent of that waged by their higher ranked commanders. They threatened this action if Chávez refused to pick a date that they considered soon enough. Yet Chávez refused to budge on a December 1991 attempt. He stated that nothing was to be attempted without his involvement. The captains thus waited for Chávez's chosen date. Yet one aspect of the planned coup remained clear throughout: Chávez's demand that it maintain a primarily military focus and character. The leftist ex-guerrilla leader Douglas Bravo—who fought in the 1960s and 1970s—also regularly met Chávez. These meetings took place during the years leading up to the coup and without the knowledge of other key MBR-200 officers. Bravo recounted that Chávez did not trust civilians enough to afford them a role in his bloody intrigue. According to him, it was for this reason that what was initially planned as a civilian-military rebellion was pared down by Chávez to one fought solely by soldiers; Bravo and his leftist civilian cohorts were turfed out of logistical considerations, preparations, and planning just days before the coup.\n\nYet, towards the end of January 1992, Chávez realized that the Movement's window of opportunity was to close. Chávez received notification that he faced imminent transferral on 14 February—to a small village on the frontier with war-ravaged Colombia. Chávez realized that this posting would jeopardize his participation in the MBR-200 coup, as the town was far from the major cities and power centers of Venezuela's northern coastal strip. Alarmed at this prospect, Chávez and other Movement members held one final meeting. There, they determined to act before Chávez's transfer. They would quicken preparations and wait until President Pérez—who was just then abroad on a trip to the 1992 World Economic Forum , held in Switzerland—returned to Venezuela. All the while, MBR-200 rebel forces built up their numbers. Eventually, 5 lieutenant colonels, 14 majors, 54 captains, 67 first and second lieutenants, 65 warrant officers and technical non-commissioned personnel, 101 sergeants and senior non-commissioned officers and 2,056 corporals and enlisted servicemen were involved in the conspiracy; thus Chávez and other rebel commanders had 2,367 military personnel from 10 army battalions to rely upon. They set a final date for their coup: Tuesday, 4 February 1992.Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario - 200 - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: El Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200 o MBR-200 fue un movimiento revolucionario cívico-militar de izquierda, fundado por el teniente coronel Hugo Chávez en 1982 como evolución del EBR-200 (Ejército Bolivariano Revolucionario).[1]​\n\nEste movimiento fue influenciado por la izquierda venezolana y los siguientes partidos: Partido Comunista de Venezuela, Partido de la Revolución Venezolana, MIR de Venezuela, Partido Bandera Roja, entre otros, al cual también se unieron otros grupos dentro de la fuerza armada como la Alianza Revolucionaria de Militares Activos (ARMA), perteneciente a la Aviación Militar Bolivariana.\n\nLa visibilidad del MBR-200 aumentó significativamente después del intento de golpe de Estado el 4 de febrero de 1992 contra el presidente Carlos Andrés Pérez. Aunque este golpe no tuvo éxito, puso al MBR-200 y a Hugo Chávez en el centro de atención pública. Chávez, encarcelado después del intento de golpe, fue liberado dos años después, y aunque decidió disolver formalmente el MBR-200, el movimiento sirvió como base para la creación de un nuevo partido político: el Movimiento V República (MVR), que llevaría a Chávez a la presidencia en 1998.[2]​\n\nDespués del Golpe de Estado de 1958 los partidos Acción Democrática, Copei y el URD suscribieron el llamado Pacto de Puntofijo un acuerdo de gobernabilidad donde las partes acordaron reconocer el resultado de las elecciones presidenciales de 1958, todo con el fin de evitar el sectarismo del Trienio Adeco. El Partido Comunista de Venezuela fue excluido del pacto por divergencias ideológicas, posteriormente se alza el armas fundando las FALN y participando en El Carupanazo y El Porteñazo, por lo cual el partido fue ilegalizado.\n\nEn 1959 Fidel Castro salió victorioso en la Sierra Maestra y tomó el poder en Cuba, tras lo cual visitó Venezuela, fue a la Universidad Central de Venezuela e hizo un discurso incendiario, ganando la admiración de miles de jóvenes Venezolanos. Posteriormente, se reunió con el presidente Rómulo Betancourt con el propósito de solicitar apoyo económico, el cual le fue negado.\n\nCastro ganó muchos colaboradores venezolanos y mantuvo reuniones con líderes comunistas como Gustavo Machado, Fabricio Ojeda, Douglas Bravo, Alí Rodríguez Araque (siendo este el colaborador más cercano de Castro en Venezuela), Pompeyo Márquez, Américo Martín, Teodoro Petkoff entre otros, para organizar el comienzo de la lucha armada con grupos guerrilleros como las FALN, para tomar el poder en Venezuela.\n\nLas Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN) fueron la organización guerrillera creada por el Partido Comunista de Venezuela (PCV) en 1962 para dar origen a los nacientes grupos rebeldes que empezaban a operar en el país con el fin de derrocar al gobierno de Rómulo Betancourt. Según el exoficial de la inteligencia cubana Ulises Estrada, la creación de las FALN se enmarcó en una política de apoyo de Fidel Castro a los movimientos armados de Latinoamérica. El máximo líder de estos grupos en Venezuela fue Douglas Bravo. Financiado por Castro, rápidamente crean numerosos focos en toda Venezuela.\n\nA estas organizaciones armadas se les responsabilizó, en 1962, por estar vinculadas con dos levantamientos armados en las fuerzas armadas venezolanas. El primero, El Carupanazo, fue una insurrección militar de izquierda ocurrida en Carúpano; estalló en la medianoche del 4 de mayo de 1962. El segundo, El Porteñazo, fue una sublevación de la base naval Agustín Armario contra el gobierno del presidente Rómulo Betancourt ocurrida entre el 2 y 3 de junio de 1962. Fidel Castro, al notar el fracaso armado en Venezuela, rompió relaciones con Bravo e inmediatamente cortó el apoyo económico.\n\nEl proyecto de la Revolución bolivariana, surgió en 1964, cuando Douglas Bravo propuso, mediante un informe sobre la situación político-militar ante la 5ta Conferencia del Partido Comunista de Venezuela, el bolivarianismo revolucionario. En 1965, fue expulsado del Partido Comunista de Venezuela. Bravo le ofreció al periodista mexicano Mario Menéndez, de la revista Sucesos, una entrevista donde reivindicaba el 'marxismo-leninismo-bolivariano'.\n\nEn 1966 se fundó el Partido de la Revolución Venezolana (PRV), cuyo nombre fue propuesto por Fabricio Ojeda. Este adoptó las tesis del Partido Comunista de Venezuela de 1967 sobre la necesidad de impulsar una alianza cívico-militar para hacer realidad la revolución, pero se separaba cada vez más del pensamiento marxista-leninista clásico, apuntando hacia el nacionalismo venezolano. El ideario se llamó «las Tres Raíces»: Simón Bolívar, Simón Rodríguez y Ezequiel Zamora.[3]​\n\nDouglas Bravo concluye que una Revolución no la podría lograr con las Fuerzas Armadas en contra; así que cambió su estrategia de lucha armada para pasar a infiltrar cadetes en la Academia Militar de Venezuela. Él y sus colaboradores reclutaron jóvenes de toda Venezuela con el fin de convertirlos en futuros oficiales y suboficiales de carrera para tomar el poder en Venezuela, apoyando la revolución promovida por él.\n\nFidel Castro coloca junto a Douglas Bravo su hombre de mayor confianza en Venezuela, Alí Rodríguez Araque, quien lo mantenía informado de todos los movimientos revolucionarios en este país. Fidel estaba al tanto de todos los movimientos de Bravo y de sus estrategias de infiltración de las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela. Bravo tenía contactos dentro de la academia militar para llevar a cabo esta tarea, como el mayor William Izarra.\n\nAdán Chávez fue parte del Partido de la Revolución Venezolana y su hermano, el capitán Hugo Chávez, director de Educación Física de la Escuela Militar, fue presentado a la dirigencia del PRV. Douglas Bravo se contactó entre finales de la década de 1970 y principios de la década de 1990 con Chávez y Francisco Arias Cárdenas, principalmente.[3]​\n\nEn diciembre de 1982 Chávez efectuó el juramento del Samán de Güere.[3]​\n\nLos primeros integrantes del movimiento fueron Hugo Chávez y sus compañeros militares Raúl Isaías Baduel, Felipe Acosta Carlez y Jesús Urdaneta.[4]​ El movimiento comenzó \"más como un círculo de estudios políticos que como una conspiración subversiva\", pero pronto sus miembros \"comenzaron a pensar en términos de algún tipo de golpe de Estado\". Chávez y sus compañeros pronto reclutaron más miembros, incluido Francisco Arias Cárdenas, en marzo de 1985.[5]​\n\nFrancisco Arias Cárdenas declaró: «Es cierto que los conceptos esenciales de referencia histórica que nosotros adoptamos venían del PRV. Eso es innegable. Ya los había leído en las revistas de Ruptura y las compartía. Estas ideas fundamentales las asumíamos como nuestras, pero la elaboración inicial fue de Douglas y de su equipo de análisis: Argelia Melet, el Flaco Prada y la gente que estaba con ellos en las discusiones».[3]​\n\nEl exmiembro del Buró Político del PRV y exfundador del Movimiento Político Ruptura Kléber Ramírez Rojas declaró: «Hacia mediados de noviembre de 1991 en una reunión presidida por el comandante Chávez (...) se decidió crear una comisión redactora de los documentos fundamentales para la instalación de nuevo gobierno. Esa comisión me fue encomendada presidirla por lo que trabajé intensamente en ello».[3]​\n\nSegún Pablo Medina, el 1 de enero de 1992 se reunió con Chávez, Arias y Kléber para discutir la conformación de la Junta de Gobierno, integrada por cinco civiles y cuatro militares, entre otros, José Vicente Rangel, Abdón Vivas Terán, Andrés Velásquez, Luis Miquilena y Manuel Quijada.[3]​\n\nDurante el segundo gobierno de Rafael Caldera fueron sobreseídos y salen en libertad todos los militares responsables del Primer y Segundo intento de golpe de Estado de Venezuela de 1992, dándoles oportunidad política en Venezuela. El declive de los partidos tradicionales y el movimiento populista iniciado por Caldera, dieron oportunidad a Hugo Chávez para iniciar su propio movimiento político, el cual se cristalizó al consolidar y Movimiento V República (MVR) proveniente del Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario - 200 (MBR-200), que logró una clara victoria en las elecciones presidenciales de 1998.\n\nEn 2001, Chávez denunció la burocratización del Movimiento V República bajo Luis Miquilena y propuso el relanzamiento del MBR-200 original. Esto eventualmente conduciría a la consolidación de su movimiento bajo la etiqueta del Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela en 2007.\n\nEl legado del MBR-200 reside en su papel catalizador para el cambio político en Venezuela. Abogó por un giro hacia una forma socialista de gobierno y sentó las bases ideológicas para la posterior \"Revolución Bolivariana\" liderada por Chávez. Aunque su existencia activa fue relativamente corta, su influencia en la política venezolana ha sido duradera, dando forma a las décadas de política que seguirían.[2]​\n• Primer intento de golpe de Estado de Venezuela de 1992\n• Segundo intento de golpe de Estado de Venezuela de 1992\n• Ángela Zago, La rebelión de los ángeles, 3.ª ed. noviembre de 1998.Movement of the Fifth Republic (MVR) | Britannica: Movement of the Fifth Republic (MVR), nationalist Venezuelan political party established to support the presidential candidacy of Hugo Chávez in 1998.\n\nMBR-200 was secretly established within the Venezuelan military in the 1980s by Chávez and his fellow military officers. The movement rejected democracy, endorsed policies based on Chávez’s interpretation of the philosophy of Simón Bolívar (who led the revolutions of independence against Spain in South America in the 19th century), and sometimes advocated violence to overthrow the existing political order.\n\nIn 1992 the Bolivarian Movement 200, led by Chávez, who was then a lieutenant colonel, attempted to engineer a coup, justifying its intervention on the basis of charges of governmental corruption and various economic grievances. Chávez was subsequently imprisoned, but he won sympathy from large segments of the Venezuelan population. In 1994 Chávez was released from prison in a goodwill gesture by Venezuela’s newly elected president, Rafael Caldera Rodríguez.\n\nAlthough the movement had previously called on its supporters to abstain from voting, in 1998 Chávez established the MVR to serve as a vehicle for his successful bid for the presidency. The MVR’s criticisms of social inequalities won it broad support among the country’s impoverished. In the 1998 legislative elections, the party became the second largest in the National Assembly. In 2002 opponents of Chávez engineered his brief ouster from the presidency, but protests and threats of violence from his supporters resulted in his return to power less than three days later. In the 2005 legislative elections, Chávez’s MVR won the majority of seats in the National Assembly (and other pro-Chávez parties gained the remainder) after several opposition parties boycotted the elections to protest what they saw as corruption in the Chávez-dominated National Election Council, the institution that oversees elections.\n\nThe MVR was dissolved in 2007 to become part of Chávez’s new political party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela; PSUV), which was created by a merger of some of his coalition partners.

The KCK is in charge of a number of decisions, and often releases press statements on behalf of its members.\n\nThe PJAK also has sub-divisions:[22]\n• Armed wing – Eastern Kurdistan Units (Kurdish: Yekîneyên Rojhilatê Kurdistan, YRK), formerly known as the Eastern Kurdistan Forces (Kurdish: Hêzên Rojhilatê Kurdistan, HRK) 23\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the PJAK and PKK \"appear to a large extent to be one and the same, and share the same goal: fighting campaigns to win new autonomy and rights for Kurds. The only difference is that the PJAK fights in Iran, and PKK fights in Turkey. They share leadership, logistics and allegiance to Abdullah Ocalan, the PKK leader currently imprisoned in Turkey.\"[25] About half of its militants are women.[19]\n\nThe PJAK leadership claims that the group's goals are principally focused on replacing Iran's theocracy with a federal and democratic government which accepts an autonomy for ethnic minorities in Iran.[19]\n\nPjak has undergone several divisions so far. The first split took place in Pjak in 2005, and members of the split, such as (Osman Jafari, Shiva Kargar, Habib Tahmasabi, Yusuf Hatami and....,) founded the Democratic Union of Kurdistan.\n\nThe Kurdistan Free Life Party, has been engaged in an armed conflict with the Iranian authorities since 2004.\n\nIstanbul's Cihan News Agency claimed that over 120 members of the Iranian security forces were killed by PJAK during 2005.[27]\n\nPJAK killed 24 members of Iranian security forces on 3 April 2006, in retaliation for the killing of 10 Kurds demonstrating in Maku by Iranian security forces.[20] On 10 April 2006, seven PJAK members were arrested in Iran, on suspicion that they had killed three Iranian security force personnel. PJAK set off a bomb on 8 May 2006 in Kermanshah, wounding five people at a government building.[28]\n\nAs early as mid-2006, the Iranian security forces have confronted PJAK guerrillas in many occasions along the border inside Iran. Since then, the United States news channel MSNBC claims that the Iranian military has begun bombardments of Kurdish villages in Iraq along the Iranian border while claiming that their primary targets have been PJAK militants. A number of civilians have died.[29] PJAK claims its guerrillas fight inside Iran, and in August 2007, managed to destroy an Iranian military helicopter that was conducting a forward operation of bombardment by Iranian forces.[30]\n\nOn 24 April 2009, PJAK rebels attacked a police station in Kermanshah province. According to Iranian government sources, 18 policemen and 8 rebels were killed in a fierce gun battle.[31] Iran responded a week later by attacking Kurdish villages in the border area of Panjwin inside Iraq using helicopter gunships. According to Iraqi border guards officials, the area attacked by Iran was not considered a stronghold of PJAK, that appeared to have been the target of the raid. According to the ICRC, more than 800 Iraqi Kurds have been forced from their homes by the recent cross-border violence.[32]\n\nOn 16 July 2011, the Iranian army launched a major offensive against PJAK compounds in the mountainous regions of northern Iraq. According to the Revolutionary Guards dozens of rebels have been killed.[7][33] According to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on 26 July, PJAK militants were killed in clashes in several towns in West Azerbaijan province. Kurdish media reported that at least five Revolutionary Guards were killed.[34]\n\nPJAK spokesperson Sherzad Kemankar announced in an interview with the Iraqi Kurdish newspapers Hawlati and Awene that the Iranian forces attacked PJAK strongholds on July 16, however PJAK succeeded in pushing back the Iranian military to their original positions and 53 Iranian soldiers were killed in the battle while PJAK lost two fighters. Sherzad Kemankar also pointed out that Iranian forces were carrying out a joint operation with Ansar al-Islam using heavy weaponry.[35] Iranian media later reported that General Abbas Asemi, one of the most senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commanders in the holy city of Qom along with at least 5 other Revolutionary Guard soldiers were killed in clashes with Kurdish rebels near the Iraq border.[36]\n\nThe Iranian government blames the PJAK for sabotage attacks on gas pipelines and ambushing its troops, according to Reuters, aid agencies say shelling by the Revolutionary Guard has \"killed some civilians and forced hundreds to flee their homes\" in the area. The Revolutionary Guard denies the charge.[7]\n\nOn 8 August 2011, during a lull for Ramadan in the IRGC offensive, PJAK leader Haji Ahmadi, told an interviewer his group is prepared to negotiate with Iran and maintained that Kurdish issues need to be solved through \"peaceful means\". Haji Ahmadi acknowledged that in some cases compromise is inevitable and indicated that PJAK is willing to lay down its arms. He said fighting may not help Kurds secure political and cultural rights in Iran.[37] However, the Guards resumed their offensive on September 2 and rejected any ceasefire call by PJAK, saying the Kurdish rebels have no choice but to lay down arms or leave the border areas. On 19 September, Iran's ground forces commander, Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Pourdastan, told the Vatan-e-Emrooz newspaper his forces would finish off armed Kurdish Iraqi-based rebels in the \"coming days\".[38]\n\nThe rejection of ceasefire offer by PJAK led to new skirmishes between the two sides. On 2 September, after a one-month lull in fighting, IRGC began a new round of ground operations against PJAK. On 9 September 2011, Iranian media reported that Brigadier General Abbas Ali Jannesari of the IRGC was killed during a battle with PJAK rebels.[39]\n\nOn 30 September 2011, Deputy Commander of the Ground Forces of Iran's IRGC, Brigadier General Abdullah Araqi announced that after the Iranian military captured the Jasosan heights, the PJAK conceded defeat and agreed to retreat one kilometer away from the Iranian border and to refrain from military activities on Iran's soil and recruitment of Iranian nationals.[40] According to Iranian media, 180 PJAK militias were killed and 300 wounded during the last operations seizing PJAK's headquarters in Jasosan heights in the Northwestern border regions of Iran.[41]\n\nOn 25 April 2012, Iranian media reported that four members of elite Revolutionary Guards were killed and four others were wounded during an attack by PJAK rebels near Paveh in Kermanshah province in western Iran.[42]\n\nIn 2011, PJAK leader Rahman Haj Ahmadi, in an interview with the conservative activist Kenneth R. Timmerman, claimed that elements in the units of the Turkish military or Turkish government had deliberately aligned with Iranian forces to suppress the secular PJAK in Iran.[citation needed]\n\nThe following countries have listed PJAK as a terrorist organization.\n\nBoth the United States and PJAK have always denied any form of ties. Since February 2009, the PJAK is classified as a terrorist organization by the US government, freezing any assets the PJAK has under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibiting American citizens from doing business with the organization. Officials have cited PJAK's connections to the PKK as the basis for this designation[43]—the US has proscribed the PKK as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" since 1997 in support of Turkey, a regional ally of the US and fellow NATO member.[2] Iranian media and government figures have frequently charged that PJAK is covertly supported by the United States and its allies in order to undermine Iranian \"state power\". Iranian officials have also claimed that PJAK attacks come \"with the support of America and the Zionist regime\" (Israel).[7]\n\nOn April 18, 2006, Congressman Dennis Kucinich sent a letter to President George W. Bush in which he expressed his judgment that the U.S. is likely to be supporting and coordinating PJAK, since PJAK operates and is based in Iraqi territory, which is under the control of the U.S. supported Kurdistan Regional Government.[44]\n\nFrom November 2006 to June 2008, journalist Seymour Hersh maintained that the Bush administration was gearing up for war with Iran, and in November 2006 he wrote in The New Yorker that the US military and Israel are giving PJAK equipment, training, and targeting information in order to create internal pressures in Iran. An Israeli spokesperson immediately denied the claims.[45] Likewise, Ross Wilson, the US ambassador to Turkey at the time, quickly issued an official denial of any kind of American assistance to PJAK in an effort to quell the uproar in Turkey.[46] Wilson also sent a classified cable to Washington in December 2007 (which was later leaked) in which he strongly urged the US government to officially blacklist PJAK.[47]\n\nIn the wake of this incident, high-ranking PKK commander Cemil Bayık asserted in an interview with Agence France-Presse that while US officials had made contact with PJAK, America had provided no support whatsoever to the insurgent group. Maintaining that the PKK was the founder and only real supporter of PJAK, Bayık further stated that \"if the US is interested in PJAK, then it has to be interested in the PKK as well\", which would contradict the established hostility of the US toward the PKK.[46]\n\nIn 2007, the Washington Times claimed that Haji Ahmadi, the leader of PJAK, visited Washington, DC in August 2007 in order to seek political and military backing from the US,[48] but only made limited contact with officials and failed to obtain any such support.[29] However, in a statement released on 18 October 2008, PJAK accused the US of having passed intelligence to Turkish and Iranian forces as they conducted intensified bombing campaigns and cross-border attacks against PJAK and PKK bases in the Qandil region.[49]\n\nOn 4 February 2009, United States Department of the Treasury designated PJAK as a terrorist organization.[50] Moreover, the former PJAK leader Haji Ahmadi has accused the US of fighting the Kurdish rebels alongside Turkey and Iran.[19]PJAK – Free Life Party of Kurdistan: While we are approaching to the eleventh threshold of the presidential election and the sixth period of the city...Treasury Designates Free Life Party of Kurdistan a Terrorist Organization: Washington, DC – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated the Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK), a Kurdish group operating in the border region between Iraq and Iran, under Executive Order 13224 for being controlled by the terrorist group Kongra-Gel (KGK, aka the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK).\n\nWith today's action, we are exposing PJAK's terrorist ties to the KGK and supporting Turkey's efforts to protect its citizens from attack, said Stuart Levey, Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.\n\nDesignated in December 2002 under E.O. 13224, KGK has been involved for more than 20 years in targeting Turkish government security forces, local Turkish officials, and villagers who oppose the KGK in Turkey. Turkish authorities have confirmed or suspect that KGK is also responsible for dozens of bombings since 2004 in western Turkey.\n\nThe KGK leadership authorized certain Iranian-Kurdish KGK members to create a KGK splinter group that would portray itself as independent from but allied with KGK. PJAK was created to appeal to Iranian Kurds. KGK formally institutionalized PJAK in 2004 and selected five KGK members to serve as PJAK leaders, including Hajji Ahmadi, a KGK affiliate who became PJAK's General Secretary. KGK leaders also selected the members of PJAK's 40-person central committee. Although certain PJAK members objected to the KGK selecting their leaders, the KGK advised that PJAK had no choice.\n\nAs of April 2008, KGK leadership controlled PJAK and allocated personnel to the group. Separately, PJAK members have carried out their activities in accordance with orders received from KGK senior leaders. In one instance, PJAK's armed wing, the East Kurdistan Defense Forces, had been acting independently in Iran. KGK senior leaders immediately intervened, however, and recalled the responsible PJAK officials to northern Iraq.\n\nUnder E.O. 13224, any assets PJAK has under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with PJAK.\n\n\n\nFREE LIFE PARTY OF KURDISTAN \n\nAKAs: \n\nKurdistan Free Life Party\n\nParty of Free Life of Kurdistan Partiya Jiyana Azad a Kurdistane \n\nPJAK\n\nPEJAK\n\nPEZHAKNCBI - WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic: Your access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

Fue fundada en Turquía en 1978.\n\nSegún cifras oficiales, la guerra abierta entre el PKK y el Estado turco habría causado al menos 40.000 muertes desde 1984 hasta 2015, en su mayoría combatientes del PKK y civiles. Durante este periodo, gran parte del Kurdistán turco, conocido como Bakur, fue devastado por la estrategia de “tierra quemada” empleada por el ejército turco. En ese mismo año, el PKK trasladó sus bases al Kurdistán iraquí, donde las fuerzas armadas turcas llevan a cabo frecuentes incursiones y ataques aéreos.[1]​\n\nEl fundador del grupo es Abdullah Öcalan, condenado por la justicia turca a cadena perpetua por delitos de traición y separatismo, quien permanece preso desde 1999.[2]​En marzo de 2015, Abdullah Öcalan pidió en una carta enviada desde la cárcel con motivo del Noruz, el año nuevo persa, la convocatoria de un Congreso Extraordinario del PKK para certificar el final de la lucha armada contra el Estado turco, que ha durado ya más de tres décadas, y para decidir - dice la carta - \"las estrategias y tácticas políticas y sociales acordes con el espíritu de una nueva era\". En el Noruz de 2013 Öcalan hizo el primer llamamiento a la declaración de un alto el fuego del PKK en el marco de las negociaciones de paz abiertas desde finales de 2012.[3]​\n\nEs considerado como organización terrorista tanto por el Estado turco como por Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea, que incluyó al PKK en el listado de organizaciones terroristas a petición de Turquía en 2004[4]​[5]​\n\nEl PKK lucha por la independencia de Kurdistán y la autodeterminación de las minorías de las zonas de mayoría kurda siguiendo un modelo confederalista democrático, una ideología que enfatiza el autogobierno de las propias comunidades (democracia directa), el feminismo (jineología) y el anticapitalismo; sintetiza elementos marxistas con elementos anarquistas. Hoy día el PKK lucha por lograr autonomías democráticas en las diferentes partes donde existe el pueblo kurdo, manteniendo un ideal de construcción de una sociedad comunitaria y socialista desde las propias tradiciones de su pueblo.\n\nDesde hace algunos años, el PKK ha ido abandonando sus ideas marxistas-leninistas, las cuales luego de un proceso de discusión iniciado en la década de 2000 los llevó a ir dejando de lado estos principios por otros nuevos, que incorporan elementos ecologistas y confederalistas, inspirados en ideólogos como el ecoanarquista y municipalista libertario estadounidense Murray Bookchin. Esta nueva teoría ha tomado el nombre de \"confederalismo democrático\", y su principal impulsor ha sido Öcalan.[6]​\n\nÖcalan, estudiante de Ciencias Políticas, tomó contacto con activistas políticos y culturales que abordaban la cuestión kurda. Estos opinaban que el problema de Kurdistán podía ser resuelto a través de una serie de reformas, para lo cual volcaron su actividad en el desarrollo de actividades culturales. Por el contrario, Öcalan había comenzado una ofensiva política en 1972 con una conferencia sobre los problemas de la etnia minoritaria kurda en Turquía, afirmando que en Turquía no existía una sola nación, sino que también existía la nación kurda. A partir de entonces, el grupo comienza una intensa actividad política marcando su ideario en el antifascismo, lo cual le permitió ganar un importante número de adeptos en la comunidad universitaria y comenzó a trabajar en la Unión de Estudiantes de Ankara (Ayod).\n\nEn este momento comienza a desarrollarse el cuerpo ideológico del PKK, basado en el antifascismo y un nacionalismo kurdo opuesto al chovinismo y al racismo. También en este momento comienza un intenso debate entre la izquierda tradicional turca y el nacionalismo kurdo.\n\nÖcalan fundó informalmente el partido en 1973 y el grupo comenzó sus actividades en los territorios kurdos de Turquía, principalmente en Urfa, Mus, Batman y Dersim.\n\nEn 1977 tuvo lugar una Asamblea General del PKK a la que asistieron más de 100 representantes de diversas profesiones y observadores de otras organizaciones de izquierdas, mostrando el gran crecimiento del grupo y su paulatina integración en el Kurdistán turco. El PKK tomó la determinación de extender la organización hacia otros poblados y ciudades kurdas. En otoño de ese mismo año se publicó el manifiesto Camino para la emancipación kurda, que dio un marco político al grupo, que hasta entonces había tenido un papel principalmente ideológico y cultural.\n\nEl PKK comenzó oficialmente la lucha armada contra el Estado turco el 15 de agosto de 1984. Según el Gobierno de Turquía, un total de aproximadamente 40.000 personas perdieron la vida en combates entre las Fuerzas Armadas de Turquía (con alrededor de 9.000 bajas) y los milicianos del PKK (con alrededor de 31.000 bajas) desde esa fecha hasta 2015.\n\nSe estima que, a principios de 2015, el PKK cuenta con una fuerza de combate de aproximadamente 30.000 milicianos. Su táctica de combate se basa principalmente en guerra de guerrillas en las zonas montañosas al este y sudeste de Turquía (el Kurdistán turco) aunque también han perpetrado ataques en zonas urbanas.\n\nDesde la década de 2000 el PKK comenzó a cuestionar si la lucha armada era la vía correcta para alcanzar la independencia del Kurdistán. En 2005 se publica un breve libro de la mano de Öcalan que expone un nuevo concepto: el confederalismo democrático. Esta nueva corriente ideológica, basada en la ecología social de Murray Bookchin, si bien no rechaza la posibilidad de la independencia, afirma que aceptarían una confederación, esto es, que las partes del Kurdistán divididas entre varios Estados (Irak, Siria, Irán y Turquía) gocen de un alto grado de autogobierno, de manera similar a un Estado confederal.\n\nLa principal organización que se ha encargado de solidificar estas nuevas teorías ha sido la Koma Civakên Kurdistan (KCK) o Confederación de Pueblos del Kurdistán, creada durante el encarcelamiento de Öcalan. Esta organización es la encargada de coordinar ideológicamente a todas las organizaciones vinculadas al movimiento de liberación kurdo, y engloba más de 600 organizaciones sociales, políticas y culturales de los cuatro territorios que conforman el Kurdistán.\n• Conflicto Turquía-Partido de los Trabajadores de Kurdistán sobre las negociaciones de paz entre el gobierno turco y el PKK\n• Wikimedia Commons alberga una categoría multimedia sobre el PKK."}

El grupo consiste del vocalista y guitarrista Jon Fratelli, el bajista y corista Barry Fratelli, y el baterista y corista Mince Fratelli.\n\nDiferentes fuentes citan diferentes orígenes del nombre de la banda. Algunos dicen que se deriva de la película \"The Goonies\", aunque la banda confirmó que éste no es el caso durante el programa Jonathan Ross Show de la cadena BBC Radio 2 el 9 de septiembre de 2006. De acuerdo a una entrevista para el periódico The Sun, parece que el nombre fue tomado de Barry el bajista, cuyo apellido original es Fratelli, siendo así que los demás miembros de la banda adoptaron este pseudónimo. Otra razón más simple podría ser que \"Fratelli\" es la traducción al italiano de la palabra \"hermanos\".\n\nSu primer EP, The Fratellis EP fue lanzado el 3 de abril de 2006, e incluye las canciones \"Creeping Up The Backstairs\", \"Stacie Anne\" y \"The Gutterati?\". Debido a su disponibilidad limitada, se pueden conseguir copias ahora hasta por más de £30 en eBay. Costello Music se editó el 11 de septiembre del mismo año y obtuvo aclamadas críticas y la posición #2 en las listas de popularidad del Reino Unido.\n\nDesde su surgimiento han sido bastante bien recibidos logrando un sobresaliente año a lo largo de 2006. Tuvieron presentaciones en vivo en los programas Later with Jools Holland y Top of the Pops en junio del 2006, y en la edición del 25 de agosto de The Friday Night Project. La revista musical NME les dedicó un especial de dos páginas en su edición del 10 de agosto proclamándolos como \"la mejor nueva banda en Gran Bretaña\".\n\nEl 23 de abril Jon publicó en el foro oficial de la banda que no tenían planes en un futuro cercano para grabar un tercer disco juntos, esto creó un escándalo en los seguidores de la banda que suponían que era la separación de esta, estos rumores los desmintió Jon, que dijo que simplemente quería dedicarse de tiempo completo a su otra banda, Codeine Velvet Club, y a su carrera como solista.\n\nEn 2013 la banda anuncia su vuelta a los escenarios tras 4 años de inactividad. El 30 de enero confirman su asistencia al festival de música castellonense Arenal Sound.\n• Jon Fratelli (John Lawler): voz y guitarra. Nacido el 4 de marzo de 1979.\n• Barry Fratelli (Barry Wallace): bajo. Nacido el 23 de abril de 1979.\n• Mince Fratelli (Gordon McRory): batería, banjo y voces secundarias. Nacido el 16 de mayo de 1983.\n• Más información y noticias sobre The FratellisDESNUDANDO LA MÚSICA: The Fratellis, una década de infeccioso rock escocés: Diez años han transcurrido desde el debut de una de las bandas escocesas que más nos gusta, The Fratellis. Estupenda oportunidad que se nos brinda para repasar una trayectoria cargada de magníficos temas musicales capaces de levantarnos del asiento y subirnos el ánimo en momentos de abatimiento. Y es que su música, es pura infección enérgica.\n\nDe Glasglow, cuna de bandas míticas, como Jesus & Mary Chain, Texas, Simple Minds, o Belle and Sebastian, proceden John Lawler (cantante y guitarra), Barry Wallace (bajo) y Gordon McRory (batería). Y no, no son hermanos. El supuesto misterio de su nombre no parece ser tal, aunque sigue sembrando dudas. Muchos siguen apostando porque es un homenaje a los villanos de la mítica película Los Goonies; otros al vocablo italiano que se traduce por hermanos.\n\nLa realidad, como ya han confesado en alguna entrevista, es que Fratelli es el apellido de soltera de la madre del Barry y que adoptaron en plan hermandad y homenaje a los Ramones, sustituyéndolo al apellido de cada miembro. Pero lo cierto es que sus declaraciones a la prensa no son tomadas con mucha credibilidad, con razón, todo sea dicho, dado el largo historial de meter trolas que poseen, aburridos de que siempre sean preguntados por lo mismo y motivados por su sentido del humor.\n\nCon nombre homónimo lanzan en 2006 su primer EP, con tres temas, Creepin’ Up the backstairs, Stacie Anne y The Gutterati? Pocos meses después cautivan a crítica y público con su álbum Costello Music, grabado en Los Ángeles, que les eleva al número 2 de las listas británicas y con el que consiguen el premio a mejor artista británico revelación de 2007. El título, por cierto, homenajea a un local de ensayo de su ciudad natal. Los temas que lo componen son pegadizos, plagados de melodías pop rock fantásticas, así como letras disparatadas. Es difícil destacar solo algunos temas de un abanico de canciones sin desperdicio (para ejemplo, siete de las trece composiciones se lanzaron como singles). Aparte de la ya nombrada del EP (única incluida en el álbum), tenemos Baby Fratelli, Henrietta o Cuntry boys and city girls, Su canción Flathead fue banda sonora de un anuncio del todopoderoso Ipod y Chelsea Dagger se ha transformado en un auténtico himno deportivo, tanto para el futbol (Celtic FC), como para el hockey, en el que Los Leones de Zurich y los Blackhawks de Chicago lo han convertido en su canción de la victoria en los encuentros deportivos\n\nInevitables fueron las comparaciones con sus vecinos de Glasgow, los estupendos Franz Ferdinand, que tenían muy reciente el lanzamiento de su segundo disco, You could have it so much better. Ellos tan pulcros y elegantes y The Fratellis, en el otro extremo, los gamberros divertidos de taberna, si bien siempre se han defendido de esta etiqueta diciendo que son una banda de rock, no un grupo de hooligans.\n\nSu segundo álbum, Here we stand (2008) fue considerado más maduro, puro sonido de rock inglés, si bien una de sus señas de identidad es la mezcla de estilos, en este caso el country o el garaje rock. No estuvo exento de polémicas. Su tema Jesus stole my baby fue prohibida en Estados Unidos y eliminada del disco en dicho país. Escándalos aparte, hallamos temas dignos de ser escuchados incesantemente como My friend John, A heady tale o Shameless.\n\nTras este disco, para sorpresa de todos, se anuncia su separación, teniendo cada uno la mente puesta en otros proyectos. Barry, Mince y Jon forman bandas independientes, The Twat, Mince o’Diablo y Codeine Velvet Club respectivamente.\n\nSi no habían dejado pistas sobre si su separación era definitiva o temporal, en 2012 vuelen a reunirse para lanzar su tercer álbum We need medicine (2013). Sin tener la calidad de los primeros, consigue meterse en las listas británicas y americanas (y japonesas) gracias a canciones como la de aires country Seven nights, seven days o Jeannie Nitro.\n\nLo último de los escoceses lo grabaron el año pasado con el título de Eyes wide, Tongue tied (2015) bajo la misma producción que su primer álbum (Tony Hoffer, el mismo que ha apostado por grandes como Depeche Mode o Belle & Sebastian entre otros). Se aúpan hasta el puesto 16 de las listas patrias y aportan un puñado de temas destacado como la formidable Baby, you don’t lie to me, Impostors, Thief o Me and the devil.\n\nTerminamos el post con la canción Henrietta, de su primer álbum, Costello Music, primer single y con el que consiguieron la fama. El tema trata de la proposición de tres chicos hacia una mujer para que se vaya con ellos y abandone su vida marital con un hombre que no le hace feliz. Como las interpretaciones son libres, muchos la consideraron un metáfora de la heroína, algo que los escoceses desmintieron tajantemente. Sea como fuere, disfruten.The Fratellis: Half Drunk Under A Full Moon DIGITAL DELUXE edition IS OUT now. Available across digital platforms.The Fratellis: A brashly melodic indie rock outfit from Glasgow, the Fratellis seemed to emerge fully formed from the Babyshambles -inspired boho-chic scene that also spawned the Rakes and the Paddingtons . Their debut full-length Costello Music (2006) mixed the tried-and-true sounds of glam rock, stripped-down acousticisms, and Class of 1977 punk, featuring a pair of Top Ten hits in the U.K., \"Chelsea Dagger\" and \"Whistle for the Choir.\" (In time-honored punk fashion, the three bandmembers all used the surname Fratelli.) Subsequent records earned Top Ten placings in the local Scottish charts, including 2008's Here We Stand, 2015's Eyes Wide, Tongue Tied, and 2018's In Your Own Sweet Time. The Fratellis were formed by vocalist/guitarist Jon Fratelli , drummer Mince Fratelli, and bassist Barry Fratelli. The witty trio played its first show in early 2005, maintaining that the band's moniker was merely an homage to Barry's original surname (however, other rumors suggest that the Fratellis borrowed it from the nemesis family featured in Steven Spielberg's film The Goonies). Such trivia only added to the Fratellis' growing appeal upon their debut, and the band's limited-edition self-titled EP arrived in April 2006. Although few copies were pressed, the record received a helpful boost from Zane Lowe 's Radio One program, which put the acoustic-driven track \"Creepin Up the Backstairs\" into regular rotation. Televised appearances on Later with Jools Holland and Top of the Pops followed during the early summer, while the group's second single, \"Henrietta,\" earned the Fratellis their first U.K. Top 20 hit. \"Chelsea Dagger\" began climbing the U.K. Top 40 that August, and the debut album, Costello Music, finally arrived in September. Although the album failed to chart in most countries (even an American iPod commercial featuring the track \"Flathead\" failed to spark much interest across the pond), Costello Music enjoyed a great deal of success at home, earning the bandmates a BRIT Award and peaking at number two in their native U.K. The Fratellis returned to the British charts in 2008 with \"Mistress Mabel,\" a track from their polished sophomore effort, Here We Stand. The band then went on hiatus for a few years; during that time, Jon formed the torchy duo Codeine Velvet Club in 2008 with Lou Hickey and released a solo album, Psycho Jukebox, in 2011. Meanwhile, Barry joined the Twang as a touring member and Mince played with Jon 's backing band as well as with Throne o' Diablo. During this time, \"Chelsea Dagger\" also became the unofficial theme song of the National Hockey League's Chicago Blackhawks. In 2012, the Fratellis regrouped for a U.K. tour and announced in 2013 that they had recorded their third studio album in their native Glasgow. We Need Medicine arrived in October 2013. By the end of the year, they were already writing songs, some of which appeared on the Soul Crush EP, available as a free download on the band's website. The Fratellis recorded their fourth album in Los Angeles with producer Tony Hoffer (who'd also produced their debut); preceded by the singles \"Me and the Devil\" and \"Baby Don't You Lie,\" Eyes Wide, Tongue Tied was released in August 2015. The following year, the band celebrated the tenth anniversary of Costello Music with a U.K. tour. In 2017, they began work with Hoffer on their fifth album. Preceded by the disco-tinged track \"The Next Time We Wed,\" In Your Own Sweet Time appeared in March 2018. The Fratellis headed back into the studio in L.A. with Hoffer to record their next outing, 2021's Half Drunk Under a Full Moon. ~ Andrew Leahey & MacKenzie Wilson, RoviReddit - Dive into anything: I know they’re label as an “alternative” band on most things you look up but every album they have sounds different from one another in their own unique way. Costello Music and Here We Stand are the only albums in my opinion that I would classify as alternative. I know it’s such a broad category though, I’m just curious about other people’s opinion.\n\nAlso I’m curious what you’d label, Jon’s last album as. In my opinion it sounds like it has a lot of country influences in it."}

Celebrada en la montaña de Montjuic, se desarrolló en una superficie de 118 hectáreas y tuvo un coste de 130 millones de pesetas.[2]​ Entre la veintena europea de naciones que oficialmente participaron estaban países como Alemania, Bélgica, Dinamarca, Francia, Hungría, Italia, Noruega, Rumanía y Suiza. También participaron expositores privados japoneses y estadounidenses.\n\nEn Barcelona se guardaba un grato recuerdo de la Exposición Universal de 1888, que supuso un gran avance para la ciudad en el terreno económico y tecnológico, así como la remodelación del parque de la Ciudadela. Por eso se proyectó esta nueva exposición para dar a conocer los nuevos adelantos tecnológicos y proyectar la imagen de la industria catalana en el exterior. De nuevo, la exposición originó una remodelación de una parte de la ciudad, en este caso la montaña de Montjuic, así como de sus zonas colindantes, especialmente la plaza de España.\n\nLa Exposición supuso un gran desarrollo urbanístico para Barcelona, así como un banco de pruebas para los nuevos estilos arquitectónicos gestados a principios del siglo XX; a nivel local, representó la consolidación del novecentismo, estilo de corte clásico que sustituyó al modernismo preponderante en Cataluña durante la transición de siglo; además, supuso la introducción en España de las corrientes de vanguardia internacionales, especialmente el racionalismo, a través del Pabellón de Alemania de Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.[3]​ La Exposición dejó numerosos edificios e instalaciones, algunos de los cuales se han convertido en emblemas de la ciudad, como el Palacio Nacional, la Fuente Mágica, el Teatro Griego, el Pueblo Español y el Estadio Olímpico.\n\nLa idea de una nueva exposición comenzó a gestarse en 1905, promovida por el arquitecto Josep Puig i Cadafalch, como una forma de llevar a cabo el nuevo Plan de Enlaces diseñado por Léon Jaussely.[3]​ Inicialmente se pensó que el recinto de la exposición estuviese en la zona del Besós, pero en 1913 se decidió su ubicación definitiva en Montjuic. Debido al auge de la industria eléctrica desde finales del siglo XIX se pensó realizar una Exposición de Industrias Eléctricas, prevista inicialmente para 1917, aunque se retrasó debido a la Primera Guerra Mundial.\n\nEl proyecto de Puig i Cadafalch recibió el respaldo de la institución empresarial Fomento del Trabajo Nacional, especialmente de Francesc d’Assís Mas, uno de sus dirigentes, que se encargó de las negociaciones con los diversos organismos oficiales implicados en el proyecto. Así, en 1913 se creó una comisión mixta para la organización del evento, formada por representantes del Fomento Nacional del Trabajo y del Ayuntamiento, siendo nombrados comisarios de la organización Josep Puig i Cadafalch, Francesc Cambó y Juan Pich y Pon.[4]​\n\nEn 1915 se presentó un primer anteproyecto a cargo de Puig i Cadafalch, que se dividió en tres proyectos más concretos, cada uno encargado a un equipo de arquitectos: Puig i Cadafalch —con Guillem Busquets— se reservó la parte baja de la montaña, destinada a la Sección Oficial; Lluís Domènech i Montaner y Manuel Vega y March se encargaron de la parte alta de la montaña, destinada a Sección Internacional; y Enric Sagnier y Augusto Font Carreras desarrollaron el sector de Miramar, destinado a una posible Sección Marítima del certamen que finalmente no se llevó a cabo.[5]​\n\nLa primera dificultad fue la consecución de los terrenos, ya que para la exposición hacían falta al menos 110 hectáreas, y el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona solo poseía 26 en 1914. Se tuvo que recurrir a la expropiación de terrenos, conforme a una ley de 1879 para la expropiación de terrenos con fines públicos.[6]​ En 1917 comenzaron las obras de urbanización de la montaña de Montjuic, a cargo del ingeniero Mariano Rubió y Bellver. El proyecto de ajardinamiento corrió a cargo de Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, que contó con la colaboración de Nicolás María Rubió y Tudurí; realizaron un conjunto de marcado carácter mediterráneo, de gusto clasicista, combinando los jardines con la construcción de pérgolas y terrazas. Igualmente, se construyó un funicular para acceder hasta lo alto de la montaña, así como un transbordador aéreo para acceder a la misma desde el puerto de Barcelona, aunque fue inaugurado posteriormente (1931).\n\nLas obras se retrasaron varios años, siendo finalizadas en 1923; sin embargo, la instauración ese año de la dictadura de Primo de Rivera postergó la celebración del evento, que finalmente se produjo en 1929, coincidiendo con la Exposición Iberoamericana de Sevilla.[7]​ Asimismo, el paso del tiempo dejó obsoleto el objetivo de dedicar la Exposición a las Industrias Eléctricas, decidiéndose en 1925 que se denominaría Exposición Internacional de Barcelona. El cambio de objetivo hizo que se reorganizase la Exposición dedicándola a tres vertientes: la industria, los deportes y el arte. En este nuevo periodo la organización recayó en manos del marqués de Foronda, siendo nombrado Pere Domènech i Roura director de las obras.[8]​\n\nEl desarrollo posterior del certamen evidenció una gran variedad estilística en los edificios construidos por diversos arquitectos, algunos fieles al novecentismo imperante en la época, pero otros recurrentes a tendencias historicistas y eclécticas que pervivían desde finales del siglo XIX, con especial influencia del arte barroco español. Pese a esta diversidad, un sello común a todas las construcciones —al menos, las oficiales—, fue un sentido monumental y grandilocuente de concebir la arquitectura. En cambio, en los pabellones privados y de la Sección Internacional se encontraban soluciones más avanzadas, paralelas a las corrientes de vanguardia de la época, principalmente el art déco y el racionalismo, en las que además subyacía la intención de conjugar funcionalismo y estética.[9]​\n\nLa inauguración, efectuada por el rey Alfonso XIII, se realizó el 19 de mayo de 1929, y contó con la asistencia del presidente del gobierno, Miguel Primo de Rivera, y la de múltiples personalidades del mundo de la política, la economía y la cultura catalanas, encabezados por el alcalde Darío Rumeu y Freixa, barón de Viver, y por Manuel de Álvarez-Cuevas y Olivella, presidente del Comité organizador. Asimismo, asistieron unas 200 000 personas entre el público en general.[10]​\n\nLa Exposición dejó un saldo final de un déficit de unos 180 millones de pesetas. Su éxito fue relativo: durante su celebración se produjo el célebre crac de la bolsa de Nueva York, el 29 de octubre de 1929, lo que redujo el número de participantes en el certamen. Pese a todo, sí se consiguió un gran éxito a nivel social, con gran afluencia de público, y los logros conseguidos para la ciudad, sobre todo a nivel arquitectónico y urbanístico, hicieron de la Exposición un evento de primera magnitud para la historia de Barcelona.[11]​\n\nEl recinto de la Exposición se construyó según el proyecto de Puig i Cadafalch, con dos distintas tipologías de edificios: los palacios, dedicados a las secciones oficiales del certamen, y los pabellones, que representaban países, instituciones o sociedades.[12]​ El conjunto comenzaba en la plaza de España, donde se construyeron cuatro grandes hoteles para los visitantes, pasando por la avenida de América (actual avenida de la Reina María Cristina), donde se ubicaban los grandes edificios de la Exposición, hasta el pie de la montaña, donde se situó la Fuente Mágica, flanqueada por los palacios de Alfonso XIII y Victoria Eugenia; de aquí partía una escalinata que conducía al Palacio Nacional, la obra más monumental de la Exposición.\n\nLa avenida de la Reina María Cristina se decoró con surtidores de agua y columnas de vidrio iluminadas por luz eléctrica, obra de Carles Buïgas, que causaron una gran sensación. A ambos lados de la avenida se encontraban los edificios principales de la Exposición: el Palacio del Vestido, el Palacio de Comunicaciones y Transportes y el Palacio de la Metalurgia, Electricidad y Fuerza Motriz; dicho conjunto arquitectónico constituye actualmente la Feria de Muestras de Barcelona. Junto a la avenida se encontraba la plaza de la Mecánica (actualmente del Universo), en cuyo centro se situaba la Torre de la Luz, una fuente luminosa (Jardín de Agua-Luz), obra de Buïgas, y la escultura El trabajo, de Josep Llimona.[13]​\n\nLa plaza de España fue proyectada por Ildefonso Cerdá en su proyecto de Ensanche como vía de comunicación entre Barcelona y las poblaciones del Bajo Llobregat. Después de un primer proyecto para urbanizar la plaza de Josep Amargós (1915), finalmente se encargaron de las obras Josep Puig i Cadafalch y Guillem Busquets, continuadas por Antoni Darder desde 1926.[14]​ Diseñaron un conjunto monumental de forma circular, en torno a un hemiciclo formado por una columnata de estilo barroco, influenciada en la plaza de San Pedro de la Ciudad del Vaticano de Bernini. En la plaza se construyeron los hoteles de la exposición, obra de Nicolás María Rubió y Tudurí, de los que solo queda en pie el situado entre la Gran Vía y la calle Creu Coberta, actualmente destinado al CEIP \"Francesc Macià\" y al Instituto Municipal de Educación.\n\nEn el acceso de la plaza que conduce a la avenida de la Reina María Cristina se situaron dos altas torres en forma de campaniles, obra de Ramon Reventós, inspirados en el campanile de San Marcos de Venecia. A los pies de las torres había una balaustrada de acceso al recinto de la Exposición decorada con cuatro esculturas: las Artes y la Industria, de Carles Ridaura; el Comercio, de Enric Monjo; y el Deporte, de Josep Viladomat. Esta balaustrada fue eliminada en los años 1970 durante una reurbanización de la plaza debido a las obras del metro, y junto a ella desaparecieron las estatuas; tan solo se conservó una, la de las Artes —también llamada Mujer con niño—, trasladada a un lugar cercano, en la avenida del Paralelo cerca de la esquina con la calle de Lérida.[15]​\n\nEn el centro de la plaza —donde anteriormente se encontraba un templete con la cruz de término de la ciudad en la antigua carretera de Madrid, actualmente calle de la Cruz Cubierta— figura una fuente monumental diseñada por Josep Maria Jujol, con una ornamentada decoración escultórica obra de Miguel Blay y los hermanos Miquel y Llucià Oslé. De inspiración clásica, el sentido iconográfico de la obra representa una alegoría poética a España: sobre un estanque de planta triangular se sitúa un edículo con tres nichos con grupos escultóricos que simbolizan los ríos que desembocan en los tres mares que rodean la península ibérica, el Ebro (Mediterráneo), el Guadalquivir y el Tajo (Atlántico) y unas figuras de adolescentes para los ríos del mar Cantábrico, obra de Blay; en los vértices del estanque se sitúan tres grupos que representan los frutos y dones de las aguas: la Abundancia, la Salud Pública y la Pesca y la Navegación, obra de los hermanos Oslé; alrededor del cuerpo central se sitúan tres columnas con diversas figuras y emblemas que simbolizan la Religión (una cruz con Ramon Llull, santa Teresa de Jesús y san Ignacio de Loyola), el Heroísmo (una espada con Don Pelayo, Jaime I de Aragón e Isabel la Católica), y las Artes (un libro con Ausiàs March y Miguel de Cervantes); remata la obra un pebetero de fuego con tres Victorias.[16]​\n\nAl final de la avenida y al pie de la montaña se construyó la famosa Fuente Mágica de Montjuic, obra de Carles Buïgas, que asombró al público por su fantástico juego de luces y surtidores de agua;[17]​ aún hoy es una obra emblemática de la capital catalana, donde suelen celebrarse espectáculos piromusicales en las fiestas de la Mercè y todos los fines de semana del año se ponen en marcha en un recital de agua, luz, color y música (añadida a finales de los años 80). Es de forma elipsoidal, formada por tres estanques concéntricos a distintos niveles, con 65 m de diámetro en su parte más ancha. Accionada por un motor de 1100 CV, tiene un caudal de 2600 l/s, con treinta juegos de agua diferentes, con sus correspondientes coloraciones graduales, basadas en cinco colores: amarillo, azul, verde, rojo y blanco. Fue construida por técnicos de la compañía Westinghouse.[18]​\n\nEn principio se construyeron en ese lugar cuatro columnas de estilo jónico que simbolizaban la bandera catalana, obra de Puig i Cadafalch, pero el dictador Primo de Rivera las mandó derribar. Con el restablecimiento de la democracia surgieron diversas voces que proponían reconstruir las columnas, proyecto que se llevó a cabo entre 2010 y 2011 por el equipo de arquitectos Rosselló-Sangenís, un poco más arriba de su emplazamiento original. Fueron inauguradas el 27 de febrero de 2011 por el presidente de la Generalidad de Cataluña, Artur Mas, y el alcalde de Barcelona, Jordi Hereu.[19]​\n• Las antiguas cuatro columnas , derribadas en 1928\n\nObra de Félix de Azúa y Adolfo Florensa según un proyecto de 1926, presenta una línea de estilo neoclásico inspirado en la arquitectura académica francesa. Era de los edificios más grandes de la Exposición, con una superficie de 16 000 m². Con fachada a la plaza de España y a la avenida de la Reina María Cristina, su estructura está articulada alrededor del hemiciclo con columnata proyectado para la plaza de España. En la parte de la avenida de la Reina María Cristina presenta otra fachada en forma de arco de triunfo rematada con un grupo escultórico donde destaca la figura de una Victoria. En la actualidad forma parte de la Feria de Muestras de Barcelona.[20]​\n\nInicialmente llamado Palacio de la Pedagogía, Higiene e Instituciones Sociales, fue obra de Josep Maria Jujol y Andrés Calzada, situado entre la plaza de España y la avenida de la Reina María Cristina. Con una superficie de 6500 m², como el Palacio de Comunicaciones y Transportes tuvo que adaptar su estructura al hemiciclo con columnata proyectado para la plaza de España, presentando una planta irregular dispuesta alrededor de un espacio central con una gran rotonda rematada por una cúpula de estilo oriental. Este palacio también forma parte de la Feria de Muestras de Barcelona.[21]​\n\nObra de Amadeu Llopart y Alexandre Soler i March, dispone de una superficie de 16 000 m². De planta rectangular, destaca en la parte central una gran cúpula poliédrica, sobre tambor y con linterna, quizá inspirada en el pabellón de vidrio que Bruno Taut construyó para la Deutscher Werkbund de Colonia (1914). La fachada destaca por un gran frontón clásico decorado con pinturas al fresco de Francesc d'Assís Galí, que también pintó unos plafones para la galería de entrada junto a Josep Obiols y Manuel Humbert. A los lados se sitúan unos torreones con esculturas alegóricas de Enric Casanovas. Este palacio también forma parte de la Feria de Muestras de Barcelona.[22]​\n\nObra de Joan Roig y Emili Canosa, estaba situado entre el Palacio de Comunicaciones y Transportes y el de Proyecciones, con entrada por la plaza del Universo. Con una superficie de 20 000 m², estaba dedicado a la industria textil, con casetas de empresas españolas, alemanas, austriacas, francesas, italianas y suizas. Presentaba un cuerpo central de estilo renacentista, mientras que la fachada, de mayor verticalidad, era de estilo neoclásico, con una balaustrada de crestería plateresca y dos torres rematadas por cúpula y linterna. En su interior destacaba el expositor de la seda, promovido por Alemania y diseñado por Ludwig Mies van der Rohe y Lilly Reich, un espacio diáfano de estructura neoplasticista donde, mediante una hábil distribución del espacio, se conseguía el efecto de un espacio abierto por todos sus lados. En su lugar se construyó el Palacio del Cincuentenario, perteneciente a la Feria de Muestras de Barcelona.[23]​\n\nObra de Eusebi Bona y Francisco Aznar, se encontraba entre la avenida de la Reina María Cristina, la avenida Rius i Taulet y la plaza del Universo. Con una superficie de 10 000 m², tenía dos plantas, la principal con una gran sala de espectáculos, con escenario y cabina para la proyección de películas, y diversas salas de exposiciones. Del edificio destacaba la fachada, de estilo clásico y monumental, con decoración escultórica de Joan Pueyo: cuatro grupos de cariátides con bisontes, cuatro grupos de esfinges y dos fuentes, realizados en piedra artificial. Derribado tras la Exposición, en su lugar se construyó el actual Palacio de Congresos. Junto a este palacio se encontraban las Oficinas de la Exposición, obra de Juan Bruguera, actualmente un colegio (CEIP Jacint Verdaguer).[24]​\n\nLlamados inicialmente del Arte Moderno y de la Arquitectura, son obra de Josep Puig i Cadafalch, situados simétricamente junto a la Fuente Mágica, a los pies del Palacio Nacional. Fueron los primeros edificios en construirse, siendo terminados en 1923, fecha en la que acogieron una Exposición del Mueble y la Decoración interior, como ensayo inicial del posterior evento. Con una superficie de 14 000 m² cada uno, tienen planta rectangular, formada por módulos cuadrangulares dispuestos a modo de retícula. Las fachadas están inspiradas en el barroco catalán, con un conjunto de cuatro torres por edificio, rematadas por unos pináculos de forma piramidal, y decoración de esgrafiados en los muros, representando columnas salomónicas y motivos vegetales. El Palacio de Alfonso XIII se dedicó a la Construcción, mientras que en el de Victoria Eugenia se situaron las representaciones de países que no contaban con pabellón propio.[25]​\n\nEdificio principal de la Exposición, fue obra de Eugenio Cendoya y Enric Catà, bajo la supervisión de Pere Domènech i Roura, desestimando el proyecto inicial de Puig i Cadafalch y Guillem Busquets. Construido entre 1926 y 1929, tiene una superficie de 32 000 m². De estilo clasicista inspirado en el Renacimiento español, tiene planta rectangular con dos cuerpos laterales y uno posterior cuadrado, con una gran cúpula elíptica en la parte central. Las cascadas y surtidores de la escalinata del Palacio fueron obra nuevamente de Carles Buïgas, y se colocaron nueve grandes proyectores que aún hoy emiten unos intensos haces de luz que escriben el nombre de la ciudad en el cielo.[26]​ En su Salón Oval se efectuó la ceremonia de inauguración, presidida por Alfonso XIII y la reina Victoria Eugenia. El Palacio Nacional se dedicó a una exposición de arte español con más de 5000 obras procedentes de todo el territorio del estado[27]​. En su decoración —de estilo novecentista, contrariamente al clasicismo de la obra arquitectónica—, intervinieron diversos artistas, como los escultores Enric Casanovas, Josep Dunyach, Frederic Marès y Josep Llimona, y los pintores Francesc d'Assís Galí, Josep de Togores, Manuel Humbert, Josep Obiols, Joan Colom y Francesc Labarta. Desde 1934 acoge el Museo Nacional de Arte de Cataluña.[28]​\n\nObra de Josep Goday, de estilo novecentista, contenía la representación oficial de la ciudad anfitriona. Situado entre la plaza de los Bellos Oficios (hoy de Carles Buïgas), la avenida de la Técnica (actual calle de la Guardia Urbana), la avenida Rius i Taulet y el Palacio de Alfonso XIII, tenía una superficie de 2115 m². De planta rectangular, se construyó en ladrillo y piedra de Montjuic, con una fachada de estilo clásico con arquerías y esculturas, obra de Frederic Marès, Pere Jou y Eusebi Arnau. En la actualidad es la sede de la Guardia Urbana de Barcelona, junto con el Palacio de la Prensa.[29]​\n\nDedicado a las revistas y diarios publicados en la época en Barcelona, fue obra de Pere Domènech i Roura. Situado en la avenida Rius i Taulet, actualmente es sede de la Guardia Urbana de Barcelona. Con una superficie de 600 m², tiene sótano y tres plantas, con una concepción historicista mezcla de diversos estilos: neomudéjar, neorrománico, neogótico, etc. Domènech utilizó diversos elementos de corte modernista, seguramente por influencia de su padre, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, como el uso de ladrillos caravista, hierro y cerámica.[30]​\n\nSituado entre la calle Lérida y la avenida de la Técnica, fue obra de Manuel Casas y Manuel Puig, con una superficie de 12 000 m². La planta se articulaba alrededor de un patio central, cubierto por una estructura de cristal de forma rectangular; el resto del edificio evocaba al barroco francés, con un aire de gran monumentalidad. La fachada presentaba un juego de volúmenes entrantes y salientes, donde destacaban dos grandes torres rematadas con cúpula y linterna. En su lugar se construyó en 1955 el Palacio de los Deportes de Barcelona, actual Teatro Musical.[31]​\n\nSituado en el Paseo de Santa Madrona, fue obra de Raimundo Durán y Pelayo Martínez, de estilo novecentista con influencia del Renacimiento italiano, especialmente de Brunelleschi, Bramante y Palladio. Con una superficie de 4000 m², estaba dedicado a las artes gráficas, especialmente la impresión de libros. Presenta un acceso con escalinata y dos rampas laterales para vehículos, con una fachada formada por galerías porticadas, con unos templetes laterales y un tambor central sobre el que se eleva una cúpula. De nuevo destacó el expositor alemán, obra de Mies van der Rohe y Lilly Reich, compuesto por vitrinas de formas geométricas. Desde 1935 alberga el Museo de Arqueología de Cataluña.[32]​\n\nObra de Josep Maria Ribas y Manuel Maria Mayol, se sitúa entre el Paseo de Santa Madrona y la calle Lérida. Con una superficie de 16 000 m², se articula alrededor de un patio central y presenta cinco naves rectangulares y dos galerías porticadas. Influenciado en el Renacimiento italiano —especialmente lombardo—, las diversas fachadas de los módulos están recubiertas de estuco y cerámica, y presentan diversas torres octogonales y arquerías triples. Actualmente es conocido como «Mercat de les Flors» (Mercado de las Flores) y está ocupado por la Ciudad del Teatro, que comprende el Instituto del Teatro, la Fundación Teatre Lliure, el Teatro Municipal Mercat de les Flors y el Teatro Fabià Puigserver.[33]​\n\nObra de Antoni Darder, con una superficie de 4500 m², estaba destinado a la representación del Gobierno y los distintos ministerios. Presentaba un cuerpo central y dos laterales simétricos, con torreones en los extremos, de inspiración plateresca, con arcos de medio punto y columnas de orden corintio. Fue derribado tras la Exposición.[34]​\n\nObra de Enric Sagnier, se encontraba entre la avenida del Marqués de Comillas y la de Montanyans, frente a la plaza de la Hidráulica (actualmente de Sant Jordi) —donde se colocó la fuente de Ceres y una escultura ecuestre de San Jorge de Josep Llimona—. Con una superficie de 2350 m², estaba dedicado a la representación de las diputaciones provinciales españolas. De estilo gótico-plateresco, la fachada principal tenía forma cóncava, con una torre central y dos cuerpos laterales simétricos con una crestería almenada, rematados en sus extremos por torreones. En la fachada figuraban el escudo real y los de Cataluña, León y Barcelona.[35]​\n\nObra de Antoni Sardà, estaba destinado a mostrar material deportivo, pero en el último momento se cambió su función para dedicarlo a la industria química. Con una superficie de 4500 m², se encontraba en la avenida de Montanyans, junto al Palacio de las Diputaciones. De estilo clásico, la fachada principal estaba dividida en tres secciones, la central con una columnata de acceso y una cúpula nervada sobre un tambor decagonal. Desde 1932 hasta 1962 —en que fue destruido por un incendio— fue sede de los Estudios Cinematográficos Orphea.[36]​\n\nConocido actualmente como Palacio de Albéniz, albergaba la representación de la Casa Real española. Situado cerca del Estadio, en medio de unos amplios jardines, fue obra de Juan Moya, de estilo barroco inspirado en la arquitectura palaciega francesa del siglo XVIII. La decoración interior es de estilo imperio, destacando unos tapices diseñados por Francisco de Goya y una sala de espejos copiada de Versalles. Ampliado en 1970 y decorado con pinturas de Salvador Dalí, se emplea actualmente en ciertas ceremonias y actos públicos.[37]​\n\nObra de Antoni Darder de 1927, tenía una superficie de 5000 m², situado entre el Pabellón Real y el Palacio de las Misiones. Formaba parte de la sección «El Arte en España», albergando colecciones de pintura, escultura, dibujo y grabado del siglo XIX. De planta rectangular, la fachada principal tenía un cuerpo central y dos laterales simétricos, con una estructura central en forma de arquería de medio punto que recordaba la obra del arquitecto italiano Filippo Juvara.[38]​\n\nObra de Antoni Darder, tenía una superficie de 5000 m², dedicados a dar a conocer la labor de las instituciones misioneras, que prepararon stands con maniquíes que reproducían escenas de costumbres y de labor misional.[39]​ La fachada principal estaba inspirada en las iglesias románicas, con arcos de medio punto confeccionados con dovelas, ventanas alargadas y estrechas y un remate de forma pentagonal. El edificio era de planta rectangular, con una cúpula octogonal inspirada en el Renacimiento italiano. Durante la Guerra Civil sirvió como prisión, y posteriormente fue un refugio de indigentes y reclusión de inmigrantes pobres, principalmente andaluces, a espera de su expulsión a sus lugares de origen. Finalmente fue derribado en 1969.[40]​[41]​[42]​\n\nObra de Antoni Millàs, se encontraba en la avenida Internacional (actual avenida del Estadio). Con una superficie de 26 000 m², tenía planta rectangular formada por tres naves cubiertas por módulos cuadrados con aperturas en forma de claraboyas. Estaba situado en un terreno inicialmente previsto para instalar un campo de aviación, que finalmente no se construyó.[43]​\n• Palacio de las Artes Decorativas y Aplicadas\n\nDebido a la coincidencia con la Exposición Iberoamericana de Sevilla, en Barcelona no participó ningún país de Hispanoamérica. Del resto de países, participaron de forma oficial Alemania, Austria, Bélgica, Checoslovaquia, Dinamarca, Finlandia, Francia, Hungría, Italia, Noruega, Rumanía, Suecia, Suiza y el Reino de los Serbios, Croatas y Eslovenos (posterior Yugoslavia); la mayoría de estos países tuvieron pabellón propio, excepto Austria, Checoslovaquia, Finlandia y Suiza. Además de estos países, participaron de forma no oficial Estados Unidos, Japón, Países Bajos, Portugal y Reino Unido. Cada país tuvo una semana dedicada a lo largo del evento, destacando durante la semana alemana el vuelo del dirigible Graf Zeppelin sobre Barcelona, el 16 de mayo de 1929.\n• Pabellón de Alemania: es considerado como una de las obras maestras de su arquitecto, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe 44 ​. Se trata de uno de los mejores ejemplos de la arquitectura de estilo internacional por su pureza formal, su concepción espacial y su inteligente empleo de estructuras y materiales, que convirtieron a este pabellón en el paradigma de la arquitectura del siglo . Mies y la especialista en exposiciones Lilly Reich recibieron en 1928 el encargo de construir el pabellón oficial de Alemania junto con el del Suministro de Electricidad y varios expositores en palacios de la Sección Oficial. De planta rectangular, se elevaba sobre un podio recubierto de travertino; la cubierta se sostenía sobre columnas cruciformes y muros de carga, con paredes de distintos materiales (ladrillo recubierto de yeso, acero recubierto de mármol verde y de ónice de Marruecos). La utilización de planos de colores es característica de las exhibiciones que Reich había organizado previamente. 45 ​ La decoración se reducía a dos estanques y una escultura, La Mañana, de Georg Kolbe. Demolido después de la Exposición, fue reconstruido entre 1985 y 1987 en su emplazamiento original por Cristian Cirici, Ignasi de Solà-Morales y Fernando Ramos, siguiendo los planos dejados por Mies van der Rohe. 46 ​\n• Pabellón de Bélgica: obra del arquitecto Verhelle, 47 ​ se encontraba junto al pabellón de España. De planta cuadrangular, estaba inspirado en el Hof von Busleyden de Malinas, construido en la época en que Margarita de Austria fijó la corte en esa localidad, 48 ​ destacando una alta torre «beffroi» que doblaba la altura del edificio.\n• Pabellón de Dinamarca: obra de Tyge Hvass, era un diedro de madera rojiza y tejado a dos aguas, evocando una típica casa de montaña danesa. En la fachada destacaba un relieve con la bandera danesa, un ancla, un haz de trigo y una rueda dentada, elementos típicos de la economía danesa. 49 ​\n• Pabellón de Francia: obra de Georges Wybo, de estilo clasicista con elementos de art déco, se encontraba junto al Palacio de Alfonso XIII. Se trataba de un edificio de volumen único en forma de cubo, con cubierta formada por secciones rectangulares superpuestas de forma escalonada, como un zigurat, con una escultura en la parte frontal con forma de mujer y las iniciales R. F. (République Française). 50 ​\n• Pabellón de Hungría: obra de Dénes György y Nikolaus Menyhért, estaba formado por dos cuerpos rectangulares, con una torre sobresaliente en forma de prisma. Exponente de la arquitectura expresionista, la síntesis geométrica de su estructura evocaba la arquitectura de las civilizaciones precolombinas. 51 ​\n• Pabellón de Italia: obra de Piero Portaluppi, se encontraba entre los pabellones de España y Suecia. Tenía una superficie de 4500 m², con planta en forma de U, de estilo clásico renacentista y aire monumental. En la fachada destacaban unas columnas con el águila imperial romana, un friso con el nombre del país y un frontón rematado con una estatua de Minerva. 52 ​\n• Pabellón de Noruega: obra de Ole Lind Schistad, era de madera, como el danés, evocando igualmente una construcción de montaña, con ventanas de porticones y cubierta inclinada. 53 ​\n• Pabellón del Reino de los Serbios, Croatas y Eslovenos: representación del país que posteriormente se llamaría Yugoslavia, fue obra del arquitecto Dragiša Brašovan, situándose junto al Palacio Nacional. De concepción vanguardista, tenía planta en forma de estrella, y la fachada estaba confeccionada con listones de madera dispuestos en franjas horizontales, alternando el blanco y el negro. 54 ​\n• Pabellón de Rumanía: obra de Duiliu Marcu, tenía planta rectangular, con una torre lateral y cubierta a dos aguas, con revestimiento de madera y estuco. La fachada presentaba una arquería que acababa en forma de pérgola, con elementos arquitectónicos característicos de Transilvania. 53 ​\n• Pabellón de Suecia: obra de Peder Clason, como el resto de pabellones escandinavos era de madera, con planta rectangular y una estructura geométrica inscrita dentro de las corrientes de vanguardia del momento, como el neoplasticismo. Destacaba junto a la puerta de entrada una gran torre de madera de forma cónica, coronada por tres discos horizontales superpuestos; se la denominaba «Funkis», abreviatura en sueco de funcionalismo a comienzos del siglo . Tanto el edificio como la torre se desmontaron después de la Exposición y se reconstruyeron en Berga, donde el pabellón sirvió de escuela hasta la Guerra Civil, siendo derruido el conjunto a principios de la década de los años 1960. En la actualidad existe un proyecto para reconstruir la torre junto al Museo Olímpico, cerca de su ubicación original. 55 ​\n• Pabellón de Argelia, Tunicia y Marruecos: estos tres territorios magrebíes, entonces colonias francesas, se presentaron con un pabellón de estilo islámico, con un cuerpo central rematado por una cúpula y dos secciones laterales con arcadas, una de ellas con un minarete. Se encontraba entre la Fuente Mágica y el pabellón de Barcelona, frente al Palacio de Alfonso XIII. 56 ​\n• Pabellón de los Reinos Serbio, Croata y Esloveno\n• Pabellón de la Caja de Ahorros y Pensiones de Barcelona: situado en el Paseo de Santa Madrona, fue obra de Josep Maria Ribas i Casas y Manuel Maria Mayol. De estilo ecléctico, presenta soluciones estructurales basadas en diversos estilos: el cuerpo central se inspira en la arquitectura palaciega española del siglo , mientras que los laterales remiten a la arquitectura civil del norte de Italia y las logias evocan las villas mediterráneas de gusto novecentista. Debido a su situación elevada, en su acceso se situaron unas terrazas con fuentes luminosas. Desde 1982 es sede del Instituto Cartográfico de Cataluña. 26 ​\n• Pabellón de la Compañía General de Tabacos de Filipinas: situado en el Paseo de Santa Madrona, fue obra de Antoni Darder realizada en 1928. El edificio tiene planta en forma de U, rodeado de jardines, con una torre lateral y una cúpula octogonal sobre su cuerpo central. Darder siguió el estilo art déco de moda en los años 1920, con una inteligente distribución del espacio interior y un versátil juego de volúmenes en el exterior. En 1932 se convirtió en el Parvulario Municipal Forestier. 36 ​\n• Pabellón del Suministro de Electricidad de Alemania: obra de Ludwig Mies van der Rohe y Lilly Reich, se encontraba en la plaza de la Luz, entre los palacios de Comunicaciones y Transportes y del Arte Textil. Edificio de volumen único y planta rectangular, semejante a una nave industrial, pasó casi desapercibido durante el certamen, siendo una de las obras menos logradas de Mies y una de las últimas donde realizó muros de ladrillo, pasándose desde entonces al vidrio. 57 ​\n• Pabellón de Electric Supplies: se hallaba en la plaza del Universo. El edificio tenía planta de cruz griega y una fachada neoclásica con una serie de frontones escalonados. La compañía Electric Supplies Co. fue la encargada de la electrificación de todo el recinto de la Exposición. 58 ​\n• Can Jorba: la firma comercial Jorba se presentó con Can («casa de» en catalán) Jorba, pequeña estructura réplica de la Torre Eiffel de París, hecha con las letras de la marca patrocinadora —la J en lo alto y la A en la base de la torre—. 59 ​\n• Pabellón de la Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro: obra de Regino Borobio, fue uno de los pocos edificios españoles con un diseño vanguardista, presentando un edificio en forma de caja horizontal con una alta torre de señalización. 60 ​ El edificio estaba decorado con tres esculturas alegóricas de la energía hidráulica, la agricultura y la navegación, obra de Félix Burriel, mientras que en el interior se instalaron varios cuadros de pantanos y paisajes de la cuenca del Ebro, obra de Ángel Díaz Domínguez. 61 ​\n• Pabellón de Riegos y Energía de Valencia: la empresa REVA, fundada en 1928 para la construcción de embalses en la cuenca del río Turia, participó con un pequeño pabellón situado entre los del Banco Vitalicio y la Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro. 62 ​\n• Pabellón de la Compañía Hispano-Suiza: obra de Eusebi Bona, estaba situado en el mirador frente al Palacio Nacional. Era un edificio de estilo racionalista, con una alta torre coronada por una escultura de una cigüeña, que era el símbolo de la compañía automovilística española. 63 ​\n• Pabellón Nestlé-La Lechera: la compañía suiza Nestlé concurrió con un pabellón situado junto al palacio de Victoria Eugenia, detrás del pabellón de Alemania, un pequeño edificio de estilo art déco de forma cilíndrica flanqueado de dos torres rectangulares con la inscripción Nestlé en grandes letras. Incluía un cine al aire libre y unas figuras mecánicas que distraían al público. 64 ​\n• Pabellón de Rocalla S.A.: esta compañía de materiales de construcción presentó un pabellón formado por tres cuerpos escalonados y una alta torre coronada por una estatua ecuestre. 65 ​\n• Pabellón de Asland: esta fábrica de cementos participó con una torre de 50 m de altura de vidrio y hormigón, con un mirador y rematada por un faro giratorio. 66 ​\n• Pabellón de Uralita-Eternit-Zenit: estaba dedicado a varias empresas constructoras de estructuras de fibrocemento. Situado entre el Estadio Olímpico y el Palacio de las Misiones, tenía una estética vanguardista, con una base circular elevada del suelo de la que surgían tres altos tubos semejantes a chimeneas, que tenían escritos los nombres de las fábricas patrocinadoras. 67 ​\n• Pabellón de los exportadores españoles de aceite de oliva: se encontraba al lado del Palacio Nacional, y tenía forma de típica masía catalana. 68 ​\n• Pabellón del Banco Vitalicio de España: obra de Lluís Bonet i Garí, estaba situado junto al Palacio Nacional, y tenía un original diseño arquitectónico, con una decoración que semejaba palmeras tropicales, y una cúpula rematada por una estrella. 69 ​\n• Pabellón de la Constructora Naval: la Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval participó con una pabellón situado en la hoy desaparecida plaza de San Antonio, en la confluencia del paseo de Santa Madrona y la avenida del Estadio, obra de Eugenio Cendoya. En él se exponían diversos productos relacionados con la marina de guerra, la principal actividad de la empresa. El pabellón se mantuvo en pie pasada la Exposición y fue derribado probablemente en los años 1930. 70 ​\n• Pabellón de La Equitativa: se encontraba en la plaza del Universo, encuadrada en un conjunto de pequeños edificios que rodeaban la fuente monumental que había en la plaza, y representaba la compañía de seguros La Equitativa, filial de la estadounidense Equitable Life Assurance Society. Era de estilo art déco, de forma octogonal y rematado por una alta columna. 71 ​\n• Estand de Burmeister & Wain: esta empresa danesa de motores y maquinaria se mostró en la Exposición con un estand situado junto al palacio de Victoria Eugenia, con una base períptera sobre la que se situaba un cuerpo con forma de pirámide truncada, en el que se veía el emblema de la compañía, un drakkar vikingo navegando entre los rayos del sol. 72 ​\n• Pabellón Pirelli: la empresa italiana de neumáticos Pirelli participó en la Exposición con un pabellón propio, situado en la avenida de Montanyans, cerca del Palacio Nacional. Era obra del arquitecto Allodi, construida en estilo renacentista lombardo. 73 ​\n• Estand de Maggi: la empresa suiza de cubitos de caldo Maggi participó con un estand situado en la plaza de la Fuente Mágica. Obra del arquitecto J. Pujol, era un edificio de aspecto contemporáneo rematado en el tejado por unos grandes cubos en representación del producto estrella de la casa. 74 ​\n• Estand de Papel de fumar Bambú: esta empresa valenciana de papel de tabaco puso un estand en la plaza del Universo, tocando a la avenida de la Reina María Cristina. Era bastante llamativo, de forma cuadrangular y con el nombre de la empresa en letras grandes en el tejado. 75 ​\n• Pabellón de Perfumerías Gal: se encontraba junto al Palacio Nacional, cerca del pabellón del Reino de los Serbios, Croatas y Eslovenos. Obra del diseñador Federico Ribas y el arquitecto Vicente Sáenz Vallejo, era un edificio de estilo art déco, parecido al que la empresa presentó ese mismo año a la Exposición Iberoamericana de Sevilla. Tenía un piso de planta cuadrada sobre el que se erguía una torre de forma prismática cortada en su base por tres planos. Tanto las puertas como las paredes del piso bajo eran de vidrios de colores. 76 ​\n• Pabellón de la Compañía Hispano-Americana de Electricidad (CHADE): esta empresa fue constituida en 1920 por un holding internacional europeo y tenía una fuerte implantación en numerosos países sudamericanos, especialmente Argentina. Entre sus fundadores se encontraba el político Francesc Cambó. Su pabellón se encontraba en la explanada contigua al Palacio Nacional, al lado del pabellón de Pirelli. Era un edificio de estilo neoclásico, rematado por frontones y unos jarrones decorativos. 77 ​\n• Pabellón de la Cooperativa de Fluido Eléctrico (CFE): esta empresa catalana fundada en 1920 participó con un pabellón de estilo racionalista situado junto al anterior, cerca del Palacio Nacional. 78 ​\n• Pabellón de Brown Boveri / Sociedad Española de Electricidad: Brown Boveri era una compañía suiza fundada en 1891 que fabricaba material y componentes eléctricos. En España participó en la creación de la Compañía Española de Fluido Eléctrico y se vinculó con la Sociedad Española de Electricidad, con la que compartió pabellón. Situado frente al Pabellón de Barcelona, su arquitectura era tradicional, con cierta semejanza al Mercado de las Flores. 79 ​\n• Pabellón de Nitrato de Chile: esta compañía chilena de comercialización de salitre para fertilizante agrícola participó con un pabellón situado entre los palacios de las Artes Gráficas (actual Museo de Arqueología) y de la Caixa de Pensions, de estilo racionalista. 80 ​\n• Estand de Lithinés del Dr. Gustin: el agua de lithinés era una solución de carbonato de litio en polvo diluido en agua que se tomaba como remedio para diversas enfermedades relacionadas con la presencia de ácido úrico en el cuerpo, como reumatismo, gota o artritis. Con una patente del farmacéutico parisino Arthur Mille, la empresa que lo comercializaba se presentó con un estand de diseño racionalista, de pequeñas dimensiones, formado por una barra redonda con dos obeliscos de varios cuerpos decrecientes en altura, con una cubierta de vidrio y metal. Se encontraba en la avenida de Muntanyans, entre el Palacio de la Química y el Parque de Atracciones. 81 ​\n• Pabellón de las Maravillas del Mar de las Indias: estaba situado entre el Parque de Atracciones de la Foixarda y la plaza de San Jorge, y era un edificio rectangular de una nave, que en su interior contenía una colección de flora y fauna marina recopilada por Jacobus Hendrikus Soumokil, príncipe de Urumessing. 82 ​\n• Pabellón Souk Africano: pese a su nombre este pabellón no representaba a ningún país en concreto, sino que era el estand de un grupo de comerciantes de productos magrebíes, especialmente de Marruecos, Argelia y Tunicia, que por entonces aún eran colonias francesas. El pabellón era de estilo neomudéjar, con una galería de entrada de arcos de herradura y un minarete lateral rematado en cúpula. Se encontraba en la plaza de Europa, entre el pabellón de Dinamarca y el Restaurant Ambassadeurs. 83 ​\n• Quiosco-estand de Picon: la marca francesa de bebidas alcohólicas Picon concurrió al certamen con un quiosco con forma de templete de estilo árabe inspirado en la arquitectura argelina, país en el que se creó la marca en 1837. Estaba situado en uno de los extremos de una escalinata que unía el final de la avenida que partía del Estadio Olímpico, donde estaba situada la sección internacional, y la plaza con surtidores de agua situada frente al Restaurant Ambassadeurs. 84 ​\n• Estand de Café Gili: esta empresa instaló un pequeño estand en una explanada entre la Fuente Mágica y las cascadas, al lado del palacio de Victoria Eugenia. En el mismo se podían degustar los cafés de la marca Haití, que comercializaba la empresa Hijo de Jacinto Gili. Era un estand de pequeñas dimensiones pero de diseño moderno e innovador. 85 ​\n• Pabellón de los Artistas Reunidos: obra de Jaume Mestres i Fossas, su objetivo fue dar a conocer la obra de distintos artistas catalanes que no tenían representación en la Sección Oficial, por lo que concurrieron de forma privada. El edificio, de estilo art déco, tenía planta octogonal y cúpula escalonada, mientras que la distribución del espacio interior, así como su decoración, evocaban al racionalismo, una de las pocas muestras nacionales de tipología de vanguardia. Participaron artistas como Pablo Gargallo, Josep Granyer, Josep Llorens i Artigas, Lluís Mercadé, Josep de Togores, Josep Obiols, Miquel Soldevila, Jaume Mercadé, etc., exponiendo pintura, escultura, cerámica, muebles, joyas, esmaltes, alfombras y otros objetos artísticos, la mayoría englobados dentro del art déco. 86 ​\n• Pabellón de la Escuela Central de Anormales de Madrid: situado en un extremo de la explanada del Estadio Olímpico, en lo que hoy día es la plaza de Europa, este pabellón fue patrocinado por el Ministerio de Instrucción Pública con el objetivo de difundir la labor realizada por esta escuela dedicada a los discapacitados. Se trataba de un edificio inspirado en la arquitectura andaluza, que fue derribado tras la Exposición. 87 ​\n• Pabellón de Cartografía, conocido popularmente como Pabellón del Mapa de España: se encontraba entre el Palacio Nacional y el Pabellón de la Caja de Ahorros y Pensiones, y era un pequeño edificio de forma redonda coronado por un cupulín sobre columnas. En su interior había un mapa en relieve de España. Fue desmontado tras la Exposición. 88 ​\n• Pabellones de Beneficencia: en la esquina entre la calle de Lérida y la avenida del Paralelo se instalaron una serie de pequeños pabellones dedicados a beneficencia: atención a la infancia, ciegos, tribunal de menores, personas desvalidas, salud mental, etc. 89 ​\n• Granja de la Asociación General de Ganaderos del Reino: el gremio de ganaderos organizó una exposición en un recinto situado en una antigua cantera, entre el Palacio Nacional y el Estadio Olímpico, en el sector de la Foixarda, junto al antiguo jardín botánico. El edificio principal del recinto era una masía, en representación de la típica arquitectura rural catalana, alrededor de la cual había diversas construcciones menores donde se exhibía ganado y productos derivados del sector, como leche, huevos, quesos y mantecas. Pasada la Exposición se mantuvo la masía, que se encuentra actualmente rodeada de un jardín y es utilizada para actividades relacionadas con la jardinería. 90 ​\n• Pueblo Oriental: en la carretera del Estadio, al otro lado del Parque de Atracciones de la Foixarda —donde ahora se encuentra el INEFC—, se ubicó el Pueblo Oriental, un recinto análogo al del Pueblo Español pero dedicado a los países de Oriente, donde se mostraban productos típicos de estos países, desde la gastronomía hasta la artesanía. Estaban representados India, Persia, Turquía, Ceilán, Birmania, Egipto, Túnez, Hong-Kong, Palestina y Marruecos. Como elemento destacado cabe citar una reproducción del Santo Sepulcro ubicada en la sección de Palestina. 91 ​\n• Pabellón de la Confederación Hidrográfica del Ebro\n• Pabellón de los exportadores españoles de aceite de oliva\n• Pabellón de la Escuela Central de Anormales de Madrid\n\nEl ajardinamiento de la montaña de Montjuic dejó obras como el Teatro Griego, teatro al aire libre inspirado en los antiguos teatros griegos —especialmente en el de Epidauro—, proyectado por Ramon Reventós. Situado en el espacio de una antigua cantera, tiene un hemiciclo de 460 m², con un diámetro de 70 m y capacidad para 2000 personas.[92]​ Actualmente es sede de un festival de verano en la ciudad condal, el Festival Grec.\n\nEl teatro se sitúa en los Jardines de Laribal, proyectados por Forestier y Rubió, donde destaca la famosa Fuente del Gato, a la entrada de un edificio de Puig i Cadafalch convertido en restaurante (1925). En los jardines se colocaron multitud de esculturas, con obras de Josep Viladomat, Enric Casanovas, Josep Clarà, Pablo Gargallo, Antoni Alsina, Joan Rebull, Josep Dunyach, etc.\n\nFuera ya del recinto, en la zona de Miramar, se construyó un restaurante que en 1959 se convertiría en los primeros estudios de Televisión Española en Barcelona.[93]​\n\nEn lo alto de la montaña, junto a la Sección Internacional, se construyó el Estadio Olímpico, dentro de la sección dedicada a deportes, obra de Pere Domènech i Roura. Tenía una superficie de 66 075 m² y una capacidad para 62 000 personas, siendo en su día el segundo estadio más grande de Europa, detrás del de Wembley. Disponía de campos para la práctica del fútbol y otros deportes, junto a las pistas dedicadas al atletismo e instalaciones para diversos deportes como boxeo, gimnasia o esgrima, así como pista de tenis y piscina. La fachada principal era de aire monumental, con una cúpula y una alta torre rematada por un templete. Se realizó una decoración escultórica donde destacaban los Jinetes haciendo el saludo olímpico, dos esculturas ecuestres en bronce de Pablo Gargallo. El edificio fue remodelado por los arquitectos Vittorio Gregotti, Federico Correa, Alfons Milà, Joan Margarit y Carles Buxadé para los Juegos Olímpicos de Barcelona 1992.[94]​\n\nNo lejos del Estadio, en la avenida Miramar, se construyó la Piscina Municipal de Montjuic, aún en activo tras una reconstrucción integral sufrida con ocasión de los Juegos Olímpicos de Barcelona 1992.\n\nUna obra que tuvo mucho éxito de público fue el Pueblo Español, pequeño recinto que recoge en su interior reproducciones de distintos ambientes urbanos y arquitectónicos de todo el conjunto del territorio nacional, en un ambiente que va desde la evocación folklórica hasta la más estricta recreación arqueológica. Obra de los arquitectos Ramon Reventós y Francesc Folguera, contó con el asesoramiento artístico de Miquel Utrillo y Xavier Nogués. El recinto está dividido en seis áreas regionales: castellano-extremeña, vasco-navarra, catalán-valenciana-balear, andaluza, aragonesa y gallega, en torno a una plaza Mayor y rodeado por una muralla (réplica de la de Ávila). Con una superficie de 20 000 m², cuenta con unos 600 edificios, de los cuales 200 pueden visitarse. Entre los monumentos reproducidos destacan el campanario mudéjar de Utebo (Zaragoza), los palacios del marqués de Peñaflor (Sevilla) y de Ovando Solís (Cáceres), el claustro de Sant Benet de Bages y el campanario románico de Taradell.[95]​\n\nJunto al Pueblo Español se construyeron unas pistas de tenis de tierra batida y un chalet-sede social, en las que se celebraron diversas actividades deportivas durante el certamen. Acabado el mismo, dichas pistas acogieron una eliminatoria de Copa Davis entre España y Japón en 1930 y una fase final de la Copa de España de baloncesto en 1935. En 1951 se trasladó a las instalaciones la Real Sociedad de Tenis Pompeya, que las viene utilizando hasta la actualidad.\n\nPara la Exposición se instaló también un parque de atracciones en los terrenos de La Foixarda, detrás del Pueblo Español. Contaba con una montaña rusa, un tren de vapor que hacía un recorrido de 2 km hasta el Palacio Nacional, un tiovivo, barracas de feria y diversas atracciones menores.[96]​ Este parque fue desmontado tras la Exposición, pero debido a su éxito surgió la iniciativa de instalar otro permanente en su lugar. El nuevo parque, inaugurado el 14 de julio de 1930, recibió el nombre de Maricel, y estaba situado entre Miramar y la estación del funicular, con acceso por la plaza de Dante. Tenía unas diez atracciones, entre las que destacaba una montaña rusa llamada Bug, así como una pista de patinaje y diversos juegos, como la Carioca, la Ninfa, el Cupido o el Mono de la Suerte. ​ También se celebraban espectáculos y eventos deportivos. El parque incluía un restaurante, regentado por el Hotel Oriente. Cerró sus puertas en 1936, al inicio de la Guerra Civil. Este parque fue un precedente del parque de atracciones de Montjuïc inaugurado en 1966.[98]​\n\nComo ocurrió en 1888, la Exposición de 1929 supuso un gran impacto para la ciudad de Barcelona a nivel urbanístico, no solo en la zona de Montjuic, ya que por toda la ciudad se realizaron obras de mejora y acondicionamiento: se ajardinaron las plazas de Tetuán, Urquinaona y Letamendi; se construyó el puente de Marina; se urbanizó la plaza de Cataluña; y se prolongaron la avenida Diagonal hacia el oeste y la Gran Vía de las Cortes Catalanas hacia el suroeste. También se realizaron diversas obras públicas: se mejoró el asfaltado de calles y el alcantarillado, se instalaron lavabos públicos y se sustituyó la iluminación de gas por la eléctrica.\n\nAsimismo, se remodelaron diversos edificios, como el Ayuntamiento —donde Josep Maria Sert pintó el Salón de Crónicas—, la Generalidad —donde se construyó el puente flamígero que cruza la calle Obispo— o el edificio de la Capitanía General de Cataluña. Se terminaron el edificio de Correos y la Estación de Francia, que llevaban varios años en obras. Asimismo, se construyó el Palacio Real de Pedralbes como residencia de la familia real, obra de Eusebi Bona y Francesc Nebot. Durante esa época se construyó asimismo el primer rascacielos de Barcelona, el edificio de Telefónica en la esquina Fontanella/Portal del Ángel, obra de Francesc Nebot.\n\nPor último, se mejoraron las comunicaciones de la ciudad, con la construcción en los años 1920 del aeropuerto del Prat, la supresión de los pasos a nivel dentro de la ciudad, la mejora de los enlaces con los barrios periféricos de la ciudad, el soterramiento del «tren de Sarrià» (Ferrocarriles de la Generalidad de Cataluña), la electrificación de los tranvías públicos y la ampliación de la línea 1 del Metro hasta Sants, conectando en plaza de España con el recinto de la Exposición. Todas estas obras públicas comportaron una fuerte demanda de empleo, provocando un gran aumento de la inmigración hacia la ciudad condal, proveniente de todas partes de España. Asimismo, el aumento de población conllevó la construcción de diversos barrios obreros de \"casas baratas\", como el Grupo Aunós en Montjuic y los Grupos Milans del Bosch y Baró de Viver en Besós.[99]​\n\nLos Exploradores de España organizaron un jamboree que se celebró en Montjuic del 21 de agosto al 3 de septiembre, con participación de boy scouts españoles y extranjeros, para aprovechar el impacto cultural que suponía la Exposición Internacional en aquel momento. La participación sumó un total de 2000 muchachos procedentes de 14 países.[100]​[101]​ La gran mayoría de las delegaciones participaron en el Jamboree Mundial celebrado un mes antes en Birkenhead, Inglaterra.[102]​ Los jefes de los contingentes nacionales fueron agasajados con un lunch ofrecido por el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona durante su visita a la casa consistorial.[103]​\n• Dictadura de Primo de Rivera en Cataluña\n• Esculturas de la Plaza de Cataluña\n• None Enciclopèdia de Barcelona 3.

The beauty and colour of the buildings don't eclipse the main protagonist of the ensemble: the giant mythological dragon from the Garden of the Hesperides, a synthesis of Gaudí's symbolism and craftsmanship.\n\nEusebi Güell's desire to extend his family's holiday home in Barcelona resulted in Antoni Gaudí's first commission from the man who would become his main patron. Gaudí worked on the project from 1884 to 1887, relandscaping the garden and building the two gatehouses, which were intended to be the caretaker's house and the stables. The perfect synthesis of innovation and decorative craftsmanship comes to life in both buildings and the magnificent wrought-iron gate in the shape of a dragon, that connects them.\n\nGüell Estate's gatehouses have a stone base and brick parabolic arches with bright ceramic decorations in geometric shapes. On one side of the gate, a turret, crowned by plant motifs, features a medallion bearing the initial of the owner of the estate. And, in the centre, the dragon on the gate spreads its menacing bat-like wings, its forked tongue visible in its gaping maws. It represents the mythical dragon from the Garden of the Hesperides, which commemorates Hercules' daring feat which was captured so skilfully by the Catalan renaixentista poet Jacint Verdaguer in his epic work L'Atlàntida."}

El guion, escrito por el director y por su hermano mayor Gaston Méliès, inspirada en una amplia variedad de fuentes entre las que destacan De la Tierra a la Luna, de Julio Verne, y Los primeros hombres en la Luna, de H. G. Wells. La película dura 14 minutos con 12 segundos si se proyecta a una velocidad de 16 fotogramas por segundo, y algo más de ocho proyectada a 25 f/s. Narra la aventura de un grupo de astrónomos que viaja a la Luna en una cápsula impulsada por cañones, explora la superficie del satélite, escapa de un grupo subterráneo de selenitas (habitantes lunares) y regresa a la Tierra con un selenita cautivo.\n\nLa película, con un costo de 10 000 francos de la época, revolucionó el cine debido a su longitud inusual, sus lujosos valores de producción, sus efectos especiales innovadores y su énfasis en la narración de historias que influyeron notablemente en otros cineastas y, en última instancia, en el desarrollo de la película narrativa en su conjunto. El cine empezó a realizar historias ficcionadas tras su éxito, abandonando un tipo de cine más cercado al documental de los hermanos Lumiére. Para la posterioridad quedó la imagen de la cara de la Luna recibiendo el impacto de un cohete espacial disparado por una bala de cañón como uno de los planos más conocidos de la historia del cine.\n\nLa película es calificada como el primer éxito mundial en taquilla, si bien su creador no se benefició del éxito en algunos lugares como en el caso de en Estados Unidos, pero técnicos que trabajaban para Thomas Alva Edison lograron piratear las copias del filme y las distribuyeron por todo el país. Esto motivaría a Georges Méliès a hacer dos copias diferentes en sucesivas cintas. Le Voyage dans la Lune sigue siendo una película muy popular actualmente y se ha comercializado en formato doméstico, bien incluida dentro de packs o con diferentes versiones de la misma (blanco y negro, pintada a color o narrada). También se han hecho exposiciones en museos o proyecciones especiales de la película.\n\nLa crítica de cine contemporánea la reconoce como la más importante de las creaciones cinematográficas de Méliès. Es, por ello, que ha aparecido en algunas listas de las mejores películas o las más importantes de la historia del cine. Además, es, en cierto modo, el primer filme de ciencia ficción de la historia del cine. También ha sido motivo de estudio por varios historiadores del cine o analistas, además de varios documentales, incluso sobre sus restauraciones como El viaje extraordinario.\n\nEsto se dio por perdida, ya que el propio Méliès decidió destruirla en un ataque de ira una vez retirado de la industria cinematográfica que le había olvidado, pero luego fue redescubierta alrededor de 1930, cuando la importancia de Méliès en la historia del cine comenzó a ser reconocida por los devotos de la película y varios directores en activo. Sin embargo, no fue descubierta una copia completa hasta los años 1990. Posteriormente, una impresión original coloreada a mano fue descubierta en 1993 y restaurada completamente en 2011 tras un laborioso trabajo que fue más \"una reconstrucción o resurrección que una restauración\" en palabras de uno de los involucrados.[1]​\n\nLa película está formada por varias escenas con plano fijo con una sola acción espacial en las que se van sucediendo una serie de trucos visuales.[2]​ Ante la cámara aparecen una serie de personajes que se mueven dentro del escenario con la cámara inmóvil, incluso los escenarios los que se acercan o se alejan hacia ella. Los personajes también desfilan de un escenario a otro y se unen por fundidos o cortes directos La película carece de títulos explicativos.[3]​ Por ello, la productora, Star Film, envió folletos explicativos para que los relatores explicaran lo que estaba sucediendo en las escenas.[4]​\n\nEn una sala de conferencia de científicos Incoherente, una veintena de asistentes esperan la llegada del profesor Barbenfouillis (Barbarrevuelta en castellano). Algunos de los asistentes se muestran inquietos, destaca un hombre barbudo con un abrigo color rojo anaranjado que se encuentra separado del resto de asistentes. En ese momento entra el gabinete de científicos, tras ser presentados por una auxiliar, formado por Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, Parafaragaramus y un sexto miembro que viste una abrigo rojo que se posiciona en medio del hemiciclo. Tras ellos, vienen seis edecanas que sostienen un telescopio dorado cada una y le los entregan mano los miembros del gabinete y se marchan por la otra puerta. Mientras salen ellas, entra por la puerta principal Barbenfouillis vestido con un abrigo oscuro con topos dorado entre aplausos de los asistentes, menos por el hombre del abrigo rojo anaranjado que se queda sentando con los brazos cruzados.\n\nBarbenfouillis ruega a los asistentes que se sienten. En ese momento, los telescopios de los miembros del gabinete se convierten en taburetes. El astrónomo explica usando la pizarra su proyecto, viajar a la luna mediante un nave propulsado por un cañón. Tanto los asistentes como el gabinete aplauden la idea a excepción del hombre del abrigo rojo anaranjado que se levanta del sitio y empieza a recriminar a Barbenfouillis. Un miembro del gabinete sujeta al hombre del abrigo rojo anaranjado mientras en increpado por los demás asistentes y Barbenfouillis le lanza papeles a la cara. El hombre del abrigo rojo anaranjado vuelve a su sitio enfadado y aparecen, de nuevo, las seis edecanas portando trajes para los seis miembros de la expedición. Tras cambiarse de ropa en la misma sala, Barbenfouillis llama al resto del grupo de la expedición para que le acompañen y salen por la puerta principal.\n\nCambiamos de escenario, ahora nos encontramos en el taller donde se está construyendo el cohete. En el taller encontramos tres herreros, 4 mecánicos para la nave y un carpintero. Los seis astrónomos entran en el taller y entran dentro de la nave y observan maravillados los resultados de la misma. En un momento, Micromegas[4]​ cae al suelo al chocarse con el carpintero. Tras el incidente, Barbenfouillis avisa a los científicos y se los lleva para enseñarles las vistas desde la azotea. Los científicos observan las pruebas del cohete y, a lo lejos, la ciudad (se entiende que París). En un determinado momento, una bandera blanca aparece al fondo de la imagen como muestra del inicio de las pruebas de fundición. Los científicos se pelean por tener una mejor vista del momento, uno de ellos utiliza un telescopio, y aparece una llamarada desde un hueco lo que lleva a la exaltación como muestra de que la prueba ha sido un éxito.\n\nTiempo después se producen el embarque de la nave, un soldado comprueba el interior del propulsor, y se coloca en una plataforma rodeada de unas auxiliares vestidas de rosa. El agente mira hacia abajo y observa que los científicos están subiendo hacia la plataforma así que ordena que se preparen para el despegue. Los científicos llevan unos trajes distintos y portan, además, paraguas. Se van despidiendo a lo lejos de la multitud y de las personas que han trabajado en el proyecto. Se introducen en la nave y un grupo de auxiliares vestidas con ropa veraniega color turquesa y gorros amarillos empujan la nave hasta introducirla dentro del cañón para, posteriormente, despedir al público sosteniendo sus gorros.\n\nEl guardia se encuentra en el momento del despegue, el soldado se dirige al lugar del lanzamiento y recibe el saludo del encargado de ejecutar el disparo. El soldado desenvaina el sable y hace una señal con el mismo lo que hace que todas las edecanesse acercan al lugar en donde observamos los picos de las montañas, las nubes y la luna al fondo. Tres de ellas se pondrán en primera final, las dos de los extremos portan las trompetas y, la del medio, una bandera. Mientras tanto el lanzado se ha colocado encima de una escalera a la espera de la orden de lanzamiento. Tras tocar las trompetas, las tres auxiliares se darán un paso atrás para unirse al resto y el militar hace la señal del despegue. Una vez producido una multitud de civiles se acerca al cañón para darle la despedida.\n\nObservamos la luna de color amarillo, rodeada de nubes y el cielo oscuro, que va haciéndose más grande y distinguimos una mayor forma de cara conforme se acerca la nave a ella. La nave impacta en el ojo derecho y embarrando los alrededores con un color rojo (el mismo del color de la nave) como si fuese un pastel. Tras el imparta la luna se pone triste ya que le ha dolido el impacto de la nave. La nave aluniza encontrándose en una superficie rocosa, uno a uno los astrónomos salen de la cápsula y ven que la nave ha colisionado. Aterrizando con seguridad en el satélite, los exploradores salen de la cápsula y van observando y miran la gran distancia entre la Tierra y el territorio en el que se hallan, exhaustos por el largo viaje, estos desenrollan sus frazadas y duermen. Mientras duermen, un cometa pasa y la Osa Mayor aparece, cada estrella posee una cara humana, el viejo Saturno se inclina fuera de una ventana en su planeta anillado y Febe, diosa de la Luna, aparece sentada en un oscilación de una Luna creciente.\n\nFebe provoca una gran tormenta de nieve, que obliga a los astrónomos a buscar refugio y calor. Los protagonistas encuentran una cueva subterránea donde se pueden cobijar. Los científicos se encuentran dentro de una caverna con setas de muy diversos tamaños y tipos, lo cual hace que los científicos vayan observándolas lentamente, señalándolas y hablando sobre ellas. Barbenfouillis se aleja del resto de la expedición y les señala una seta, abre su paraguas, toma la raíz de una de ellas y se transforma en una seta gigante. Barbenfouillis, sorprendido, opta por alejarse de la seta y unirse al resto del grupo. De pronto, un selenita (habitante de la Luna) aparece, Barbenfouillis, decide asesinarle. Otro selenita, en solitario, también aparece y el jefe de la expedición opta por hacer lo mismo que con el anterior. Esto provoca la llegada de un gran número de colonos lunares que desean por lo que las dos muertes de sus compatriotas, por lo que astrónomos que se ven obligados a rendirse\n\nLos astrónomos son apresados y llevados a la fortaleza del líder de la tribu custodiados por el ejército. El líder está sentado en un trono con estrellas con forma humana como sirvientes. Éste ordena que los terrícolas entren y les juzga por los asesinatos de sus compatriotas. Los científicos, a pesar de estar maniatados, se siguen resistiendo al ejército selenita. En un instante, Barbenfouillis consigue quitarse las ataduras y asesina al líder con el paraguas. Esto provoca un revuelo y, tras conseguir los otros cinco tripulantes quitarse las ataduras escapan de la fortaleza.\n\nEl ejército selenita los persigue en la corteza lunar. Barbenfouillis ordena al resto de los tripulantes que sigan hacia la nave, mientras que él se queda más resguardado intentando contener al ejército selenita usando el paraguas como escudo Eso provoca la huida de los científicos y persecución por los soldados selenitas. Durante la contención, el líder de la expedición asesinará a varios selenitas. Sin embargo, el ejércitos tiene muchos soldados acaba huyendo hacia la nave.\n\nEl resto de científicos ya han llegado a la nave pero esperan a que el líder de la expedición también lo haga. Uno de los tripulantes deja la puerta abierta y observa lo que va ocurriendo en el exterior. Barbenfouillis les dice que no va a entrar en la nave porque lo que cierran la puerta. Tras eso, el líder de la expedición salta y que se sujeta a una cuerda está unida a la nave para no caer al abismo. Uno de los selenitas, que los persigue, consigue agarrarse a la nave, mientras que el resto no son capaces de agarrarse a ello sino que la empujan. Mientras la nave se aleja, los selenitas alzan las lanzas en señal de decepción y enfado por no poder apresarlos.\n\nLa nave cae hacia un océano de la Tierra con Barbenfouillis y el selenita agarrados a la misma. Tras alcanzar el fondo del mar, con numerosas especies en el mismo, la cápsula flota de nuevo a la superficie. Allí la nave es remolcada por un barco de vapor que los lleva sanos y salvo al puerto. A su llegada, encontrarán un desfile en su honor con una multitud de personas esperándoles. Primero la nave es la que desfila y, posteriormente, aparecen los seis astronómos recibiendo un baño de masas. Al final del desfile, el organizador les entrega, a cada uno, una medalla con forma de luna. Más tarde aparece el selenita aparece en medio del festejo y se muestra amaestrado, sometido por una cuerda en su cuello para luego mostrar una estatua donde un astrónomo pisa la cara de la Luna con el cohete incrustado en su ojo mientras se realiza un desfile. En la estatua se encuentra el inscripción la frase latina Labor omnia vincit (El trabajo lo conquista todo) y la palabra ciencia en francés rodeada de una corona de laurel dorada.\n\nMéliès tuvo problemas con la selección del reparto, ya que en aquel momento los actores teatrales no quisieron participar en el cine al entenderlo un género menor.[3]​ El reparto no está acreditado ya que la inclusión de los títulos de créditos, tanto al inicio como al final, no fue desarrollado sino hasta unos años más tarde.[5]​ Parte del reparto se ha descubierto gracias a historiadores a través de declaraciones del propio Méliès.\n\nMéliès, tras idear las escenas la tarde anterior explicaba lo que iban a realizar a intérpretes y técnicos. La jornada empezaba a las 8 de la mañana cuando Méliès hablaba con los distintos intérpretes. En un principio era trabajadores del teatro Robert-Houdin, jardineros de la finca o servicio doméstico; luego contrató a trabajadores de ballet y bailarinas del Chatelet. Aunque no hubiese sonido hasta 25 años después, los actores hablan en sus películas para dar una mayor verosimilitud a la interpretación.[6]​\n\nLa interpretaciones se basan en la mímica y la expresión exagerada ya que, según el historiador Roman Gubern, \"Mèliés no ha comprendido, y el cine tardará años en comprenderlo, que la lejanía de las localidades no modifica sensiblemente la percepción del espectador\".[7]​ Según el director Michel Hazanavicius, entre lo más destacable de las películas es que resulta evidente que el reparto está disfrutando realizando la película. El ejemplo lo pone la escena inicial, en el Congreso de científicos, donde parece que se encuentran en una fiesta de fin de año.[8]​\n\nMélies interpreta al profesor Barbenfouillis, astrónomo que lidera la expedición lunar. El francés actuó en, al menos, 300 de sus 520 películas.[9]​ Según el propio director, él se vio forzado a protagonizar sus películas porque era el único que podía comprender la dificultad de las mismas.[9]​\n\nD'Alcy interpreta el papel de la secretaria. Ella fue la musa y la segunda esposa de Méliès y calificada como la primera estrella del cine.[10]​ La primera participación de d'Alcy en una película fue en La mansión del diablo.[11]​ Méliès ya había trabajado con d'Alcy en el teatro, el director francés, puesto que su pequeño tamaño permitía utilizarla para los trucos de escamoteo, además de su encanto y vivacidad.[6]​ En 1925 Méliès se casó en segundas nupcias con d'Alcy.[6]​\n\nLegris interpreta a líder del desfile en las dos escenas finales.[12]​ Legris, amigo y compañero de Méliès, fue la \"varita mágica\" del teatro Robert-Houdin durante 14 años y participó en varias películas del director francés.[12]​[6]​ El historiador Soudol determinó que la primera aparición de Legris fue en La mansión del diablo.[13]​[12]​\n\nBernon interpreta a Febe, la dama en la Luna. Bernon fue descubierta por Méliès en los años 1890 cuando fue cantante en el cabaret de L'Enfer.[14]​\n\nLos cinco astrónomos que acompañan al profesor Barbenfouilis fueron interpretados por Victor André, Brunnet, Depierre, Farjaut y Kelm.[3]​ Los nombres son Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas y Parafaragaramus nos indican el tono satírico de la película,[4]​ ya que son parodias o nombres humorísticos relacionados con la ciencia. Henri Delannoy interpretó al capitán de la nave espacial y François Lallement al oficial de los marines.\n\nEl 28 de diciembre de 1895, los hermanos Lumiere organizaron una proyección en el Salón Indio del Grand Café donde se estrenó, entre otras Salida de los obreros de la fábrica o El regador regado. George Méliès fue uno de los múltiples asistentes a dicha proyección y se interesó en adquirir el cinematógrafo. Los Lumiere, como con el resto de ofertas de compra de aquella noche, la rechazaron. Ellos entendieron que no iba a tener mucho éxito en el futuro su invento. Según comentó el propió Mèliés en 1937, tuvo una charla con Antonio, padre de los hermanos Lumiere, quien le indicó que se trataba de un invento científico destinado a la medicina para estudiar los músculos y no para hacer proyecciones públicas. En futuras reuniones entre George y Antonione, el propio Lumiere le indicó que, al no ser un hombre de teatro, no había previsto otro uso.[6]​\n\nMéliès no cesó en su empeñó y acabó por conseguir una versión beta de Robert W. Paul por 1000 francos al que añadiría mejoras, junto a su amigo Lucien Reulos, su posterior operador de cámara, y el mecánico del teatro Robert-Houdin Lucien Korsten.[15]​ El parisino acomodó su teatro Robert Houdini, que adquirió en 1888, para que pudiesen proyectar sus filmaciones para la primavera de 1896. En este año llegó su mayor aportación al cine el stop trick rodando un documental en la ópera de París. Este descubrimiento hizo que, en los años siguientes, estrenó numerosos cortos de ficción en los que creó nuevos trucos cinematográficos. Todos ellos los cristalizó en su obra más conocida, Viaje a la Luna.[16]​\n\nEl propio Méliès, en 1930, dijo que sus principales influencias para la película fueron las novelas De la Tierra a la Luna y, su secuela, Alrededor de la Luna. Sin embargo, sus inicios como ilusionista influyeron a la hora de que no dijese sus trucos o fuentes de inspiración al contradecir la magia.[4]​ Es, por ello que, a medidos del siglo XX, historiadores cinematográficos como George Saudol, pusieron como otra influencia Los primeros hombres en la Luna de H.G. Wells, ya que se publicó una traducción francesa pocos meses antes de que Méliès hiciese la película. El propio Saudol argumenta que la parte previa al lanzamiento del cohete bebe de las novelas de Julio Verne, mientras que las aventuras de los científicos en la Luna lo hace de Wells.[17]​ Esto se debe a que se acerca más al género fantástico de Wells que al aventurero de Verne.[16]​ Por otro lado, Alejandro Mendoza, argumenta que Méliès se inspiró en la literatura más clásica, ya que adaptó a Goethe, Shakespeare o la Grecia clásica.[4]​\n\nAdemás de las referencias literarias, varios académicos de cine sugieren que Méliès se inspiró en otros medios, entre ellas destacarían la opereta Le voyage dans la lune de Jacques Offenbach y la atracción A Trip to the Moon de la Exposición Panamericana de 1901.[18]​[19]​ El historiador fílmico francés Thierry Lefebvre señala que la estructura narrativa de la película-viaje a la luna, alunizaje, encuentro con extraterrestres con malformaciones, una excursión subterránea, la entrevista con El hombre de la luna, un brutal regreso a la realidad en la Tierra- procedente de la atracción de 1901, mientras que ciertos elementos narrativos proceden de la obra de Offenbach tales como seis astrónomos con nombres pseudocientíficos, telescopios que se convierten en bancos, una tormenta de nieve en la superficie lunar o la escena de la salida de la Tierra.[20]​\n\nViaje a la luna la película más larga en aquel tiempo; tanto el presupuesto como duración de rodaje fueron inusualmente fastuosos, costando ₣10 000, para hacerse y tomando tres meses para el rodaje. Los camarógrafos fueron Théophile Michault y Lucien Tainguy, que trabajaron con Méliès como asalariados de la compañía de películas Star. Además de su labor como camarógrafos, los operadores de Méliès también hicieron trabajos para la compañía, tales como el desarrollo de la película y ayudando a establecer el escenario, y otro operador asalariado, François Lallement, apareció en la pantalla como el oficial de la Marina. Por el contrario, Méliès contrató a sus actores para la película, siendo personas talentosas en el mundo teatral parisiense, con quien él tenía muchas conexiones.\n\nEn sus primeras películas Méliès rodaba en el exterior, sin embargo, las situaciones climatológicas que se encontró en estas películas le hicieron construir un estudio cinematográfico, el primero en la historia destinado a las películas cinematográficas.[6]​ El estudio de cine de Méliès fue edificado en Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis en 1897; éste fue un invernadero, un edificio de 17 metros de largos por 6 de ancho (dimisiones similares al teatro Robert-Houdin) con paredes y techo de cristal para permitir más luz del sol como sea posible, un concepto utilizado por estudios fotográficos más aún desde la década de 1860 en adelante.[3]​ En sus inicios era solo una nave de vidrio y fue transformándose y perfeccionándose hasta el año 1900, llegando a disponer de cristales esmerilados y corrientes con faldillas que se abrían y cerraban automáticamente para evitar que hubiese sombras en verano. En 1898, Méliès ordenó excavar un foso bajo el escenario donde se encontraban trampillas, poleas, mecanismos de elevación y descenso que permitían cambiar de escenarios o provocar las apariciones y desapariciones de los personajes. En 1899 se construyeron pasarelas de cristal con suelo metálico para que los maquinistas pudieran accionar para provocar el vuelo de los carros, ángeles, las hadas o el paso de los nadadores. Por otro lado, las escenas submarinas rodaba a los actores a través de un acuario con peces vivos en su interior. En el extremo norte se situaba un escenario al mismo nivel del suelo de madera del taller de tal forma que recibiese luz natural,[6]​ ya que no sería hasta 1906 que podría utilizar la luz artificial en el estudio.[3]​ A principios de 1900, se prolongó el estudio con la construcción de un cobertizo en el lado sur, allí se encontraba una sala donde el operador podía manipular la filmación a oscuras; también permitía retrasar la cámara y ampliar el campo de filmación.[6]​ Al este, junto al estudio, se encontraba una nave que se utilizaba para los trabajos de pintura y carpintería de los escenarios, también estaba el almacén donde guardar los escenarios ya utilizados para futuras representaciones.[6]​ También disponía el escenario del estudio de puertas una enfrente de la otra que permitía que, cuando había una multitud de intérpretes en una escena y pudieran salir a un cortejo de guardarse siendo muy patente en el desfile de la película Juana de Arco de 1900.[6]​\n\nA lo largo de su carrera cinematográfica, Méliès trabajó con un estricto programa de planificación de películas, exigiendo a sus trabajadores puntualidad absoluta a las 8 de la mañana.[21]​ Antes del empezar la producción de las películas, Méliès preparaba las películas la tarde anterior en el teatro Robert-Houdin a través de una serie de croquis y, muy excepcionalmente, incluía algún texto o notas técnicas.[6]​ Así, cuando llega al estudio para empezar a rodar la película ya está todo en su cabeza sin saber, aún sin saber el resto del equipo nada sobre la cinta. Por lo que el propio director construye los decorados y los pinta de gris. Posteriormente, comprueba que todos los accesorios, máquinas y cámara funcionen correctamente y, una vez está todo a punto, llama a los artistas y figurantes y proceden a vestirse y maquillarse.[6]​ Posteriormente, como solía hacer en el teatro, Méliès explicaba la historia y se ensayaba empezando primero la parte principal y, después, las secundarias. El propio Méliès interpretaba a todos los personajes en los ensayos para explicar los gestos, las entradas y salidas y el lugar que el personaje debía ocupar en el escenario.[6]​ El rodaje de la película se realizaba siempre entre las 11 de la mañana hasta las 3 de la tarde, puesto que eran las horas más brillantes del día; los actores, a pesar de no ser cine mudo, hablaban como si fuera una representación teatral para dar mayor credibilidad a la actuación, mientras Méliès utiliza un piano o metrónomo mientras actúan para darle un mayor ritmo a la cinta.[6]​ Al final de la tarde, Méliès atiende el laboratorio de cine situado en El paisaje de la ópera donde realiza el revelado y montaje de las películas. Cerca del laboratorio se situaba el Théâtre Robert-Houdin, al que se dirigía después de una cena rápida para supervisar la buena marcha de la representación teatral. Por la tarde, asiste a representaciones en teatros parisinos por la tarde.[21]​ En múltiples ocasiones, y siempre a partir de las 6 de tarde, Méliès quedaba con otras personas, principalmente feriantes en su oficina en El pasaje de la ópera que se situaba cerca del teatro Robert-Houdin.[6]​\n\nSegún recuerdos de Méliès, gran parte del costo inusual de \"Un viaje a la luna\" fue debido al accionamiento mecánico y los trajes de los habitantes lunares, que fueron hechas para la película usando cartón y lona. Méliès por sí mismo ha esculpido los prototipos para la rótula piezas en terracota, cabezas y pies y luego creó moldes de yeso para ellos; un especialista en la fabricación de la máscara utilizó estos moldes para producir versiones de cartón para los actores. Uno de los telones de fondo para la película, mostrando el interior del taller en el cual se construye la cápsula espacial, con techo de cristal, fue pintado para parecerse al Real Studio con dicho techo en el cual se hizo la película.\n\nMuchos de los efectos especiales en un Viaje a la luna, como en muchas otras películas de Méliès, eran mediante la técnica del corte y salto, en el cual el operador de cámara dejaba de filmar lo suficiente para que algo en la pantalla pueda ser modificado, añadido o quitado. Méliès cuidadosamente dejó enlazados los fotogramas resultantes para crear efectos aparentemente mágicos, como la transformación de los telescopios de los astrónomos en butacas o la desaparición de los selenitas que explotan en bocanadas de humo. El uso de efectos especiales en la película dice Barbara Creed, era \"presentar el viaje a la luna como pura fantasía en lugar de un evento científico\".[22]​\n\nSegún el propio Méliès, la parte que más problemas le ofrecía en la realización de sus películas eran los efectos especiales.[6]​ En varias ocasiones Méliès hacía uso de la cámara vertical, permitiéndole hacer planos picados sobre el escenario tumbado, lo que permitía a los personajes hacer acrobacias inverosímiles.[6]​\n\nLa secuencia en que la cápsula llega para penetrar el ojo de la luna fue lograda mediante un efecto que George Méliès había inventado el año anterior para la película del hombre con la cabeza de goma. En lugar de intentar mover su cámara pesado hacia el actor, puso una silla sobre una rampa, con el actor (cubierto hasta el cuello de terciopelo negro) en la silla, la polea de accionamiento y lo tiró hacia la cámara. Además de su viabilidad técnica, esta técnica permitió también a Méliès controlar la colocación de la cara en el marco de un mayor grado de especificidad que mueva su cámara como le sea permitida. Un empalme como sustitución permitió a la cápsula aparecer de repente en el ojo del actor que interpreta a la luna, completando el disparo.\n\nOtra secuencia notable en la película fue el aterrizaje de la cápsula grabado en un mar de verdad, dicha caída fue editada con múltiples exposiciones delante de un fondo negro superpuesto sobre las imágenes del mar. El tiro es seguido por una visión submarina de la cápsula flotando en la superficie, creado mediante la combinación de un movimiento de recorte de cartón de la cápsula con un acuario que contiene los renacuajos y chorros de aire. El descenso del cohete desde la luna estaba cubierto de cuatro disparos, ocupando sólo unos veinte segundos de tiempo de la película.[23]​\n\nEn 1897 Méliès empezó su relación profesional con Elisabeth Thuillier en la película La mansión del diablo.[24]​ Thuillier, antigua colorista de cristal y productos de celuloide, un laboratorio con dos centenares de trabajadoras que pintaron con pincel sobre los negativos de la película con los colores que Thuillier eligió y especificó.[25]​ Se calcula que, al menos, la 4 % de la obra fílmica de Méliès fue pintada en el estudio de Thuillier.[26]​\n\nSegún la propia Thuillier, la tarde antes ella detallaba lo que debían hacer las pintores por lo general una solo tenía un color asignado para cada uno de las trabajadores. Al tener cada pintora una color determinado, un fotograma podría necesitar hasta 10 personas para que se terminase. Estos colores no eran los que había utilizado Mèliés en el rodaje, por lo que daban una mayor sensación de fantasía a la película. Las trabajadoras cobraban 1 franco al día y una película de 300 metros costaba 1000 francos de la época y se hacían unas 60 copias por producción.[1]​\n\nEl sistema de coloreado a mano era muy costo e impreciso, es por ello que empezaron a utilizarse otros sistemas como el creado por Segundo de Chomón (que había coloreado Barba azul del propio Méliès en 1901) que permitieron de forma precisa el coloreado de la película dentro de la silueta y llegando a aplicar hasta 5 colores a la vez. El sistema, según Serge Bomberg, resultaba menos fantasiosa y exuberante que el sistema del talle de Thuillier, pero podría ser más mecánico e industrial. Este nuevo invento fue presentado a Mèliés, incluso antes del estreno de Viaje a la Luna, sin embargo, el francés lo rechazó al preferir los sistemas más artesanales. Este sistema acabó en la empresa Pathé Frerés que compró la patente con el nombre de PathéColor.[27]​\n\nAunque las películas Méliès eran mudas, éstas no estaban destinadas a ser mudas. Es, por ello, que se usó la figura del narrador que explicaba lo que sucede en la pantalla acompañado de efectos sonoros y música.[28]​ Méliès tuvo especial interés por la música de sus películas y desarrolló composiciones originales para algunas de ellas, como El barbero de Sevilla.[29]​[30]​ A pesar de ello, Méliès nunca ordenó una música específica para sus películas, sino que permitió a los exhibidores acompañar a la película con la música que viesen más apropiada.[31]​ La música original de Viaje a la luna fue proyectada en el teatro Olympia de París en 1902, en una composición escrita por el propio Méliès.[32]​\n\nEn 1903, el compositor británico Erza Read compuso una pieza de piano llamada A Trip to the Moon: Comic Descriptive Fantasia, que seguía escena por escena la película de Méliès y pudo haberse usado como música para la película;[33]​ es posible que fuese encargada por en propio Méliès en uno de sus habituales viajes a Reino Unido.[31]​ Compositores más recientes hace desarrollo su propia música para la película como son Nicolas Godin y Jean-Benoit Dunckel d Air, Dorian Pimpernel Frederick Hodges, Robert Israel, Jeff Mills o Victor Young.[34]​[6]​[35]​[36]​\n\nCon su uso pionero de temas de ambición científica y descubrimiento, a Viaje a la luna a veces se la describe como la primera película de ciencia ficción.[37]​[38]​ Una breve historia del cine argumenta que codificó \"muchos de los elementos básicos situaciones genéricas que todavía se usan en las películas de ciencia ficción actuales \".[39]​ Sin embargo, varias otras designaciones de género son posibles; El propio Méliès promocionó la película como un gran espectáculo,[40]​ un término que se refiere a un tipo de espectacular espectáculo parisino popularizado por Julio Verne y Adolphe d'Ennery en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX.[41]​ Richard Abel describe la película como perteneciente al género Féerie,[32]​ al igual que Frank Kessler.[42]​ También puede describirse simplemente como una película de truco, un término general para el género popular de películas tempranas de cortos innovadores, llenos de efectos especiales, un género que Méliès había codificado y popularizado en sus trabajos anteriores.[43]​\n\nUn viaje a la luna es altamente satírico en tono, burlándose de la ciencia del siglo XIX exagerándola en el formato de una historia de aventuras.[44]​ La película no pretende ser científicamente plausible; Las verdaderas olas en la escena del chapoteo son la única concesión al realismo.[45]​ La estudiosa del cine Alison McMahan llama a Viaje a la luna uno de los primeros ejemplos de película patafísica, y dice que \"pretende mostrar la falta de lógica del pensamiento lógico\" con sus científicos ineptos satíricamente retratados, la cara de luna antropomórfica y las transgresiones imposibles de las leyes de la física.[46]​ El historiador cinematográfico Richard Abel cree que Méliès pretendía en la película \"invertir los valores jerárquicos de la sociedad francesa moderna y mantenerlos en ridículo en un motín de carnavalesco\".[46]​ Del mismo modo, el erudito literario y cinematográfico Edward Wagenknecht describió la película como una obra \"satirizando las pretensiones de los profesores y las sociedades científicas, a la vez que apela al sentido de asombro del hombre frente a un universo inexplorado\".[47]​\n\nTambién hay una fuerte vena antiimperialista en la sátira de la película[48]​[49]​ El estudioso del cine Matthew Solomon señala que la última parte de la película (la secuencia del desfile y la conmemoración que faltan en algunas impresiones) es especialmente contundente a este respecto. Argumenta que Méliès, que anteriormente había trabajado como dibujante político antibalangista, se burla de la dominación imperialista en la película al presentar a sus conquistadores coloniales como pedantes torpes que atacan sin piedad las formas de vida alienígenas que encuentran y regresan con un cautivo maltratado en medio de fanfarrias de autocontrol. felicidades La estatua de Barbenfouillis que se muestra en la toma final de la película incluso se parece a los pomposos e intimidantes colonialistas en las caricaturas políticas de Méliès.[49]​ La estudiosa del cine Elizabeth Ezra está de acuerdo en que \"Méliès se burla de las pretensiones de los relatos colonialistas de la conquista de una cultura por otra\", y agrega que \"su película también tematiza la diferenciación social en el frente de la casa, ya que se muestran los patrones jerárquicos en la luna tienen un curioso parecido con los de la tierra \".[48]​ Por su parte, el director Costa-Gavras, ve similitudes entre la conquista de la Luna con la conquista de África en donde los terrícolas al llegar optan por destruirlos a su llegada.[50]​\n\nEl estilo de la película, como el de la mayoría de las otras películas de Méliès, es deliberadamente teatral. Aunque Henri Langlois lo diferencia del teatro porque el teatro se basa en la palabra que aquí es silenciada por no haberse inventado el cine sonoro.[51]​ El escenario está altamente estilizado, recordando las tradiciones del escenario del siglo XIX, y está filmado por una cámara fija, colocada para evocar la perspectiva de un miembro de la audiencia sentado en un teatro.[52]​ Esta elección estilística fue una de las primeras y mayores innovaciones de Méliès en donde los espectadores sienten que están en la platea perfectamente centrados.[7]​ Si bien, el director Michel Hazanavicius compara el estilo visual de la película con el de un lienzo en movimiento por sus paisajes escarpados o su tono cartón piedra con un tono naif.[1]​ Paolo Cherchi ve un claro estilo barroco porque hay miedo al vacío en esta cinta como en las demás películas de Méliès de tal forma que llena el escenario con el mayor número de escenarios posibles.[6]​\n\nAunque inicialmente había seguido la tendencia popular de la época al hacer principalmente películas de actualidad (películas documentales cortas de la \"vida\" que capturan escenas y eventos reales para la cámara), en sus primeros años de filmación, Méliès se mudó gradualmente a lo mucho menos común género de películas narrativas ficticias, que llamó sus scènes composées o \"escenas arregladas artificialmente\".[5]​ El nuevo género estuvo ampliamente influenciado por la experiencia de Méliès en teatro y magia, especialmente su familiaridad con la popular tradición francesa de teatro, conocida por su tramas de fantasía y efectos visuales espectaculares, que incluyen espléndidos paisajes y efectos escénicos trabajados mecánicamente.[53]​ Langlois comentó que, a partir de esta película, Méliès alcanza la perfección decoración, el ritmo, movimiento y elocuencia.[51]​ En un anuncio, describió con orgullo la diferencia entre sus películas innovadoras y las realidades que todavía hacen sus contemporáneos: \"estas películas fantásticas y artísticas reproducen escenas escénicas y crean un nuevo género completamente diferente de las vistas cinematográficas ordinarias de personas reales y calles reales\".[54]​\n\nDebido a que Viaje a la luna precedió al desarrollo de la edición narrativa de cine por cineastas como Edwin S. Porter y D.W. Griffith, no utiliza el vocabulario cinematográfico al que las audiencias estadounidense y europea se acostumbraron más tarde, un vocabulario basado en el uso intencional de técnicas como ángulos de cámara variados, intercalados, yuxtaposiciones de tomas y otras ideas cinematográficas.[55]​ Más bien, cada configuración de cámara en la película de Méliès está diseñada como una escena dramática distinta, ininterrumpida por la edición visible, un enfoque que se ajusta al estilo teatral en el que se diseñó la película.[56]​ Si bien, Méliès hace uso en Viaje a la luna y otras películas del primer plano pero siempre como un elemento de trucaje y de agrandar objetos sin hacer uso de un lenguaje cinematográfico.[7]​\n\nDel mismo modo, los estudiosos del cine han señalado que el momento más famoso de Viaje a la luna juega con la continuidad temporal al mostrar un evento dos veces: primero se muestra la cápsula apareciendo de repente en el ojo de una luna antropomórfica; luego, en una toma mucho más cercana, el aterrizaje ocurre de manera muy diferente y mucho más realista, con la cápsula cayendo en picada en terreno lunar creíble.[57]​ Este tipo de narración no lineal, en la que el tiempo y el espacio son tratados como repetibles y flexibles en lugar de lineales y causales, es muy poco convencional según los estándares de Griffith y sus seguidores; sin embargo, antes del desarrollo de la edición de continuidad, otros cineastas realizaron experimentos similares con el tiempo. (Porter, por ejemplo, utilizó la discontinuidad temporal y la repetición ampliamente en su película de 1903 La vida de un bombero estadounidense).[57]​[58]​ Más tarde en el siglo XX, con el desarrollo de la repetición instantánea de la televisión deportiva, la repetición temporal volvió a ser familiar dispositivo para proyectar audiencias.[57]​\n\nDebido a que Méliès no utiliza un vocabulario cinematográfico moderno, algunos estudiosos del cine han creado otros marcos de pensamiento con los que evaluar sus películas. Por ejemplo, algunos académicos recientes, aunque no necesariamente niegan la influencia de Méliès en el cine, han argumentado que sus obras se entienden mejor como creaciones teatrales espectaculares enraizadas en la tradición teatral del siglo XIX de la féerie.[59]​ Es, por ello, que directores como Michel Hazanavicius, Costa-Gavras o Jean-Pierre Jeunet lo valoran como poesía que muestra las ilusiones, deseos y diversiones de la sociedad de principios del siglo XX.[50]​[8]​[60]​\n\nDel mismo modo, Tom Gunning ha argumentado que culpar a Méliès por no inventar un estilo de narración más íntimo y cinematográfico es malinterpretar el propósito de sus películas; Desde el punto de vista de Gunning, la primera década de la historia del cine puede considerarse un \"cine de atracciones\", en el que los cineastas experimentaron con un estilo de presentación basado en el espectáculo y la dirección directa en lugar de una edición compleja. Aunque el estilo de atracción del cine disminuyó en popularidad a favor de un enfoque más integrado de \"película de cuentos\", sigue siendo un componente importante de ciertos tipos de cine, incluidas las películas de ciencia ficción, los musicales y las películas de vanguardia.[61]​ Por otro parte, Paolo Cherchi expone que Méliès pone la cámara fija en el suelo, a pesar de que ya se habían rodado películas con la cámara en movimiento porque es el punto de vista de un espectador pasivo ante la experiencia visual siendo fiel a la filosofía estética del director.[6]​\n\nMéliès, que había comenzado Viaje a la luna en mayo de 1902, terminó la película en agosto de ese año y comenzó a vender impresiones a distribuidores franceses en el mismo mes.[62]​ De septiembre a diciembre de 1902, una impresión coloreada a mano de Un viaje a la luna se proyectó en el Théâtre Robert-Houdin de Méliès en París. La película fue exhibida después de las actuaciones matutinas del sábado y jueves por Jules-Eugène Legris.[12]​ Méliès vendió impresiones en blanco y negro y en color de la película a través de su Star Film Company,[12]​ donde se le asignó el número de catálogo 399–411[63]​ y se le dio el subtítulo descriptivo Pièce à grand spectacle en 30 planos.[40]​ En Francia, las impresiones en blanco y negro se vendieron por ₣ 560, y las impresiones coloreadas a mano por ₣ 1,000.[64]​ Méliès también vendió la película indirectamente a través de la Warwick Trading Company de Charles Urban en Londres.[12]​\n\nMuchas circunstancias que rodean la película, incluido su presupuesto, duración y tiempo de producción inusuales, así como sus similitudes con la atracción de Nueva York de 1901, indican que Méliès estaba especialmente interesado en estrenar la película en los Estados Unidos.[65]​ Debido a la piratería cinematográfica desenfrenada, Méliès nunca recibió la mayor parte de las ganancias de la popular película.[66]​ Una fuente informa que Méliès vendió una impresión de la película al fotógrafo de París Charles Gerschel para su uso en un teatro de Argel, bajo la estricta estipulación de que la impresión solo se muestre en Argelia. Gerschel vendió la impresión, y varias otras películas de Méliès, al empleado de Edison Manufacturing Company, Alfred C. Abadie, quien las envió directamente a los laboratorios de Edison para ser duplicadas y vendidas por Vitagraph. Copias de la impresión se extendieron a otras firmas, y en 1904 Siegmund Lubin, la Selig Polyscope Company y Edison estaban redistribuyéndola.[12]​ La impresión de Edison de la película incluso se ofreció en una versión coloreada a mano disponible a un precio más alto, tal como lo había hecho Méliès.[26]​ Méliès fue a menudo sin acreditar por completo; Durante los primeros seis meses de distribución de la película, el único expositor estadounidense que acreditó a Méliès en los anuncios de la película fue Thomas Lincoln Tally,[67]​ quien eligió la película como la presentación inaugural de su Teatro Eléctrico.[64]​\n\nMéliès se encontró ante dos probemas con el pirateo, por un lado no existe todavía unos derechos de autor y propiedad intelectual en el mercado cinematográfico y,[68]​ por otro, él también había hecho uso del pirateo con el sistema de perforación de películas que había inventado Edison.[69]​ Por ello, para combatir el problema de la piratería cinematográfica que se hizo evidente durante el lanzamiento de Viaje a la luna, Méliès abrió una sucursal estadounidense de Star Film Company, dirigida por su hermano Gaston Méliès, en Nueva York en 1903. La oficina fue diseñada vender las películas de Méliès directamente y protegerlas registrándolas bajo los derechos de autor de los Estados Unidos.[70]​ La introducción a la edición en inglés del catálogo de Star Film Company anunció: \"Al abrir una fábrica y una oficina en Nueva York, estamos preparados y decididos enérgicamente para perseguir a todos los falsificadores y piratas. ¡No hablaremos dos veces, actuaremos!\"[71]​\n\nAdemás de la apertura de la sucursal estadounidense, se realizaron varios acuerdos comerciales con otras compañías cinematográficas, incluidas American Mutoscope y Biograph, Warwick Trading Company, Charles Urban Trading Co., el estudio de Robert W. Paul y Gaumont.[70]​ En estas negociaciones, se estandarizó un precio de venta de impresión de US $ 0,15 por pie en todo el mercado estadounidense, lo que resultó útil para Méliès. Sin embargo, las estandarizaciones de precios posteriores por la Motion Picture Patents Company en 1908 aceleraron la ruina financiera de Méliès, ya que sus películas eran prácticamente costosas bajo los nuevos estándares. Además, en los años posteriores a 1908 sus películas sufrieron las modas de la época, ya que las fantásticas películas mágicas que hizo ya no estaban de moda.[70]​ Sin embargo, Méliès no llegó a la ruina hasta 1923 tras la prohibición de comedias tras la Primera Guerra Mundial por lo que tuvo que vender su estudio cinematográfico para paliar deudas.[72]​\n\nOtro de los problemas que se encontró en Estados Unidos fue el relacionado con las aduanas, como estaba la ley de papentes vigente no podían acceder a Estados Unidos la película. Su solución fue la de lo rodar la misma películas con dos cámaras, de tal forma que una copia se quedaba en Francia y, la otra, fue a Estados Unidos donde Gastón Méliès, hermano de George, se encargaba de terminarla en el laboratorio. Este sistema, con los años, no pudo hacerse ya que Thomas Edison les impedía estrenar esas cintas porque que Gastón empezó a rodar westerns con el nombre de G. Méliès, haciendo creer que eran películas de su hermano George. Tal fue así que Orson Welles homenajeó a George Méliès en la película The Magnificent Ambersons (1942) con un cartel de una cinta de su hermano, creyendo que era del mago parisino.[73]​\n\nInspirándose en Mélies, Segundo de Chomón lanzó al cine su filme Excursión a la Luna, muy pocos años después. Si bien esta película, producida por la Pathé, reproduce plano a plano la obra de Méliés no es considerada como plagio,[74]​ puesto que ese concepto todavía no existía en el mundo del cine.[27]​ La Pathè contrató a Chomón para competir y hundir a Méliès en su propio terreno, por lo que tomarán obras del propio director francés, no solo Viaje a la Luna; sino también con El melómano, El hombre orquesta, El diablo negro o Equilibrio imposible. El propio Segundo escribió a su hermano \"no es ya que esté obligado a realizar burdas copias de cuanto hace Méliès es que Pathé está poniendo todos los medios de los que dispone. Están destruyendo a un gran hombre, el único genio en medio de esta jauría de lobos hambrientos de dinero\".[27]​\n\nLa imagen de la cara de la Luna ha sido imitada muchas veces en la cultura popular, en dos vídeos musicales, por ejemplo, en el video de The Smashing Pumpkins de la canción \"Tonight, Tonight\".\n\nEn el último capítulo de la miniserie norteamericana para televisión De la Tierra a la Luna (1998) se recrea el rodaje de Viaje a la Luna (1902) paralelamente al desarrollo de la misión de la NASA Apolo 17, última vez hasta el momento en que el hombre pisó este satélite. Tom Hanks, quien hace de narrador, interpreta a un ayudante de Meliés, quien es interpretado por el actor francés de origen turco Tchéky Karyo.[75]​\n\nLa imagen de la cara de la luna con la nave clavada en uno de sus ojos es homenajeada en el segundo capítulo de la primera temporada de la serie de televisión Futurama. Los protagonistas de la serie visitan la luna, convertida en un parque de atracciones, y Bender clava una botella en el ojo de la mascota del parque, que tiene por cabeza precisamente la luna con cara de la película de Méliès.\n\nEl dúo francés de música electrónica Air, homenajea al film titulando del mismo modo que la película a su disco editado en 2012. La portada del álbum recrea a la luna con su ojo dañado.[76]​\n\nLa banda inglesa de rock, Queen, basa la película en el videoclip de la canción «Heaven for Everyone», perteneciente al disco Made in Heaven, donde se pueden ver escenas del rodaje a lo largo del tema junto a imágenes difusas y discretas de Freddie Mercury.\n\nLa película de Scorsese, La invención de Hugo (2011), hace referencia clara a la imagen de la luna herida, hacia el final se muestra el metraje íntegro, y hasta se relata y dramatiza en parte como se rodó esta película en el aquel momento, entre otros homenajes al director de la misma.[77]​\n\nMéliès, a diferencia de lo que hicieron Carlos Pathé y otros de sus rivales, vendió las copias de sus películas en lugar de alquilarlas.[78]​ A partir de 1909 Méliès ya solo pudo alquilarlas puesto que tras el segundo Congreso de Fabricantes de Películas, puesto que este sistema resulta más rentable para los grandes productores pero fue muy negativo para productores independientes como Méliès.[7]​ Según sus memorias, las primeras intentonas de venta de la película a los exhibidores franceses resultaron fallidas debido al inusual elevado precio de la película. Méliès ofreció dejar que uno de esos exhibidores prestara una copia de la película para proyectarla gratis. El elogio en sus primeras proyecciones provocó que las ferias se llenasen hasta la medianoche. Los exhibidores adquirieron la película y acabaron compensando.[71]​ La película fue un destacado éxito en Francia, siendo proyectada ininterrumpidamente durante varios meses en el Olympia de París.[32]​\n\nMéliès no se benefició del éxito de la película en Estados Unidos sino que lo hicieron Lubin, Selig o Edison, entre otros. Algunos ciudades donde tuvo gran éxito fueron New York City, Washington D. C., Cleveland, Detroit, New Orleans o Kansas City. También lo tendría en Alemania,España, Canadá e Italia.[79]​[80]​ Méliès poseyó agencias comerciales para promocionar la película en otros países, lo que motivó el éxito internacional.[78]​\n\nViaje a la luna fue el primer gran éxito mundial del cine y uno de los mayores éxitos de los primeros años del siglo XX.[1]​[81]​ El propio Méliès afirmó en sus últimos años de vida que no era su mejor película, su favorita fue la desaparecida La Civilisation à travers les âges.[82]​[Nota 1]​[83]​ Sin embargo, el director reconoció que es su obra maestra al tratarse de la primera película de este tipo en la historia.[84]​\n\nTanto la crítica y público contemporánea valora positivamente la película, a pesar de la notable evolución de este medio artístico desde entonces. Los descendientes de Méliès, en busca de mantener vigente el legado del parisino, proyectaron durante el siglo XXI en distintos lugares del mundo, destacando los países hispanoamericanos con afluencias de 2000 a 4000 personas en ocasiones.[85]​ Además posee valoraciones muy positivas por el público en web como AlloCiné, IMDb o FilmAffinity.[86]​[87]​[88]​\n\nLa crítica contemporánea suele tener en cuenta el momento de su estreno, ya que tantos los efectos como la narrativa del momento eran más avanzadas que las del siglo XXI.[89]​ La película apareció en varias listas de críticos, Andrew J. Rausch la califica como uno de los 32 momentos más importantes de la historia del cine,[90]​ se incluye entre las 1001 películas que hay que ver antes de morir,[91]​ obtener un 100% de reseñas positivas en Rotten Tomatoes u ocupar el puesto 84 entre las mejores películas del siglo XX según The Village Voice y el 178 en las mejores películas de la historia según Sight and Sound.[92]​[93]​[94]​\n\nTanto la novela como la película tiene errores físicos con respecto al lanzamiento del cañón. Uno de ellos se encuentra en la velocidad del cañón, ya que éste podía acelerar a los científicos hasta 3 km/s, siendo necesaria una velocidad de, al menos 11 km/s para salir de la esfera terrestre. Por otro lado, la fuerza g que deben soportar los científicos es de, al menos 60 veces superior al límite que puede soportar un ser humano.[95]​[96]​ Sadoul explica que en la película hay muestras de una fantasía desenfrenada, eliminando así, cualquier tipo de rigor científico. Así pues nos encontramos con momentos que reflejan esto tales como la escena inicial donde los científicos llevan vestidos estrellados y sombreros puntiagudos, evocando a Merlín el encantador y a Nostradamus.[97]​\n\nTanto George Saudol como Andrew J. Rausch afirman que la película supuso el triunfo de la puesta en escena sobre el plenairismo de los hermanos Lumiere.[68]​[90]​ El director Michel Hazanavicius afirma que uno de los motivos por el que Méliès superó el éxito de los inventores del cinematógrafo está en que Méliès consiguió crear una imagen icónica con la escena del cohete impactando en el ojo de la luna.[8]​ Su repercusión ya era analizada en 1903 cuando las palabras que encabezaron su catálogo en Estados Unidos exponían: \"George Méliès ha sido la primera persona que ha realizado películas cinematográficas con escenas artificialmente preparadas y mediante esta innovaciónha dado nueva vida a un comercio agonizante. Ha sido también el creador de películas con temas fantásticos o mágicos y sus obras han sido imitadas sin éxito en otros países.[7]​\n\nEl éxito comercial, tanto en Francia como en Estados Unidos, demostró la preferencia del público por la ficción frente a las fotografía animadas de los Lumiere, que derivarían en el documental. Esta tedencia fue iniciada por la Escuela de Brighton.[68]​[16]​ El académico define la película como los 32 momentos más cruciales de las historia del cine También sirvió de influencia a cineastas posteriores como es el caso de D.W. Griffith, Edwin S. Porter o Charles Chaplin, este último le apodaría como \"El alquimista de la luz\".[98]​[47]​ también abrió la puerta a maestros del trucaje como Segundo de Chomón o Gastón Velle para crear un cine fantasmagórico.[27]​[6]​\n\nGeorge Mèlies fue uno de los principales creadores de algunos trucos cinematográficos en el cine, destacando el de truco de parada o de sustitución.[78]​ Si bien durante muchos años esos mismos trucos fueron desarrollados y mejorados durante varias décadas después de su estreno, en la actualidad ya apenas se utilizan con la llegada del CGI y los efectos por ordenador.[60]​ Con esta película empezaría el periodo de máximo esplendor del cineasta que terminaría en 1908,[78]​ si bien hay autores, como Román Gubern, que citan el comienzo de su declive en 1906.[7]​ Esta obra aglutinó todos los que había desarrollado Mèlies es, por ello, que sigue siendo material de análisis para cineastas y estudiantes audiovisuales.\n\nEl crítico Manuel Villegas López lo define como el primer gran artista del cine que, tras el llamo \"Golpe de Estado de Pathé\",[99]​ no comprendió que se convertiría en industria y comercio, el arte del siglo XX en la época de la industria y las máquinas.[100]​ Ante este tipo de análisis el propio Méliès respondió: \"Caballero, ha sido un gran elogio. Si ustedes, los comerciantes, no tuvieran artistas que crearan y actuaran, me pregunto qué iban a vender\".[6]​\n\nDespués de las dificultades financieras y el declive de Méliès, la mayoría de las copias de sus impresiones se perdieron. En 1917, sus oficinas fueron ocupadas por el ejército francés, que fundió muchas de las películas de Méliès para reunir los rastros de plata del material de la película y hacer tacones de botas con el celuloide. Cuando el Teatro de Robert Houdin fue demolido en 1923 tras no poder hacer frente al préstamo de Charles Pathé que le concedió en 1911,[101]​[7]​ las impresiones guardadas allí se vendieron por peso a un vendedor de películas de segunda mano. Finalmente, en ese mismo año, Méliès tuvo un momento de ira y quemó todos sus negativos restantes en su jardín en Montreuil,[101]​ hecho del que se arrepintió en sus últimos años de vida.[6]​ En 1925, comenzó a vender juguetes y dulces desde un puesto en la Gare Montparnasse en París.[102]​ Viaje a la luna fue en gran parte olvidado por la historia y no se vio durante años.[81]​\n\nGracias a los esfuerzos de los devotos de la historia del cine, especialmente René Clair (quien asistió, junto a Alberto Cavalcanti, al funeral de Méliès en 1938),[7]​ Jean-George Auriol y Paul Gilson, Méliès y su trabajo fueron redescubiertos a fines de la década de 1920. Se celebró una \"Gala Méliès\" en la Salle Pleyel de París el 16 de diciembre de 1929 en celebración del cineasta, y fue galardonado con la Legión de Honor en 1931.[103]​ Durante este renacimiento de interés en Méliès, el director de cine Jean Mauclaire y el primer experimentador cinematográfico Jean Acme LeRoy se propusieron de forma independiente para localizar una impresión sobreviviente de Un viaje a la luna. Mauclaire obtuvo una copia de París en octubre de 1929, y LeRoy encontró una de Londres en 1930, aunque ambas impresiones estaban incompletas; Mauclaire carecía de la primera y la última escena, y a LeRoy's le faltaba toda la secuencia final con el desfile y la estatua conmemorativa. Estas impresiones ocasionalmente se proyectaron en retrospectivas (incluida la Gala Méliès), proyecciones de cine de vanguardia y otras ocasiones especiales, a veces en presentaciones del propio Méliès.[104]​\n\nDespués de la muerte de LeRoy en 1932, su colección de películas fue comprada por el Museo de Arte Moderno en 1936. La adquisición del museo y las proyecciones posteriores de A Trip to the Moon, bajo la dirección de la curadora de películas del MoMA, Iris Barry, abrieron la película una vez más para una amplia audiencia de estadounidenses y canadienses[104]​ y lo estableció definitivamente como un hito en la historia del cine.[105]​ La impresión incompleta de LeRoy se convirtió en la versión más vista de la película y la impresión original de la mayoría de las otras copias, incluida la impresión de la Cinemateca Francesa.[104]​ Una versión completa de la película, incluida toda la secuencia de celebración, fue finalmente reconstruida en 1997 a partir de varias fuentes por la Cinémathèque Méliès, una fundación creada por la familia Méliès.[106]​\n\nNo se sabía que las impresiones coloreadas a mano de Viaje a la luna sobrevivieran hasta 1993, cuando una donante anónimo la entregó a la Filmoteca de Cataluña como parte de una colección de doscientas películas mudas.[107]​ Se desconoce si esta versión, una impresión coloreada a mano de un negativo de segunda generación, fue coloreada por el laboratorio de Elisabeth Thuillier, pero las perforaciones utilizadas implican que la copia se hizo antes de 1906. La bandera ondeó durante la escena de lanzamiento en esta copia. está coloreado para parecerse a la bandera de España, lo que indica que la copia coloreada a mano fue hecha para un expositor español.[108]​\n\nEn 1999, Anton Giménez, de la Filmoteca de Cataluña, mencionó la existencia de esta impresión, que creía que estaba en un estado de descomposición total, a Serge Bromberg y Eric Lange, de la compañía cinematográfica francesa Lobster Films. Bromberg y Lange ofrecieron cambiar una película recientemente redescubierta de Segundo de Chomón por la impresión coloreada a mano, y Giménez aceptó. Bromberg y Lange consultaron a varios laboratorios especializados en un intento de restaurar la película, pero debido a que el carrete de la película aparentemente se había descompuesto en una masa rígida, ninguno creía que la restauración fuera posible. En consecuencia, Bromberg y Lange se pusieron a trabajar separando los fotogramas de la película, descubriendo que solo los bordes del material de la película se habían descompuesto y congelado, y por lo tanto, muchos de los fotogramas aún eran recuperables.[109]​ Entre 2002 y 2005, varios esfuerzos de digitalización permitieron guardar 13.375 fragmentos de imágenes de la impresión.[110]​ En 2010, Lobster Films, la Fundación Groupama Gan para el cine y la Fundación Technicolor para el patrimonio cinematográfico lanzaron una restauración completa de la impresión coloreada a mano.[107]​] Los fragmentos digitalizados de la impresión coloreada a mano fueron reensamblados y restaurados, con marcos faltantes recreados con la ayuda de una impresión en blanco y negro en poder de la familia Méliès, y convertidos en tiempo para correr a una auténtica velocidad de película muda , 14 Fotogramas por segundo. La restauración se completó en 2011[111]​ en los laboratorios de Technicolor en Los Ángeles.[112]​ Los costos de restauración fueron de 1 millón de dólares.[113]​\n\nLa versión restaurada se estrenó el 11 de mayo de 2011, dieciocho años después de su descubrimiento y 109 años después de su lanzamiento original, en el Festival Internacional de Cine de Cannes de 2011, con una nueva banda sonora de la banda francesa Air.[114]​ La restauración fue lanzada por Flicker Alley en una edición de 2 discos Blu-ray y DVD que también incluye El viaje extraordinario, un documental de larga duración de Bromberg y Lange sobre la restauración de la película, en 2012.[115]​ En The New York Times, A.

for flexibility in the application of such standards with respect to income by taking into account, except to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, the costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums, payments made to the State under section 1903(f)(2)(B), or otherwise and regardless of whether such costs are reimbursed under another public program of the State or political subdivision thereof) incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care recognized under State law;\n\n(18) comply with the provisions of section 1917 with respect to liens, adjustments and

alternate plans of care, making maximum utilization of available resources, for recipients 65 years of age or older who would otherwise need care in such institutions, including appropriate medical treatment and other aid or assistance; for services referred to in section 3(a)(4)(A)(i) and (ii)[27] or section 1603(a)(4)(A)(i) and (ii)[28] which are appropriate for such recipients and for such patients; and for methods of administration necessary to assure that the responsibilities of the State agency under the State plan with respect to such recipients and such patients will be effectively

making satisfactory progress toward developing and implementing a comprehensive mental health program, including provision for utilization of community mental health centers, nursing facilities, and other alternatives to care in public institutions for mental diseases;\n\n(22) include descriptions of (A) the kinds and numbers of professional medical personnel and supporting staff that will be

services, and (B) an enrollment of an individual eligible for medical assistance in a primary care case-management system (described in section 1915(b)(1)), a medicaid managed care organization, or a similar entity shall not restrict the choice of the qualified person from whom the individual may receive services under section 1905(a)(4)(C), except as provided in subsection (g), in section 1915, and in section 1932(a), except that this paragraph shall not apply in the case of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam, and except that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a State to provide medical assistance for such services furnished by a person or entity convicted of a felony under Federal or State law for an offense which the State agency determines is inconsistent with the best interests of beneficiaries under the State plan or by a provider or supplier to which a moratorium under subsection (kk)(4) is applied during the period of the moratorium;\n\n(24) effective July 1, 1969, provide for consultative services by health agencies and other appropriate agencies of the State to hospitals, nursing facilities, home health agencies, clinics, laboratories,

contract, or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service) to pay for care and services available under the plan, including—\n\n(i) the collection of sufficient information as specified by the Secretary in regulations) to enable the State to pursue claims against such third parties, with such information being collected at the time of any determination or redetermination of eligibility for medical assistance, and\n\n(ii) the submission to the Secretary of a plan (subject to approval by the Secretary) for pursuing claims against such third parties, which plan shall be integrated with, and be monitored as a part of the Secretary’s review of, the State’s mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems required under section 1903(r);\n\n(B) that in any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the State can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery, the State or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability;[30]\n\n(C) that in the case of an individual who is entitled to medical assistance under the State plan with respect to a service for which a third party is liable for payment, the person furnishing the service may not seek to collect from the individual (or any financially responsible relative or representative of that individual) payment of an amount for that service (i) if the total of the amount of the liabilities of third parties for that service is at least equal to the amount payable for that service under the plan (disregarding section 1916), or (ii) in an amount which exceeds the lesser of (I) the amount which may be collected under section 1916, or (II) the amount by which the amount payable for that service under the plan (disregarding section 1916) exceeds the total of the amount of the liabilities of third parties for that service;\n\n(D) that a person who furnishes services and is participating under the plan may not refuse to furnish services to an individual (who is entitled to have payment made under the plan for the services the person furnishes) because of a third party’s potential liability for payment for the service;\n\n(E) that in the case of preventive pediatric care (including early and periodic screening and diagnosis services under section 1905(a)(4)(B)) covered under the State plan, the State shall—[31]\n\n(i) make payment for such service in accordance with the usual payment schedule under such plan for such services without regard to the liability of a third party for payment for such services, except that the State may, if the State determines doing so is cost-effective and will not adversely affect access to care, only make such payment if a third party so liable has not made payment within 90 days after the date the provider of such services has initially submitted a claim to such third party for payment for such services; and[32]\n\n(ii) seek reimbursement from such third party in accordance with subparagraph (B);\n\n(F) that in the case of any services covered under such plan which are provided to an individual on whose behalf child support enforcement is being carried out by the State agency under part D of title IV of this Act, the State shall—\n\n(i) make payment for such service in accordance with the usual payment schedule under such plan for such services without regard to any third-party liability for payment for such services, if such third-party liability is derived (through insurance or otherwise) from the parent whose obligation to pay support is being enforced by such agency, if payment has not been made by such third party within 100 days after the date the provider of such services has initially submitted a claim to such third party for payment for such services, except that the State may make such payment within 30 days after such date if the State determines doing so is cost-effective and necessary to ensure access to care.[33]\n\n(ii) seek reimbursement from such third party in accordance with subparagraph (B);\n\n(G) that the State prohibits any health insurer (including a group health plan, as defined in section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974[34], a self-insured plan, a service benefit plan, and a health maintenance organization ), in enrolling an individual or in making any payments for benefits to the individual or on the individual’s behalf, from taking into account that the individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance under a plan under this title for such State, or any other State;\n\n(H) that to the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance in any case where a third party has a legal liability to make payment for such assistance, the State has in effect laws under which, to the extent that payment has been made under the State plan for medical assistance for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the State is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual to payment by any other party for such health care items or services; and[35]\n\n(I) that the State shall provide assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the State has in effect laws requiring health insurers, including self-insured plans, group health plans (as defined in section 607(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974[36]), service benefit plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, or other parties that are, by statute, contract, or agreement, legally responsible for payment of a claim for a health care item or service, as a condition of doing business in the State, to—\n\n(i) provide, with respect to individuals who are eligible (and, at State option, individuals who apply or whose eligibility for medical assistance is being evaluated in accordance with section 1902(e)(13)(D)) for, or are provided, medical assistance under a State plan (or under a waiver of the plan) under this title and child health assistance under title XXI, upon the request of the State, information to determine during what period the individual or their spouses or their dependents may be (or may have been) covered by a health insurer and the nature of the coverage that is or was provided by the health insurer (including the name, address, and identifying number of the plan) in a manner prescribed by the Secretary;[37]\n\n(ii) accept the State’s right of recovery and the assignment to the State of any right of an individual or other entity to payment from the party for an item or service for which payment has been made under the State plan;\n\n(iii) respond to any inquiry by the State regarding a claim for payment for any health care item or service that is submitted not later than 3 years after the date of the provision of such health care item or service; and\n\n(iv) agree not to deny a claim submitted by the State solely on the basis of the date of submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim form, or a failure to present proper documentation at the point-of-sale that is the basis of the claim, if—\n\n(I) the claim is submitted by the State within the 3-year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; and\n\n(II) any action by the State to enforce its rights with respect to such claim is commenced within 6 years of the State’s submission of such claim;\n\n(26) if the State plan includes medical assistance for inpatient mental hospital services, provide, with respect to each patient receiving such services, for a regular

services under the State plan under which such person or institution agrees (A) to keep such records as are necessary fully to disclose the extent of the services provided to individuals receiving assistance under the State plan, and (B) to furnish the State agency or the Secretary with such information, regarding any payments claimed by such person or institution for providing services under the State plan, as the State agency or the Secretary may from time to time request;\n\n(A) that any nursing facility receiving payments under such plan must satisfy all the requirements of subsections (b) through (d) of section 1919 as they apply to such facilities;\n\n(B) for including in “nursing facility services” at least the items and services specified (or deemed to be specified) by the Secretary under section 1919(f)(7) and making available upon request a description of the items and services so included;\n\n(C) for procedures to make available to the public the data and methodology used in establishing payment rates for nursing facilities under this title; and\n\n(D) for compliance (by the date specified in the respective sections) with the requirements of—\n\n(ii) section 1919(g) (relating to responsibility for survey and certification of nursing facilities); and\n\n(iii) sections 1919(h)(2)(B) and 1919(h)(2)(D) (relating to establishment and application of remedies);\n\n(29) include a State program which meets the requirements set forth in section 1908, for the licensing of administrators of nursing homes;\n\n(30)(A) provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of, and the payment for, care and services available under the plan (including but not limited to utilization review plans as provided for in section 1903(i)(4)) as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area; and\n\n(B) provide, under the program described in subparagraph (A), that—\n\n(i) each admission to a hospital, intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, or hospital for mental diseases is reviewed or screened in accordance with criteria established by medical and other professional personnel who are not themselves directly responsible for the care of the patient involved, and who do not have a significant financial interest in any such institution and are not, except in the case of a hospital, employed by the institution providing the care involved, and\n\n(ii) the information developed from such review or screening, along with the data obtained from prior reviews of the necessity for admission and continued stay of patients by such professional personnel, shall be used as the basis for establishing the size and composition of the sample of admissions to be subject to review and evaluation by such personnel, and any such sample may be of any size up to 100 percent of all admissions and must be of sufficient size to serve the purpose of (I) identifying the patterns of care being provided and the changes occurring over time in such patterns so that the need for modification may be ascertained, and (II) subjecting admissions to early or more extensive review where information indicates that such consideration is warranted to a hospital, intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded, or hospital for mental diseases;\n\n(31) with respect to services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded (where the State plan includes medical assistance for such services) provide, with respect to each patient receiving such services, for a written plan of care, prior to admission to or authorization of benefits in such facility, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, and for a regular program of independent professional review (including medical evaluation) which shall periodically review his need for such services;\n\n(32) provide that no payment under the plan for any care or service provided to an individual shall be made to anyone other than such individual or the person or institution providing such care or service, under an assignment or power of attorney or otherwise; except that—\n\n(A) in the case of any care or service provided by a physician, dentist, or other individual practitioner, such payment may be made (i) to the employer of such physician, dentist, or other practitioner if such physician, dentist, or practitioner is required as a condition of his employment to turn over his fee for such care or service to his employer, or (ii) (where the care or service was provided in a hospital, clinic, or other facility) to the facility in which the care or service was provided if there is a contractual arrangement between such physician, dentist, or practitioner and such facility under which such facility submits the bill for such care or service;\n\n(B) nothing in this paragraph shall be construed (i) to prevent the making of such a payment in accordance with an assignment from the person or institution providing the care or service involved if such assignment is made to a governmental agency or entity or is established by or pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) to preclude an agent of such person or institution from receiving any such payment if (but only if) such agent does so pursuant to an agency agreement under which the compensation to be paid to the agent for his services for or in connection with the billing or collection of payments due such person or institution under the plan is unrelated (directly or indirectly) to the amount of such payments or the billings therefor, and is not dependent upon the actual collection of any such payment;\n\n(C) in the case of services furnished (during a period that does not exceed 14 continuous days in the case of an informal reciprocal arrangement or 90 continuous days (or such longer period as the Secretary may provide) in the case of an arrangement involving per diem or other fee-for-time compensation) by, or incident to the services of, one physician to the patients of another physician who submits the claim for such services, payment shall be made to the physician submitting the claim (as if the services were furnished by, or incident to, the physician’s services), but only if the claim identifies (in a manner specified by the Secretary) the physician who furnished the services; and\n\n(D) in the case of payment for a childhood vaccine administered before October 1, 1994, to individuals entitled to medical assistance under the State plan, the State plan may make payment directly to the manufacturer of the vaccine under a voluntary

vaccine, and (iii) charges the State the manufacturer’s price to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the vaccine so administered (which price includes a reasonable amount to cover shipping and the handling of returns);\n\n(A) that the State health agency, or other appropriate State medical agency, shall be responsible for establishing a plan, consistent with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, for the review by appropriate professional health personnel of the appropriateness and quality of care and services furnished to recipients of medical assistance under the plan in order to provide guidance with respect thereto in the administration of the plan to the State agency established or designated pursuant to paragraph (5) and, where applicable, to the State agency described in the second sentence of this subsection; and\n\n(B) that, except as provided in section 1919(g), the State or local agency utilized by the Secretary for the purpose specified in the first sentence of section 1864(a), or, if such agency is not the State agency which is responsible for licensing health institutions, the State agency responsible for such licensing, will perform for the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the plan approved under this title the function of determining whether institutions and agencies meet the requirements for participation in the program under such plan, except that, if the Secretary has cause to question the adequacy of such determinations, the Secretary is authorized to validate State determinations and, on that basis, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which individual institutions and agencies meet the requirements for participation;\n\n(34) provide that in the case of any individual who has been determined to be eligible for medical assistance under the plan, such assistance will be made available to him for care and services included under the plan and

and place the pertinent findings of each such survey relating to the compliance of each such health care facility, laboratory, clinic, agency, or organization with (A) the statutory conditions of participation imposed under this title, and (B) the major additional conditions which the Secretary finds necessary in the interest of health and safety of individuals who are furnished care or services by any such facility, laboratory, clinic, agency, or organization;\n\n(37) provide for claims payment procedures which (A) ensure that 90 per centum of claims for payment (for which no

described in section 1128(b)(9);[38]\n\n(39) provide that the State agency shall exclude any specified individual or entity from participation in the program under the State plan for the period

supervises, shall be regarded as a separate plan for purposes of this title (except for purposes of paragraph (10)). The provisions of paragraphs (9)(A), (31), and (33) and of section 1903(i)(4) shall not apply to a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in section 1861(ss)(1)).\n\nFor purposes of paragraph (10) any individual who, for the month of August 1972, was eligible for or receiving aid or assistance under a State plan approved under title I, X, XIV, or XVI, or part A of title IV and who for such month was entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II shall for purposes of this title only be deemed to be eligible for financial aid or assistance for any month thereafter if such individual would have been eligible for financial aid or assistance for such month had the increase in monthly insurance benefits under title II resulting from enactment of Public Law 92-336[61] not been applicable to such individual.\n\nThe requirement of clause[62] (A) of paragraph (37) with respect to a State plan may be waived by the Secretary if he finds that the State has exercised good faith in trying to meet such requirement.

1981[73]) applicable to a family of the size involved.\n\n(ii) The percentage provided under this clause, with respect to eligibility for medical assistance on or after—\n\n(I) July 1, 1989, is 75 percent, or, if greater, the percentage provided under clause (iii), and\n\n(II) April 1, 1990, 133 percent, or, if greater, the percentage provided under clause (iv).\n\n(iii) In the case of a State which, as of the date of the enactment of this clause[74], has elected to provide, and provides, medical assistance to individuals described in this subsection or has enacted legislation authorizing, or appropriating funds, to provide such assistance to such individuals before July 1, 1989, the percentage provided under clause (ii)(I) shall not be less than—\n\n(I) the percentage specified by the State in an amendment to its State plan (whether approved or not) as of the date of the enactment of this clause, or\n\n(II) if no such percentage is specified as of the date of the enactment of this clause, the percentage established under the State’s authorizing legislation or provided for under the State’s appropriations;\n\nbut in no case shall this clause require the percentage provided under clause (ii)(I) to exceed 100 percent.\n\n(iv) In the case of a State which, as of the date of the enactment of this clause[75], has established under clause (i), or has enacted legislation authorizing, or appropriating funds, to provide for, a percentage (of the income official poverty line) that is greater than 133 percent, the percentage provided under clause (ii) for medical assistance on or after April 1, 1990, shall not be less than—\n\n(I) the percentage specified by the State in an amendment to its State plan (whether approved or not) as of the date of the enactment of this clause, or\n\n(II) if no such percentage is specified as of the date of the enactment of this clause, the percentage established under the State’s authorizing legislation or provided for under the State’s appropriations.\n\n(B) For purposes of paragraph (1) with respect to individuals described in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph, the State shall establish an income level which is equal to 133 percent of the income official poverty line described in subparagraph (A) applicable to a family of the size involved.\n\n(C)[76] For purposes of paragraph (1) with respect to individuals described in subparagraph (D) of that paragraph, the State shall establish an income level which is equal to 100 percent (or, beginning January 1, 2014, 133 percent) of the income official poverty line described in subparagraph (A) applicable to a family of the size involved.\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for individuals who are eligible for medical assistance because of subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), or (a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX)—\n\n(A) application of a resource standard shall be at the option of the State;\n\n(B) any resource standard or methodology that is applied with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) may not be more restrictive than the resource standard or methodology that is applied under title XVI;\n\n(C) any resource standard or methodology that is applied with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) may not be more restrictive than the corresponding methodology that is applied under the State plan under part A of title IV;\n\n(D) the income standard to be applied is the appropriate income standard established under paragraph (2); and\n\n(E) family income shall be determined in accordance with the methodology employed under the State plan under part A or E of title IV (except to the extent such methodology is inconsistent with clause (D) of subsection (a)(17)), and costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account.\n\nAny different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals.\n\n(4)(A) In the case of any State which is providing medical assistance to its residents under a waiver granted under section 1115, the Secretary shall require the State to provide medical assistance for pregnant women and infants under age 1 described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV) and for children described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI) or subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) in the same manner as the State would be required to provide such assistance for such individuals if the State had in effect a plan approved under this title.\n\n(B) In the case of a State which is not one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia, the State need not meet the requirement of subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), or (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII) and, for purposes of paragraph (2)(A), the State may substitute for the percentage provided under clause (ii) of such paragraph any percentage.\n\n(m)(1) Individuals described in this paragraph are individuals—\n\n(A) who are 65 years of age or older or are disabled individuals (as determined under section 1614(a)(3)),\n\n(B) whose income (as determined under section 1612 for purposes of the supplemental security income program, except as provided in paragraph (2)(C)) does not exceed an income level established by the State consistent with paragraph (2)(A), and\n\n(C) whose resources (as determined under section 1613 for purposes of the supplemental security income program) do not exceed (except as provided in paragraph (2)(B)) the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have and obtain benefits under that program.\n\n(2)(A) The income level established under paragraph (1)(B) may not exceed a percentage (not more than 100 percent) of the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981[77]) applicable to a family of the size involved.\n\n(B) In the case of a State that provides medical assistance to individuals not described in subsection (a)(10)(A) and at the State’s option, the State may use under paragraph (1)(C) such resource level (which is higher than the level described in that paragraph) as may be applicable with respect to individuals described in paragraph (1)(A) who are not described in subsection (a)(10)(A).\n\n(C) The provisions of section 1905(p)(2)(D) shall apply to determinations of income under this subsection in the same manner as they apply to determinations of income under section 1905(p).\n\n(3) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for individuals described in paragraph (1) who are covered under the State plan by virtue of subsection (a)(10)(A)(ii)(X)—\n\n(A) the income standard to be applied is the income standard described in paragraph (1)(B), and\n\n(B) except as provided in section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii), costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account in determining income.\n\nAny different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals.\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for qualified medicare beneficiaries described in section 1905(p)(1)—\n\n(A) the income standard to be applied is the income standard described in section 1905(p)(1)(B), and\n\n(B) except as provided in section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii), costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account in determining income.\n\nAny different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals.\n\n(n)(1) In the case of medical assistance furnished under this title for medicare cost-sharing respecting the furnishing of a service or item to a qualified medicare beneficiary, the State plan may provide payment in an amount with respect to the service or item that results in the sum of such payment amount and any amount of payment made under title XVIII with respect to the service or item exceeding the amount that is otherwise payable under the State plan for the item or service for eligible individuals who are not qualified medicare beneficiaries.\n\n(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), a State is not required to provide any payment for any expenses incurred relating to payment for deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments for medicare cost–sharing to the extent that payment under title XVIII for the service would exceed the payment amount that otherwise would be made under the State plan under this title for such service if provided to an eligible recipient other than a medicare beneficiary.\n\n(3) In the case in which a State’s payment for medicare cost-sharing for a qualified medicare beneficiary with respect to an item or service is reduced or eliminated through the application of paragraph (2)—\n\n(A) for purposes of applying any limitation under title XVIII on the amount that the beneficiary may be billed or charged for the service, the amount of payment made under title XVIII plus the amount of payment (if any) under the State plan shall be considered to be payment in full for the service;\n\n(B) the beneficiary shall not have any legal liability to make payment to a provider or to an organization described in section 1903(m)(1)(A) for the service; and\n\n(C) any lawful sanction that may be imposed upon a provider or such an organization for excess charges under this title or title XVIII shall apply to the imposition of any charge imposed upon the individual in such case.\n\nThis paragraph shall not be construed as preventing payment of any medicare cost–sharing by a medicare supplemental policy or an employer retiree health plan on behalf of an individual.\n\n(o) Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) to the contrary, a State plan under this title shall provide that any supplemental security income benefits paid by reason of subparagraph (E) or (G) of section 1611(e)(1) to an individual who—\n\n(1) is eligible for medical assistance under the plan, and\n\n(2) is in a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility at the time such benefits are paid,\n\nwill be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of any post-eligibility contribution by the individual to the cost of the care and services provided by the hospital, skilled nursing facility, or intermediate care facility.\n\n(p)(1) In addition to any other authority, a State may exclude any individual or entity for purposes of participating under the State plan under this title for any reason for which the Secretary could exclude the individual or entity from participation in a program under title XVIII under section 1128, 1128A, or 1866(b)(2).\n\n(2) In order for a State to receive payments for medical assistance under section 1903(a), with respect to payments the State makes to a medicaid managed care organization (as defined in section 1903(m)) or to an entity furnishing services under a waiver approved under section 1915(b)(1), the State must provide that it will exclude from participation, as such an organization or entity, any organization or entity that—\n\n(A) could be excluded under section 1128(b)(8) (relating to owners and managing employees who have been convicted of certain crimes or received other sanctions),\n\n(B) has, directly or indirectly, a substantial contractual relationship (as defined by the Secretary) with an individual or entity that is described in section 1128(b)(8)(B), or\n\n(C) employs or contracts with any individual or entity that is excluded from participation under this title under section 1128 or 1128A for the provision of health care, utilization review, medical social work, or administrative services or employs or contracts with any entity for the provision (directly or indirectly) through such an excluded individual or entity of such services.\n\n(3) As used in this subsection, the term “exclude” includes the refusal to enter into or renew a participation agreement or the termination of such an agreement.\n\n(q)(1)(A) In order to meet the requirement of subsection (a)(50), the State plan must provide that, in the case of an institutionalized individual or couple described in subparagraph (B), in determining the amount of the individual’s or couple’s income to be applied monthly to payment for the cost of care in an institution, there shall be deducted from the monthly income (in addition to other allowances otherwise provided under the State plan) a monthly personal needs allowance—\n\n(i) which is reasonable in amount for clothing and other personal needs of the individual (or couple) while in an institution, and\n\n(ii) which is not less (and may be greater) than the minimum monthly personal needs allowance described in paragraph (2).\n\n(B) In this subsection, the term “institutionalized individual or couple” means an individual or married couple—\n\n(i) who is an inpatient (or who are inpatients) in a medical institution or nursing facility for which payments are made under this title throughout a month, and\n\n(ii) who is or are determined to be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan.\n\n(2) The minimum monthly personal needs allowance described in this paragraph is $30 for an institutionalized individual and $60 for an institutionalized couple (if both are aged, blind, or disabled, and their incomes are considered available to each other in determining eligibility).\n\n(r)(1)(A) For purposes of sections 1902(a)(17) and 1924(d)(1)(D) and for purposes of a waiver under section 1915, with respect to the post-eligibility treatment of income of individuals who are institutionalized or receiving home or community-based services under such a waiver, the treatment described in subparagraph (B) shall apply, there shall be disregarded reparation payments made by the Federal Republic of Germany, and there shall be taken into account amounts for incurred expenses for medical or remedial care that are not subject to payment by a third party, including—\n\n(i) medicare and other health insurance premiums, deductibles, or coinsurance, and\n\n(ii) necessary medical or remedial care recognized under State law but not covered under the State plan under this title, subject to reasonable limits the State may establish on the amount of these expenses.\n\n(B)(i) In the case of a veteran who does not have a spouse or a child, if the veteran—\n\n(I) receives, after the veteran has been determined to be eligible for medical assistance under the State plan under this title, a veteran’s pension in excess of $90 per month, and\n\n(II) resides in a State veterans home with respect to which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs makes per diem payments for nursing home care pursuant to section 1741(a) of title 38, United States Code[78],\n\nany such pension payment, including any payment made due to the need for aid and attendance, or for unreimbursed medical expenses, that is in excess of $90 per month shall be counted as income only for the purpose of applying such excess payment to the State veterans home’s cost of providing nursing home care to the veteran.\n\n(ii) The provisions of clause (i) shall apply with respect to a surviving spouse of a veteran who does not have a child in the same manner as they apply to a veteran described in such clause.\n\n(2)(A) The methodology to be employed in determining income and resource eligibility for individuals under subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(III), (a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), (a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), (a)(10)(A)(ii), (a)(10)(C)(i)(III), or (f) or under section 1905(p) may be less restrictive, and shall be no more restrictive, than the methodology—\n\n(i) in the case of groups consisting of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, under the supplemental security income program under title XVI, or\n\n(ii) in the case of other groups, under the State plan most closely categorically related.\n\n(B) For purposes of this subsection and subsection (a)(10), methodology is considered to be “no more restrictive” if, using the methodology, additional individuals may be eligible for medical assistance and no individuals who are otherwise eligible are made ineligible for such assistance.\n\n(s) In order to meet the requirements of subsection (a)(55), the State plan must provide that payments to hospitals under the plan for inpatient hospital services furnished to infants who have not attained the age of 1 year, and to children who have not attained the age of 6 years and who receive such services in a disproportionate share hospital described in section 1923(b)(1), shall—\n\n(1) if made on a prospective basis (whether per diem, per case, or otherwise) provide for an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for medically necessary inpatient hospital services involving exceptionally high costs or exceptionally long lengths of stay,\n\n(2) not be limited by the imposition of day limits with respect to the delivery of such services to such individuals, and\n\n(3) not be limited by the imposition of dollar limits (other than such limits resulting from prospective payments as adjusted pursuant to paragraph (1)) with respect to the delivery of such services to any such individual who has not attained their first birthday (or in the case of such an individual who is an inpatient on his first birthday until such individual is discharged).\n\n(t) Nothing in this title (including sections 1903(a) and 1905(a)) shall be construed as authorizing the Secretary to deny or limit payments to a State for expenditures, for medical assistance for items or services, attributable to taxes of general applicability imposed with respect to the provision of such items or services.\n\n(u)(1) Individuals described in this paragraph are individuals—\n\n(A) who are entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage (as defined in paragraph (3)),\n\n(B) whose income (as determined under section 1612 for purposes of the supplemental security income program) does not exceed 100 percent of the official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981[79]) applicable to a family of the size involved,\n\n(C) whose resources (as determined under section 1613 for purposes of the supplemental security income program) do not exceed twice the maximum amount of resources that an individual may have and obtain benefits under that program, and\n\n(D) with respect to whose enrollment for COBRA continuation coverage the State has determined that the savings in expenditures under this title resulting from such enrollment is likely to exceed the amount of payments for COBRA premiums made.\n\n(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(10)(F) and this subsection, the term “COBRA premiums” means the applicable premium imposed with respect to COBRA continuation coverage.\n\n(3) In this subsection, the term “COBRA continuation coverage” means coverage under a group health plan provided by an employer with 75 or more employees provided pursuant to title XXII of the Public Health Service Act, section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974[80].\n\n(4) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(17), for individuals described in paragraph (1) who are covered under the State plan by virtue of subsection (a)(10)(A)(ii)(XI)—\n\n(A) the income standard to be applied is the income standard described in paragraph (1)(B), and\n\n(B) except as provided in section 1612(b)(4)(B)(ii), costs incurred for medical care or for any other type of remedial care shall not be taken into account in determining income.\n\nAny different treatment provided under this paragraph for such individuals shall not, because of subsection (a)(10)(B) or (a)(17), require or permit such treatment for other individuals.\n\n(v) A State plan may provide for the making of determinations of disability or blindness for the purpose of determining eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan by the single State agency or its designee, and make medical assistance available to individuals whom it finds to be blind or disabled and who are determined otherwise eligible for such assistance during the period of time prior to which a final determination of disability or blindness is made by the Social Security Administration with respect to such an individual. In making such determinations, the State must apply the definitions of disability and blindness found in section 1614(a) of the Social Security Act.\n\n(w)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(57) and sections 1903(m)(1)(A) and 1919(c)(2)(E), the requirement of this subsection is that a provider or organization (as the case may be) maintain written policies and procedures with respect to all adult individuals receiving medical care by or through the provider or organization—\n\n(A) to provide written information to each such individual concerning—\n\n(i) an individual’s rights under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) to make decisions concerning such medical care, including the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and the right to formulate advance directives (as defined in paragraph (3)), and\n\n(ii) the provider’s or organization’s written policies respecting the implementation of such rights;\n\n(B) to document in the individual’s medical record whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive;\n\n(C) not to condition the provision of care or otherwise discriminate against an individual based on whether or not the individual has executed an advance directive;\n\n(D) to ensure compliance with requirements of State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) respecting advance directives; and\n\n(E) to provide (individually or with others) for education for staff and the community on issues concerning advance directives.\n\nSubparagraph (C) shall not be construed as requiring the provision of care which conflicts with an advance directive.\n\n(2) The written information described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be provided to an adult individual—\n\n(A) in the case of a hospital, at the time of the individual’s admission as an inpatient,\n\n(B) in the case of a nursing facility, at the time of the individual’s admission as a resident,\n\n(C) in the case of a provider of home health care or personal care services, in advance of the individual coming under the care of the provider,\n\n(D) in the case of a hospice program, at the time of initial receipt of hospice care by the individual from the program, and\n\n(E) in the case of a medicaid managed care organization, at the time of enrollment of the individual with the organization.\n\n(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the application of a State law which allows for an objection on the basis of conscience for any health care provider or any agent of such provider which as a matter of conscience cannot implement an advance directive.\n\n(4) In this subsection, the term “advance directive” means a written instruction, such as a living will or durable power of attorney for health care, recognized under State law (whether statutory or as recognized by the courts of the State) and relating to the provision of such care when the individual is incapacitated.\n\n(5) For construction relating to this subsection, see section 7 of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997 (relating to clarification respecting assisted suicide, euthanasia, and mercy killing)[81].\n\n(x) The Secretary shall establish a system, for implementation by not later than July 1, 1991, which provides for a unique identifier for each physician who furnishes services for which payment may be made under a State plan approved under this title.[82]\n\n(y)(1) In addition to any other authority under State law, where a State determines that a psychiatric hospital which is certified for participation under its plan no longer meets the requirements for a psychiatric hospital (referred to in section 1905(h)) and further finds that the hospital’s deficiencies—\n\n(A) immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State shall terminate the hospital’s participation under the State plan; or\n\n(B) do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of its patients, the State may terminate the hospital’s participation under the State plan, or provide that no payment will be made under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to such hospital after the effective date of the finding, or both.\n\n(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if a psychiatric hospital described in paragraph (1)(B) has not complied with the requirements for a psychiatric hospital under this title—\n\n(A) within 3 months after the date the hospital is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall provide that no payment will be made under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to such hospital after the end of such 3-month period, or\n\n(B) within 6 months after the date the hospital is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, no Federal financial participation shall be provided under section 1903(a) with respect to further services provided in the hospital until the State finds that the hospital is in compliance with the requirements of this title.\n\n(3) The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months from the date the hospital is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, if—\n\n(A) the State finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the hospital with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the hospital,\n\n(B) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and\n\n(C) the State agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this paragraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.\n\n(z)(1) Individuals described in this paragraph are individuals not described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)—\n\n(A) who are infected with tuberculosis;\n\n(B) whose income (as determined under the State plan under this title with respect to disabled individuals) does not exceed the maximum amount of income a disabled individual described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i) may have and obtain medical assistance under the plan; and\n\n(C) whose resources (as determined under the State plan under this title with respect to disabled individuals) do not exceed the maximum amount of resources a disabled individual described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i) may have and obtain medical assistance under the plan.\n\n(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(10), the term “TB-related services” means each of the following services relating to treatment of infection with tuberculosis:\n\n(B) Physicians’ services and services described in section 1905(a)(2).\n\n(C) Laboratory and X-ray services (including services to confirm the presence of infection).\n\n(F) Services (other than room and board) designed to encourage completion of regimens of prescribed drugs by outpatients, including services to observe directly the intake of prescribed drugs.\n\n(aa) Individuals described in this subsection are individuals who—\n\n(1) are not described in subsection (a)(10)(A)(i);\n\n(3) have been screened for breast and cervical cancer under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention breast and cervical cancer early detection program established under title XV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300k et seq.) in accordance with the requirements of section 1504 of that Act (42 U.S.C. 300n) and need treatment for breast or cervical cancer;

This substantial volume of eligibility caseload work, coupled with significant staffing shortages, could cause many states to face substantial operational and system challenges. To support states facing significant operational issues with income and eligibility determination systems and to protect eligible beneficiaries from inappropriate coverage losses during the unwinding period following the end of the COVID-19 PHE, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is providing states the option to request authority under section 1902(e)(14)(A) of the Social Security Act (the Act) in limited circumstances and subject to CMS approval.\n\nAs outlined in the March 3, 2022 State Health Official (SHO) letter #22-001, states may request time-limited authority under section 1902(e)(14)(A) of the Act to pursue strategies to support the unwinding period following the end of the COVID-19 PHE that facilitate the renewal process and ensure due process protections during the fair hearing process.\n\nAs of December 11, 2024, CMS has approved a number of 1902(e)(14)(A) waivers in relation to unwinding related challenges that states face. These include:\n• Strategies to Support Enrollees with Renewal Form Submission or Completion to Reduce Procedural Terminations\n• Strategies to Facilitate Reinstatement of Eligible Individuals for Procedural Reasons States may also request authority under section 1902(e)(14)(A) of the Act to implement other strategies needed to ensure that they can establish income and eligibility determination and operations systems that protect beneficiaries during the unwinding period, including strategies that will support compliance with federal renewal requirements following the end of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) Medicaid continuous enrollment condition. States that have opted for these strategies, including through mitigation plans, are included under the “Other” categories in the table below.\n\nFor additional information on 1902(e)(14)(A) waivers and other strategies to prevent procedural terminations, see SHO letter #22-001 and State Strategies to Prevent Procedural Terminations. Please note that this chart represents unwinding strategies approved under section 1902(e)(14)(A) authority and is not an exhaustive list of strategies a state has otherwise adopted to protect beneficiaries.

Each story is directed by different people but unlike Animatrix (WB's first animated filler compilation, done for the Matrix series), the look and feel of every episode is too similar to actually distinguish. The mood is more dark, violent and brooding than any other screen Batman interpretations. The first episode starts of relatively lightweight and is the most humorous. The stories then get edgier and darker. The whole compilation makes for an enjoyable viewing as Batman deals with the wild imagination of kids, spiritual healing, Hinduism!, Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and a hit-man called Deadshot. But for me, the real joy of watching Gotham Knights is listening to the definitive Batman/Bruce Wayne voice that is Kevin Conroy, who has been the voice of Batman in every animated form from 1990 to 2006 (I think). Here, he is the voice of several variations of Batman and is pure joy to listen to. I have to admit though that a couple of Bruce Wayne animated interpretations don't really fit with his voice but Conroy's voice acting more than makes up for it. The animation is great but not anywhere near as radical as Animatrix or recent Anime films. The action scenes are quite thrilling. Also, very worthy of mention is the exhilarating soundtrack, particularly in the Scarecrow episode. All in all, this is a great addition to the Batman animated collections."}

Fue tal el éxito, que hubo que proceder a un cambio de sede a causa del continuo aumento de alumnos. En el año 1583 el papa Gregorio XIII inauguró la nueva sede del Colegio Romano en un edificio situado en Roma, en la plaza que sigue todavía hoy llamándose así. Debido a este hecho, y a que este papa fue el fundador y el protector de la misma, tomará nombre de \"Gregoriana\".\n\nEn el año 1773, como consecuencia de la supresión de la Compañía de Jesús, el Colegio fue confiado a la custodia del clero secular romano. Sin embargo, el 17 de mayo de 1824, el papa León XII, refundada la Compañía de Jesús, le devolvió su custodia. En el año 1873, el Colegio Romano, sufrió un nuevo traslado, esta vez la sede fue ubicado en el Edificio Borromeo, también situado en Roma, en calle del Seminario, actualmente sede del Colegio Bellarmino. Ese mismo año el papa Pío IX, el 4 de diciembre de 1873, concedió al Colegio el derecho a asumir el título de \"Pontificia Universidad del Colegio Romano\", y a su rector el poder suscribirse como \"Rector de la Pontificia Universidad Gregoriana\". En 1980 fue nombrado rector el jesuita español Urbano Navarrete (Camarena de la Sierra, Teruel; 1920), hasta entonces decano de Derecho Canónico.\n\nDesde 2004 hasta el 2010, el rector fue el reverendo padre Gianfranco Ghirlanda. Su nombramiento fue anunciado el 1 de abril de 2004 y tomó posesión el 1 de septiembre de dicho año. En 2010 fue nombrado el padre François-Xavier Dumortier.[1]​\n\nPor su lado, el rector emérito de esta institución, el citado R.P. Urbano Navarrete, fue nombrado cardenal por Benedicto XVI, en el Consistorio de 24 de noviembre de 2007, anunciado el día 17 de octubre.\n\nPero la universidad continuó creciendo y con ella las exigencias de espacio, por tanto en 1919, el papa Benedicto XV, adquirió en la Piazza della Pilotta el terreno para la erección de la nueva sede, y será el papa Pio XI el que tome el relevo empeñándose en no diferir por más tiempo su construcción, de manera que el 27 de diciembre de 1924 el cardenal Bisleti puso la primera piedra. La nueva y actual ubicación se encuentra en una de las plazas más tranquilas del centro de Roma, a los pies del Quirinale[[]] y enfrente de la monumental Villa Colonna.\n\nLa fachada actual recuerda el estilo arquitectónico de finales del siglo XVI y al antiguo Colegio Romano.\n\nEl cuadripórtico central, todo él de travertino, tiene dos ventanales en simetría con las dos escaleras monumentales rematadas con dos áticos que portan los escudos de armas de los papas Gregorio XIII y León XII, fundador y restablecedor del secular instituto, respectivamente.\n\nLa galería del primer piso está decorada con el escudo de armas de Pío XI, último impulsor y promotor de la actual obra.\n\nPosee una biblioteca que contiene actualmente cerca de 800 000 libros y 3500 revistas, con seis salas de lectura, para un total de 400 plazas y un adecuado edificio destinado al depósito de los libros.\n\nEn los últimos años la sede de la Universidad Gregoriana ha aumentado debido a la creciente número de alumnos, como ocurriera en sus orígenes.\n\nAsí pues, hoy se compone de varios edificios anexos entre sí: la Traspontina, edificio situado detrás del central; el Palacio de los Lucchesi a la izquierda de la puerta principal según se entra y, delante de este, el edificio Frascara, cerrando el flanco izquierdo de la Piazza della Pilotta.\n\nRecientemente, en los sótanos del edificio central se ha realizado un moderno complejo de salas y aulas multifuncionales, entre ellas las aulas del Centro de Convenciones Matteo Ricci con un aforo total para unas seiscientas personas.\n\nConforme a lo establecido en los Pactos de Letrán entre Italia y la Santa Sede, la Universidad Gregoriana, aun formando parte del territorio italiano (al igual que otros institutos pontificios), goza de las inmunidades reconocidas por el derecho internacional a las sedes diplomáticas extranjeras, correspondiendo su administración al Estado de la Ciudad del Vaticano.[1]\n\nLa Pontificia Universidad Gregoriana está asociada, por deseo expreso del papa Pío XI al Pontificio Instituto Bíblico y al Pontificio Instituto Oriental. Cada instituto permanece jurídicamente independiente con su propio rector, cuerpo docente y administración. Las tres instituciones cooperan estrechamente entre sí mediante el intercambio de profesores, la inscripción polivalente de los estudiantes y la propuesta en común de un gran número de cursos. De este modo, las tres instituciones ofrecen a sus alumnos una gran variedad de departamentos o facultades. Estas son:\n• Facultades\n• Ciencias sociales (especialidades: comunicación social, doctrina social de la Iglesia, sociología, liderazgo y gestión)\n• Historia y Patrimonio cultural de la Iglesia (especializaciones: historia de la Iglesia, patrimonio cultural de la Iglesia)\n• Institutos\n• Antropología (antiguo Centro para la protección de menores)\n• Centros\n• Centro de formadores al sacerdocio y a la vida consagrada \"San Pedro Fabro\"\n\nVarios Papas han estudiado en la Pontificia Universidad Gregoriana:\n\nTambién en la Gregoriana han estudiado san Óscar Romero, arzobispo de San Salvador, Ismael Perdomo, Monseñor arzobispo de Bogotá Colombia, y Fernando Lugo primero obispo y luego presidente del Paraguay (2008-2012).\n• Escudo de la Pontificia Universidad Gregoriana de Roma\n• La iglesia de San Ignacio: capilla del Antiguo Colegio Romano\n• None .

A menudo son citados como los equivalentes británicos a los Premios de la Academia estadounidense.[1]​[2]​[3]​ En 2008, los premios fueron entregados en la Royal Opera House de Londres, y han tenido lugar desde el año 2000 en el Odeon Cinema, situado en Leicester Square.\n\nLa BAFTA (sigla en inglés British Academy of Film and Television Arts) fue fundada en 1947 con el nombre de Academia Británica de Cinematografía. En 1958, la Academia se unió al Sindicato de Productores y Directores formando de esa manera la Sociedad de Cinematografía y Televisión, convirtiéndose en 1976 en la actual Academia Británica de las Artes Cinematográficas y de la Televisión.\n\nLa academia está compuesta, en su conjunto, de aproximadamente 6500 miembros que tienen como objetivo \"apoyar, motivar e inspirar a aquellos que trabajan en el cine, la televisión o el mundo de los videojuegos, identificando y premiando su excelencia, y educando a aquellos que hacen uso de cualquiera de estas formas de arte visual en movimiento\".\n\nEl premio que se otorga en estos premios es una escultura diseñada por el artista Mitzi Cunliffe y representa una máscara, el símbolo tradicional del teatro y la tragicomedia.\n\nLa ceremonia se celebraba anualmente entre los meses de abril y mayo, pero desde 2001 se trasladó a febrero para preceder a los Premios de la Academia (los Premios Óscar). Los premios están abiertos a todas las nacionalidades, excepto en dos categorías: La Mejor película británica y Mejor estrella debut. Solo las películas del Reino Unido son elegibles para las categorías de los premios British Short Film y British Short Animation.\n\nLa ceremonia de entrega de premios se retrasa la transmisión en la televisión británica la misma noche (generalmente en BBC One) y en todo el mundo. En los Estados Unidos se muestra en BBC America. Se ha emitido en color desde 1970.\n\nDurante cada ceremonia anual, BAFTA hace una pausa in memoriam para rendir homenaje a aquellos en la industria que han muerto en los últimos 12 meses, mostrando un montaje de imágenes acompañadas de música.\n\nLas últimas ceremonias han tenido lugar en la Royal Opera House, rompiendo la tradición establecida en 2000 de celebrar la ceremonia en el Odeon Cinema.\n\nHasta 2012, la red de telefonía móvil Orange patrocinó los premios. La empresa matriz de Orange, EE, se hizo cargo del patrocinio del evento a partir de 2013.\n• BAFTA a la mejor película (desde 1948)\n• BAFTA a la mejor película británica (en memoria de Alexander Korda) (desde 1948)\n• BAFTA a la mejor película de habla no inglesa (desde 1982)\n• BAFTA a la mejor película de animación (desde 2006)\n• BAFTA a la mejor serie preescolar (desde 2006)\n• Premios Óscar de la Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de Hollywood\n• Premios Globo de Oro de la Asociación de la Prensa Extranjera de Hollywood\n• Premios Goya de la Academia de las Artes y las Ciencias Cinematográficas de España\n• Premios César de la Academia de las Artes y Técnicas del Cine de Francia\n• Premios del Cine Europeo de la Academia de Cine Europeo\n• Premios Ariel de la Academia Mexicana de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas\n• Premios Cóndor de Plata de la Asociación de Cronistas Cinematográficos de la Argentina\n• Premios Sur de la Academia de las Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas de la Argentina\n• Premio Pedro Sienna del Consejo Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes (Chile)\n• Premio David de Donatello de la Academia del Cine Italiano\n• Premios León checo de la Academia Checa de Cine y Televisión\n• Palma de Oro del Festival de Cannes\n• Premios La Silla de la Asociación Dominicana de Profesionales de la Industria del CineAnexo:Óscar al mejor actor de reparto - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: El Óscar al mejor actor de reparto es uno de los premios otorgados por la Academia de Artes y Ciencias Cinematográficas de Estados Unidos —AMPAS— en reconocimiento a los actores secundarios con interpretaciones sobresalientes en alguna película del año anterior. Esta categoría fue creada en la novena ceremonia de premiación llevada a cabo en 1937, antes de ello, era el «Óscar al mejor actor» el que reconocía tanto a actores principales como de reparto. Mientras que los nominados a esta categoría son elegidos por actores y actrices miembros de la Academia, los ganadores son elegidos por todos los miembros en su totalidad. Hasta la 91.ª edición de los Óscar, 74 actores han ganado este premio. Durante muchos años, esta categoría se llamó Óscar al mejor actor secundario.\n\nEl más reciente acreedor al galardón fue el actor estadounidense Robert Downey Jr. por su excelente participación en Oppenheimer en el papel antagonístico de Lewis Strauss\n\nDesde que se creó la categoría en 1937, la AMPAS ha entregado un total de 76 estatuillas a 69 actores diferentes. Sin embargo, antes de la decimosexta ceremonia, los actores eran reconocidos con una placa. El primer actor en recibir este premio fue Walter Brennan, por su actuación 1 Rivales en 1937. Christopher Plummer es el ganador más anciano en esta categoría y uno de los más recientes.\n\nHasta la octava ceremonia celebrada en 1936, existía una sola categoría que premiaba a todos los actores por igual: el «Óscar al Mejor Actor». Pero esta parecía favorecer a los que estuvieran mayor tiempo en pantalla, por esto la AMPAS decidió introducir una categoría para los actores de reparto al año siguiente. Cabe reconocer que el ganador al mejor actor en 1931, Lionel Barrymore, logró la victoria con un claro papel de reparto. Igualmente, en 1935, Franchot Tone logró una nominación en la categoría con un papel en las mismas condiciones.\n\nDesde entonces y hasta la actualidad, un actor puede ser nominado por una actuación específica en una sola película, y dichas nominaciones no pueden pasar de cinco por año. Los premios de mejor actriz, mejor actor, mejor actriz de reparto y mejor actor de reparto son las únicas categorías de la Academia que califican actuación. Cabe recordar que, al igual que los demás premios de actuación, es presentado y entregado por el correspondiente ganador del año anterior del género opuesto, en este caso, por la última ganadora a Mejor Actriz de reparto.\n• La tabla muestra a los ganadores del «Óscar al mejor actor» desde el origen de los premios hasta la actualidad. El año representa al periodo de exhibición de la película, no la fecha de premiación, es decir, el ganador del año 1999 fue premiado en el año 2000, etc.\n• Walter Brennan con tres victorias (1936 - 1938 - 1940) y además siendo el primer galardonado en la categoría, es el actor más premiado de la categoría. Otros 7 actores han ganado el premio en dos ocasiones, ellos son: Anthony Quinn (1952 - 1956), Peter Ustinov (1960 - 1964), Jason Robards (1976 - 1977), Melvyn Douglas (1963 - 1979), Michael Caine (1986 - 1999), Christoph Waltz (2009 - 2012) y Mahershala Ali (2016 - 2018). Jason Robards es el único actor que ha ganado en años consecutivos.\n• Seis actores afroamericanos han ganado el premio, ellos son: Louis Gossett, Jr. (1982), Denzel Washington (1989), Cuba Gooding, Jr. (1996), Morgan Freeman (2004), Mahershala Ali (2016 - 2018) y Daniel Kaluuya (2020).\n• Claude Rains y Arthur Kennedy han sido los actores con más nominaciones y sin ninguna victoria, con 4 candidaturas cada uno. Otros actores con el mismo número de candidaturas son: Walter Brennan (ganador en tres ocasiones) y Jack Nicholson (ganador en una ocasión). Le siguen Charles Bickford, Jeff Bridges, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris y Al Pacino, con tres 3 candidaturas y sin ninguna victoria, sin embargo, Bridges, Duvall y Pacino ganaron el Óscar en la categoría de mejor actor.\n• El ganador de mayor edad es Christopher Plummer, quien fue premiado en 2011 por Beginners a los 82 años. Además, el mismo Plummer es también el actor de más edad en haber recibido una nominación en esta categoría; fue en 2017 por su papel en la película Todo el dinero del mundo. Tenía en ese momento 88 años.\n• El ganador más joven es Timothy Hutton, premiado en 1980 por Ordinary People, a los 20 años. El nominado más joven es Justin Henry, considerado para el Óscar en 1979 por Kramer vs. Kramer, a los 8 años.\n• En 1946, Harold Russell fue premiado con dos premios Óscar por su papel en la película Los mejores años de nuestra vida. El primero en esta categoría y el segundo, con un Óscar Honorífico. En 1944 se presentó una situación muy particular, Barry Fitgerald fue nominado en las categorías de mejor actor y mejor actor de reparto por el mismo papel en la cinta Going My Way, ganando el último. Actualmente, las reglas de la Academia impiden que esta situación vuelva a suceder.\n• En 1972, la película El padrino presentó la nominación de tres actores en la categoría, ellos fueron: Al Pacino, James Caan y Robert Duvall, pero todos perdieron frente a Joel Grey por Cabaret. Pacino boicoteó la ceremonia al ser nominado en la categoría de reparto y no en la principal ya que había aparecido más tiempo en pantalla que su colega Marlon Brando, ganador en la categoría de mejor actor y quien rechazó el premio. Otros actores nominados en la categoría por las secuelas de El padrino son: Robert De Niro (ganador en 1974), Michael V. Gazzo, Lee Strasberg y Andy García.\n• Heath Ledger ganó esta categoría de forma póstuma en 2008 por su papel de The Joker en The Dark Knight.\n• Dos actores han conseguido nominaciones al Óscar una como mejor actor y otra en esta categoría por interpretar un mismo personaje en películas distintas ellos son: Al Pacino por interpretar a Michael Corleone en las películas El padrino (1972) y El padrino II (1974) y Sylvester Stallone por interpretar a Rocky Balboa en las películas Rocky (1976) y Creed (2015).\n\nComo los Premios Óscar se realizan en los Estados Unidos y se centran en la industria cinematográfica de Hollywood, la mayoría de los ganadores han sido estadounidenses. Sin embargo, hay una presencia internacional significativa en los premios, como lo demuestra la siguiente lista:\n• Globo de Oro al mejor actor de reparto\n• Oscar.com (Sitio oficial de la ceremonia de premiación)\n• Lista completa descargable de los ganadores del ÓscarEl vergelità Enric Auquer guanya el Gaudí al millor actor secundari per 'Casa en flames': Foto: Jordi Borràs\n\n \n\n L'actor vergelità Enric Auquer aquest dissabte ha tornat a proclamar-se el Millor Actor Secundari a la Gala dels 17 Premis Gaudí. \n\n \n\n Aquest nou guardó que suma l'actor de Verges al seu palmarès del Premi Gaudí al millor actor secundari en aquesta ocasió el rep pel seu paper a la pel·lícula 'Casa en flames', dirigida per Dani de la Orden i que a més va estar gravada en molts indrets de la Costa Brava, com les platges de Begur o de Calella de Palafrugell.\n\n \n\n Aquesta pel·lícula arribava als 17 Premis Gaudí amb catorze nominacions. La de millor actor secundari n'era un, però també estava nominada, per exemple, a millor pel·lícula, direcció, guió original, actriu protagonista, millor actriu secundària o millor muntatge, entre altres. De totes les nominacions, 'Casa en Flames' també ha guanyat el Premi a Millor Guió Original i Millor Actriu Protagonista, per la interpretació d'Emma Vilarasau com a mare de la família. \n\n \n\n I Enric Auquer també tenia una altra nominació en aquesta Gala, en la categoria de millor interpretació protagonista masculí pel seu paper al film 'Mamífera'. \n\n \n\n D'altra banda, posant la vista enrere, Auquer ja s'havia endut el Gaudí a millor actor secundari l'any 2020 amb el film 'Quien a hierro mata'.

Consistent with decision IPCC/XLI-4, a preliminary Scoping meeting for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Synthesis Report (SYR) was held during the AR6 Scoping Meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 1 to 5 May 2017. The Panel at its 46th Session held from 6 to 10 September 2017 in Montreal, Canada, took note of document IPCC-XLVI/Doc.6 which was produced during the scoping meeting.\n\nA dedicated Scoping meeting for the AR6 Synthesis Report was held in Singapore from 21 to 23 October 2019, the outcome of which is included in the AR6 SYR Scoping document IPCC-LII/Doc.10 submitted to the 52nd session of the Panel. It is explained in more detail in the information document IPCC-LII/INF.12.\n\nThe Panel at its 52nd Session held in Paris, France from 24 to 28 February 2020 agreed to the outline of the AR6 SYR as is contained in Annex 1 to Decision IPCC-LII-10.\n\nThe SYR outline agreed at the 52nd Panel Session of the IPCC consists of an introduction and three main sections arranged by timeframes. The first section, ‘Current Status and Trends’, covers the historical and present period. The second section, ‘Long-term Climate and Development Futures’, addresses projected futures up to 2100 and beyond. The final section is ‘Near-term Responses in a Changing Climate’, considers current international policy timeframes, and the time interval between now and 2030-2040.\n\nThis structure, substantially different to what was adopted for AR5 SYR, enables a holistic framing that integrates across the Working Groups, better enabling the SYR to cover different aspects of climate change.Credits for new clean vehicles purchased in 2023 or after | Internal Revenue Service: If you place in service a new plug-in electric vehicle (EV) or fuel cell vehicle (FCV) in 2023 or after, you may qualify for a clean vehicle tax credit.

It does not project on a screen, but provides viewing to only one person at a time. Circa 1900, the mutoscope dominated the coin-in-the-slot “peep-show” business. A mutoscope works on the same principle as the “flip book.” Individual image frames are conventional black-and-white, silver-based photographic prints on tough, flexible opaque cards. Rather than being bound into a booklet, the cards are attached to a circular core, like a huge Rolodex. A reel typically holds about 850 cards, giving a viewing time of about a minute. A patron views the cards through a single lens enclosed by a hood. The cards might be lit electrically, but the reel is driven by means of a geared-down hand crank. Each machine holds a single reel and is dedicated to a short show, described by a poster affixed to the machine."}

La seva vida va canviar quan va conèixer a Malcolm McLaren i va entrar sobtadament en el món de l’art, la política i la llibertat. Junts van obrir una botiga de roba al número 430 de King Road. En la dècada de 1970 la seva botiga es va convertir en un referent per al moviment punk i va vestir les bandes de punk més famoses de l’època. Amb el temps va establir la seva pròpia identitat com a dissenyadora de moda. Va crear un imperi de la moda, amb peces clau que van revolucionar els estils i teixits tradicionals, com el tartan, el tweed, la crinolina, les cotilles i les peces de punt. Vivienne també és una activista del canvi climàtic. El seu lema és «Compra menys, tria bé i fes que duri». En 2006 va ser nomenada Comendadora de l’Ordre de l’Imperi Britànic i des d’aleshores se la coneix com la «gran dama de l’costura anglesa». Actualment dissenya roba perquè la gent se senti «gran i forta», sigui qui sigui.\n\nUna col·lecció de contes amb la qual nens i nenes descobriran qui eren i què van aconseguir les dones més importants de la història contemporània. Dissenyadores, pintores, aventureres, escriptores, científiques… Dones úniques i meravelloses de qui aprendre i identificar-se. Dones que, com la Vivienne, van convertir un petit somni en una gran història.Watch 1922 | Netflix Official Site: A farmer pens a confession admitting to his wife's murder, but her death is just the beginning of a macabre tale.

The scenery is probably my favorite part and the story in general, and just the way it was filmed and the song placement and choice is just amazing. Thomas Jane nailed his part, I also liked the metaphor about being trapped like a rat in your own head, but that was not enough to save this slow burn boring movie. Great atmosphere. The ending could have been a bit stronger, I think. Still, a solid movie experience and exploration of characters and issues! Pretty good scenes and graphics. Plot was really good just had a few holes. Like he got a job at an old age with no hand but yet his son couldn’t get a job better than thieving? He ran away bc of the guilt of the crime but he wasn’t a suspect. Seems his death and the pregnant girlfriend is on Henry. Even if he ran away bc his girl was pregnant, would have done the same thing before him and his wife moved. Seems there was never another way for Henry as well as his decisions are based around his girlfriend. Better way should have been for the mom to realize her child is born and used to that area and doesn’t want to move. Not to mention her husband wanted to stay as well. If you didn’t, shoulda thought about that before marriage; property location all prior to conceiving a child as a child shouldn’t be moved around anyways unless necessary. To a child, life is happiness not money and maybe it is again when we are almost out of it. Honestly it isn't so bad but I expected way more and the ending was cliché. Some people say this is a slow movie and that “it’s too boring” but they are wrong, this movie is a masterpiece, every minute is tense and amazing. Don’t let the poor reviews bother you, this is well worth your time."}

Muchas gracias!!!Narrador - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: El narrador es la voz que cuenta y relata sucesos, historias o anécdotas.\n• Narrativa: La principal, ya que el narrador define por su actividad de contar una historia, dice cómo suceden los hechos en la narración.\n• De Control: Señala la capacidad del narrador para incidir en su propio discurso desde un plano metanarrativo.\n• Comunicativa: Incluye las funciones que se refieren directamente al destinatario (el lector), apelativa y fática, e implica que el narrador se comporta como un hablante que se dirige a un interlocutor tratando de influir en él.\n• Testimonial: A través de ella el narrador se refiere a sus fuentes de información, la mayor o menor nitidez de los recuerdos, etc.\n• Ideológica (aunque no es exclusiva del narrador la expresión o valoración ideológica).\n\nEn el caso del narrador en primera persona (narrador interno o protagonista), el narrador es un personaje dentro de la historia (intradiegético): actúa, juzga y tiene opiniones sobre los hechos y los personajes que aparecen. En este caso, el narrador sólo tiene y aporta información basada en su propia visión de los eventos. Un ejemplo de narración intradiegético:\n\nEste narrador es el que más se diferencia del propio autor: es un personaje en la obra, que tiene necesariamente que cumplir con todas las normas de ser un personaje, incluso cuando esté cumpliendo tareas de narrador. Para que tenga conocimiento de algo, por lo tanto, es necesario que lo experimente con sus propios sentidos, o que algún otro personaje se lo cuente. Puede contar sus propios pensamientos y opiniones, pero no los de los demás personajes, a no ser que los conozca por cualquier motivo.\n\nEl narrador en primera persona puede ser el propio protagonista de la historia (como Gulliver en Los Viajes de Gulliver), alguien muy cercano a él y que conoce sus pensamientos y acciones (como el Dr. Watson en los cuentos de Sherlock Holmes), o algún personaje marginal que tenga poco que ver con los hechos que se narran.\n• Narrador-protagonista. El narrador-protagonista cuenta su propia historia. Es el personaje principal y todo lo que sucede lo sabemos a través de él. El narrador en primera persona (yo) adopta un punto de vista subjetivo que le hace identificarse con el protagonista y le impide interpretar de forma absoluta e imparcial los pensamientos y acciones de los restantes personajes de la narración. Es el tipo de narrador que se utiliza en géneros como el diario o la autobiografía.\n• Narrador testigo. El narrador testigo es un espectador del acontecer, un personaje que asume la función de narrar. Pero no es el protagonista de la historia, sino un personaje secundario. Cuenta la historia en la que participa o interviene desde su punto de vista, como alguien que la ha vivido desde fuera, pero que es parte del mundo del relato. Ejemplo de este narrador son los cuentos de Sherlock Holmes.\n• Monólogo interior. El monólogo interior introduce una reflexión que raya en la disertación sobre un tema (no se debe confundir con el stream of consciousness o como flujo de conciencia) es la técnica literaria que trata de reproducir los mecanismos del pensamiento en el texto, tales como la asociación de ideas. Ejemplos notorios aparecen en la obra de Marcel Proust en el monólogo de la magdalena; el flujo de consciencia es propio de las obras de Virginia Woolf y James Joyce.\n\nEs el tipo de narrador menos utilizado. Tiene las características del narrador intradiegético porque suele contar su propia historia. Es un tipo de narrador que busca la complicidad del lector. Por eso se dirige constantemente a él. Aunque utiliza los paradigmas de segunda persona, es decir, “tú”, “te”, “a ti”, \"ustedes\", etc. El personaje desdobla su personalidad y habla consigo mismo como si lo hiciera con otro. Es también el narrador que suele contar los acontecimientos de su vida.\n\n“Usted ha de amar el bello armario de su dormitorio, con la gran puerta que se abre generosa, las tablas vacías a la espera de mi ropa. Ahora los tengo ahí. Ahí dentro. Verdad que parece imposible; ni Sara lo creería.” (Carta a una señorita en París, Julio Cortázar). [1]​\n\nEl narrador en tercera persona o narrador externo se encuentra (en la mayoría de los casos) fuera de la historia, por lo que también se conoce como narrador extradiegético. Aquí la voz narrativa se dirige a uno o a varios personajes de forma directa.\n\nSin embargo, pueden distinguirse tres tipos de narrador en tercera persona, según el conocimiento que tienen del mundo creado por el autor.\n\nEl narrador omnisciente o directivo es quien conoce a detalle la historia. Conoce todo respecto de la narración. Puede influir en el lector, pero no siempre. Trata de ser objetivo en lo que dice o piensa. Las características principales del narrador omnisciente son que: expone y comenta las actuaciones de los personajes y los acontecimientos que se van desarrollando en la narración; se interna en los personajes y les cuenta a los lectores los pensamientos más íntimos que cruzan por sus mentes, sus estados de ánimo y sentimientos; posee el don de la ubicuidad, dominando la totalidad de la narración y parece saber lo que va a ocurrir en el futuro y lo que ocurrió en el pasado; utiliza la tercera persona del singular o plural.\n\nEl narrador testigo está incluido en la narración, pero en este caso no es parte de ella, sólo cuenta lo que ve, en calidad de testigo, sin participar directamente en los acontecimientos. Narra en primera persona y en tercera las acciones de otros personajes, además siempre se incluye dentro de la narración, pero sólo como un observador.[2]​\n\nEste personaje sólo narra lo que presencia y ve. Se trata pues de un narrador testigo, que nos cuenta la historia en tercera persona (él no es el protagonista), pero desde un punto de vista concreto, ya que la ha presenciado de primera mano. Pero el narrador testigo no siempre es como el que nos encontramos en esta obra de Eco, sino que puede estar más o menos cerca de la acción, divisarla a lo lejos, presenciarla desde dentro, espiarla, etcétera. [Eso sí, siempre se trata de un personaje que observa la escena y nos la cuenta haciendo pocas alusiones a sí mismo.\n\nExisten muchos tipos distintos de narradores testigos, cada uno con sus particularidades. Algunos de los más usados son los siguientes:\n• Testigo impersonal: Está determinado por la fotografía y el cine, ya que nos da la mirada de una cámara. Casi siempre en tiempo presente, se limita a contar lo que se ve. Como ejemplo de este tipo de narrador, tenemos La Colmena de Camilo José Cela.\n• Testigo presencial: Narra los hechos ocurridos tiempo atrás que él (o ella) presenció en persona. Como ejemplos de este tipo de narrador tenemos al conocido Doctor Watson, ayudante del detective Sherlock Holmes, o a Íñigo Balboa de Las aventuras del capitán Alatriste por Arturo Pérez-Reverte, quien recuerda las aventuras que vivió cuando era un muchacho junto al Capitán Alatriste.\n• El informante: Cuenta la historia transcribiendo los hechos como si se tratase de un documento oficial o una crónica, presentándolos como auténticos. El informe de Brodie de Jorge Luis Borges\n\nEl narrador protagonista cuenta su historia en primera persona con sus palabras, centrándose siempre en él mismo.[2]​ Es el poseedor de la situación, organiza hechos y expresa criterios como le conviene. También puede ser una autobiografía hecha por este.\n\nUn narrador protagonista es un tipo de narrador que asume un papel primario a la hora de contar una historia. Dentro de la narración, el papel del narrador es muy relevante, ya que es la voz encargada de transmitirnos la historia en cuestión.\n\nEste narrador se identifica con un personaje determinado y conoce sólo aquello que conoce el personaje o aquello que a éste le han contado. El autor es una persona real, que vive o vivió en determinada época y no puede relatar lo que sucedió antes o después de que él estuviera vivo, y aun así, sólo podría relatar lo que él personalmente haya vivido o entendido sobre determinado asunto, ni más ni menos. Usa la tercera persona, voz narrativa que favorece siempre el objetivismo. Un ejemplo actual y bastante extremo de esta modalidad es la novela El Infierno Y Los Celacantos, de César Fuentes Rodríguez.\n\nRelata sus experiencias como personaje central de la historia. Para que tenga conocimiento de algo, por lo tanto, es necesario que lo experimente con sus propios sentidos, o que algún otro personaje se lo cuente. Puede contar sus propios pensamientos y opiniones, pero no los de los demás personajes, a no ser que estos se lo cuenten. Este narrador es el que más se diferencia del propio autor: Es un personaje en la obra, que tiene necesariamente que cumplir con todas las normas de ser un personaje, incluso cuando esté cumpliendo tareas de narrador.\n\nEl narrador deficiente conoce \"menos que el protagonista\" acerca de la historia. Registra únicamente lo que puede ser visto y oído, sin penetrar en la mente de ninguno de los personajes. Por esta razón, este tipo de narrador puede recibir también el nombre de narrador objetivo, porque no incluye ninguna subjetividad en su narración (ni suya ni de ningún personaje).\n\nEste narrador, por lo tanto, es un mero testigo de los hechos que acontecen en la narración, y es el más utilizado en la narración periodística.\n\nEl enfoque narrativo múltiple o la perspectiva múltiple se da cuando dos o más personajes se refieren a los mismos hechos, pero desde distintos puntos de vista, interpretándolos de distinta manera, combinando varios de los tipos de relación que tiene el narrador directamente con el relato y el recurso literario y expresivo utilizado para contar la historia. Un buen ejemplo es la novela Rosaura a las diez de Marco Denevi.[3]​\n\nEl narrador heterodiegético o extradiegético cuenta la historia externamente, sin tener nada que ver con los hechos relatados. El narrador intradiegético, que cumple únicamente con la función de narrar, lo podemos identificar a través de marcas dentro de la historia. Encontramos también al narrador homodiegético, cuentan la historia desde su participación en ella, dentro de este tipo de narrador podemos encontrar una subclasificación como narrador protagonista (autodiegético), quien es el que cuenta su experiencia directamente; y el narrador testigo (metadiegético) que pertenece al mundo del relato, pero cuenta la historia como alguien que la ha vivido desde fuera.\n\nEste enfoque es el que corresponde a un narrador particularmente imparcial, objetivo, ecuánime, que en estilo enciclopédico describe un concepto, un hecho, un personaje, una biografía, o una obra.\n• None Teoría de la narrativa: una perspectiva sistemática en Teoría de la narrativa: una perspectiva sistemática] .

Tus ojos vigilan cada movimiento que hago. Me juzgan con la mirada, como si quisieran que fracasara. Tus ojos me amenazan, analizan cada una de mis palabras, ridiculizan mis movimientos, se ríen de mis expresiones faciales. Son ojos desde los que mi padre me miraba de manera condescendiente y me criticaba constantemente; él también esperaba que fracasara, solo para tener la razón. Tus ojos me perforan como un cuchillo, como si estuvieras descubriendo un placer violento y perverso al verme tan ridículo.”\n\nSi yo fuera un narrador en primera persona en una historia que se centra en mis descripciones de otros personajes y de los eventos en la trama, lo que acabo de decir sería un buen ejemplo de la técnica literaria llamada el narrador poco fiable o sospechoso. Fíjate que, en los detalles de mis percepciones, he revelado algunos problemas en cuanto a la relación con mi padre; y es más, las he proyectado hacia ti como si fueran la verdad objetiva de cómo me estás mirando. Mis percepciones de ti se convierten ahora en la realidad de la narración de mi historia, pero es muy posible que se alejen de la realidad de cómo me estás mirando tú ahora desde tu pantalla. Como narrador, no estaría tratando de ofrecer a mi audiencia hechos objetivos de una realidad reconocible, sino mis percepciones e interpretaciones sumamente influenciadas, dadas sin ningún tipo de corroboración factual o de terceros para demostrar que son ciertas, o incluso para sugerir que soy consciente de mis prejuicios personales.\n\nImagina por un momento que eres un autor que quiere escribir una historia en primera persona y usas este modo de narración. Parte de la razón por la que eliges este estilo narrativo no es solo porque quieres que tu audiencia entienda que la realidad de una persona es en parte siempre subjetiva (como en la famosa frase “la belleza está en los ojos del que mira”), pero porque quieres que tu audiencia no solo capte cómo los pensamientos y las descripciones del narrador reflejan cómo ve el mundo, pero también por qué lo ve de esa manera. Al poner en boca de tu narrador detectables repeticiones, exageraciones, patrones de pensamiento, y especialmente percepciones simbólicas, tu historia, a través de este narrador, trataría tanto sobre la psicología del narrador como de los eventos que cuenta. Para conseguir esto podrías hacer que el narrador diera información sobre quién es, dónde ha crecido o vivido, y por qué el evento en particular que están relatando le ha llevado a contar la historia. Mientras el lector escucha a ese narrador y nota esos patrones, puede que él mismo empiece a meterse en el papel de un terapeuta, pendiente de escuchar pistas y señales en la narración que apuntan a por qué la voz narrativa percibe y describe cosas de la forma en que lo hace."}

El extremo de 27 años, quien también puede actuar como volante central, refuerza la plantilla de Inter Miami de cara a la tercera temporada del club en la MLS.\n\n“Robert es un jugador habilidoso, emocionante, creador de oportunidades que nos brinda opciones en ataque ya que puede sobresalir en distintos roles, ya sea como extremo o como mediocampista central.

Ha jugado 24 veces para su país hasta la fecha, incluyendo el haber competido en partidos de las eliminatorias de la UEFA para la Copa Mundial, eliminatorias para el Campeonato Europeo de la UEFA y la Liga de Naciones de la UEFA, registrando un gol y dos asistencias. Taylor también fue parte de la histórica nómina de Finlandia para el Campeonato Europeo de la UEFA 2020, ya que fue la primera ocasión en la que el equipo participó en el certamen continental.\n\nTaylor comenzó su carrera desarrollándose como jugador en las categorías inferiores del equipo finlandés JJK Jyväskylä, primero uniéndose al club en el 2004. Luego se fue al Lincoln City en Inglaterra con una beca de dos años en el 2011, antes de regresar a su natal Finlandia en el 2013 para convertirse en jugador del primer equipo del JJK.\n\nDisputó 56 cotejos en todas las competiciones con el JJK a lo largo de las siguientes tres temporadas, contribuyendo con 11 goles, antes de unirse al también equipo finlandés Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS) en el 2016 para dar el salto a la primera división del país. Entre el 2016 y 2017, el atacante versátil sumó 56 apariciones con el equipo en todas las competiciones, incluyendo cuatro en duelos de las rondas clasificatorias para la UEFA Europa League, registrando 19 tantos y nueve asistencias en el proceso.\n\nEn el verano del 2017, Taylor fue traspasado al AIK Fotboll de la primera división de Suecia.

Jere Eremenko, quien jugó en su juventud por Jaro, forma un nuevo equipo con jugadores locales y consigue a préstamo dos jugadores de experiencia internacional su propio hijo \"Losha\" y el sudafricano Zezé.\n\nEl equipo Jaro tiene una temporada 2010 bastante exitosa en comparación al 2009 y está luchando por una medalla a cuatro partidos que termine el campeonato.Expectación entorno al debut de la selección finlandesa masculina de fútbol en la Eurocopa: El 12 de junio de 2021 la selección masculina de fútbol de Finlandia jugará en Copenhague su partido inaugural de la Eurocopa 2020 contra Dinamarca. Aunque la frase sea fácil de escribir, muchos hinchas del fútbol finlandés aún tienen que pellizcarse para creérselo.\n\nSe trata de la primera participación de la selección masculina en un gran torneo internacional, algo que para muchos aficionados constituye la culminación de décadas de esperanzas y expectativas.\n\nEn 2020, en conmemoración del 60º aniversario del torneo, la Eurocopa hubiera debido celebrarse en 13 ciudades europeas, siendo la primera vez que se programaba en más de dos países anfitriones. Con un año de retraso a causa de la pandemia, todas las sedes, excepto Dublín y Bilbao, permanecen en el calendario. El estadio londinense de Wembley acogerá las semifinales, así como la gran final, el 11 de julio. La entidad organizadora, la UEFA, confía en que al menos nueve de los estadios anfitriones puedan acoger a los espectadores, en mayor o menor medida. Un alivio, si se tiene en cuenta que durante el periodo de la pandemia la mayoría de los partidos celebrados en el continente han tenido que disputarse en estadios vacíos.\n\nUno de ellos es el Parken Stadion de Copenhague, que aspira acoger a 12 000 espectadores (un lleno total representaría 38 000) cuando el 12 de junio Finlandia se estrene en su primer partido del Grupo B. Tanto si están presentes ese día, como si lo ven desde sus casas, los aficionados van a estar sencillamente encantados de que tras décadas de fracasos y frustraciones Finlandia por fin haya logrado llegar a un torneo, y tampoco van a amilanarse ante la fuerza de los rivales del grupo, en el que están Bélgica –actualmente la mejor selección nacional del mundo, según la FIFA– y Rusia, así como por Dinamarca, que fue campeona en 1992.\n\nLos hinchas finlandeses que tengan la suerte de poder asistir a los partidos no tendrán que viajar muy lejos, ya que los encuentros con Bélgica y Rusia se disputarán en el Estadio Krestovsky de San Petersburgo, justo al otro lado de la frontera oriental de Finlandia, mientras que Copenhague, la vecina nórdica, solo está a dos horas de vuelo de Helsinki.\n\nBajo la dirección de Markku Kanerva, su seleccionador, el equipo finlandés se aseguró la clasificación en el segundo puesto de su grupo, por detrás de Italia, y sus jugadores han ido compenetrándose admirablemente a medida que avanzaba la campaña, espoleados por el máximo goleador del grupo, Teemu Pukki, con diez goles en su haber. Finlandia espera fervientemente que Pukki se recupere a tiempo de la lesión sufrida a finales de temporada durante un partido con su equipo, el Norwich City –ganador del Campeonato de la Liga Inglesa de Fútbol–, y pueda participar en la Eurocopa.\n\nNo cabe duda de que Pukki es una máquina de marcar goles, pero este no es un equipo de un solo hombre y su sólido espíritu de cohesión es uno de sus puntos fuertes. Cuando el finlandés Glen Kamara –que juega en los Glasgow Rangers, el equipo campeón de Escocia– sufrió insultos racistas durante un partido de su club contra el Slavia de Praga, sus compañeros finlandeses no tardaron en apoyarle luciendo camisetas con el mensaje “Estamos con Glen”, y el capitán de la selección de Finlandia, Tim Sparv, hizo declaraciones de apoyo similares en los medios de comunicación.\n\nYa en un tono más desenfadado, el chiste que circula por Irlanda es que Finlandia tiene el único irlandés de todo el torneo. Y es que Irlanda no se ha clasificado, pero el defensa finlandés Daniel O’Shaughnessy tiene la doble nacionalidad, porque su padre es irlandés.\n\nCerramos este artículo con una curiosidad futbolística: el partido contra Bélgica tal vez les recuerde otro encuentro de clasificación para la Eurocopa, que se celebró en junio de 2007 entre estos dos mismos equipos en el Estadio Olímpico de Helsinki, y durante el cual el árbitro tuvo que parar el partido varios minutos porque un búho gigante, al que más tarde se llamó Bubi, se abalanzó sobre la portería belga, para regocijo de los hinchas finlandeses. Desde entonces, la selección nacional masculina de Finlandia lleva el apodo “los Búhos” (Huuhkajat, en finés). Finlandia obtuvo la victoria por 2 a 0.Football Club Honka Espoo - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: El Football Club Honka Espoo, popularmente llamado Honka, es un club de fútbol finlandés, con sede en Tapiola, Espoo. En la temporada 2005 ascendió a la primera división finlandesa (Veikkausliiga) por primera vez en su historia. Juega sus partidos de casa en el Tapiolan Urheilupuisto y su entrenador actual es Mika Lehkosuo. Originalmente fundado en 1953 como Tapion Honka cambió su nombre a FC Honka en 1975. FC Honka es conocido en Finlandia por su gran trabajo de cantera con más de 1000 jóvenes jugando en las distintas categorías.\n\nHasta el año 2005 al FC Honka se le consideraba como un eterno aspirante, siempre por debajo de su potencial en la Segunda División Finlandesa (Ykkönen). A finales de los años 1990 el objetivo era el ascenso pero año tras año sin éxito. A comienzos del siglo XXI FC Honka casi quiebra, pero finalmente se salvó.\n\nEn 2005 el club fue adquirido por Jouko Pakarinen y Jouko Harjunpää, que decían tener un plan para convertir FC Honka en aspirante a la Liga de Campeones de la UEFA. En el primer año de su toma de posesión la gestión tuvo éxito y tras diseñar un equipo competitivo FC Honka ganó la Segunda División (Ykkönen) con facilidad; alcanzando además las semifinales de la Copa Finlandesa donde finalmente cayó 1-0 ante el FC Haka.\n\nFC Honka obtuvo su mayor logro en 2008 al alcanzar por primera vez en su historia la Primera Ronda de la Copa de la UEFA tras eliminar en las clasificatorias al ÍA Akranes islandés y al Viking Stavanger noruego.\n\nFinalmente cayó en esta Primera Ronda ante el Racing de Santander español. El primer partido, en el Sardinero de Santander se saldó con 1-0 a favor de los locales el 18 de septiembre, y en el segundo el 2 de octubre en el Finnair Stadium de Helsinki volvieron a ganar los racinguistas por 0-1.\n• enlace roto disponible en Internet Archive ; véase el historial , la primera versión y la última ).Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi - HJK.fi: Mehiläinen ja HJK jatkavat hyvin toimivaa yhteistyötään.

El impacto visual del IKB se debe a su fuerte relación con el azul ultramar, así como a los espesores y texturas de esta pintura que Klein solía aplicar sobre sus lienzos.\n\nLa particularidad de este pigmento está en el tono azul puro y muy intenso, sin ningún indicio de verde, morado o gris.[1]​\n\nEl color International Klein Blue (IKB) fue desarrollado por Yves Klein en colaboración con Edouard Adam, un proveedor de pintura de arte parisino cuya tienda todavía se mantiene en el Bulevar Edgar Quinet en el barrio de Montparnasse en París.[2]​ La singularidad del IKB no se deriva de su pigmento, sino del aglutinante de resina sintética mate en el que se suspende el color, y que permite que el pigmento mantenga de la mejor manera posible la mayor de sus cualidades originales: su intensidad cromática.[3]​ La resina sintética usada en el aglutinante es un acetato de polivinilo desarrollado y comercializado en su momento bajo el nombre de \"RHODOPAS M\" o \"M60A\" por la compañía farmacéutica francesa Rhône-Poulenc.[1]​ Adam sigue vendiendo el aglutinante bajo el nombre[2]​ \"Médium Adam 25\".\n\nEn mayo de 1960, Klein depositó un enveloppe Soleau en el registro con la fórmula de la pintura, bajo el nombre de International Klein Blue (IKB) en el Instituto Nacional de la Propiedad Industrial de Francia (INPI),[3]​ pero nunca patentó el IKB. Según la legislación francesa, un enveloppe Soleau sirve solamente para registrar la fecha de una invención, de acuerdo con el depositante, con anterioridad a cualquier solicitud de patente legal. La copia en poder del INPI fue destruida en 1965, pero la propia copia de Klein, que el INPI le entregó debidamente sellada en su momento, sigue existiendo.[4]​\n\nEn marzo de 1960, Klein patentó un método mediante el que fue capaz de distanciarse de la creación física de sus pinturas, registrando un procedimiento de decoración basado en las marcas dejadas sobre una superficie por unas modelos recubiertas de pintura, cuyos movimientos dirigía.[5]​\n\nAunque Klein había trabajado con azul extensamente en su carrera anterior, no fue hasta 1958 cuando lo utilizó como el componente central de una pieza (convirtiendo el color en sí mismo de forma efectiva en una técnica). Klein se embarcó en una serie de obras monocromáticas utilizando IKB como tema central. En estas performances artísticas, Klein componía sus pinturas utilizando las marcas dejadas por modelos desnudas con sus cuerpos totalmente impregnados de pintura, a las que hacía caminar, enrollarse y estirarse sobre lienzos en blanco, así como lienzos de un solo color más convencionales. Seis de sus esculturas ejecutadas en IKB se exponen en el Musiktheater im Revier de Gelsenkirchen, Alemania.\n• El artista croata Anto Jerković se inspiró en Yves Klein y sus monocromas.\n• El actor ganador de un Premio Óscar Eddie Redmayne escribió su disertación sobre el IKB cuando estudió Historia del Arte en el Trinity College, Cambridge. 6 ​\n• En la novela de 2010 Zero History de William Gibson, el personaje Hubertus Bigend tiene un traje hecho con material de IKB. En la novela el personaje comenta que lleva este traje porque la intensidad del color con frecuencia hace que otras personas se sientan incómodas, y porque se divierte con la dificultad de reproducir el color en un monitor de ordenador.\n• Yves Klein Blue, una banda de rock australiana, toma su nombre del color.\n• En 1982 la banda de rock danés Kliché lanzó un instrumental titulado Internacional Klein Blue.\n• International Klein Blue es el color utilizado por Blue Man Group. 7 ​\n• El episodio 14 de la segunda temporada de la serie Mike Tyson Mysteries se titula \"Yves Klein Blues\": el excampeón de boxeo pretende utilizar el color en su chándal de verano. 8 ​\n\nEl color Websafe[9]​ equivalente, de forma que es reconocido correctamente por la mayoría de sistemas web, tiene los parámetros siguientes:[10]​\n• SFMOMA | Colecciones de Acceso en Línea | Yves Klein | IKB74\n• \"En todas partes, International Klein Blue\" por Jude Stewart, Print, 26 de octubre de 2010‘IKB 79‘, Yves Klein, 1959: This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Home: We would love for you to stop by and say hi but please be aware that we are limiting the personnel onsite and requiring all visitors to follow the county and state COVID-19 requirements and recommendations.\n\nCalling ahead is recommended.

The NFKB complex is inhibited by I-kappa-B proteins (NFKBIA or NFKBIB, MIM 604495), which inactivate NF-kappa-B by trapping it in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of serine residues on the I-kappa-B proteins by kinases (IKBKA, MIM 600664, or IKBKB, MIM 603258) marks them for destruction via the ubiquitination pathway, thereby allowing activation of the NF-kappa-B complex.

Early Christian Theologian & Scholar | Britannica: Origen was born of pagan parents, according to the Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry, but of Christian parents, according to the ecclesiastical historian Eusebius of Caesarea, whose account is probably more accurate. Eusebius stated that Origen’s father, Leonides, was martyred in the persecution of 202, so that Origen had to provide for his mother and six younger brothers. At first he lived in the house of a wealthy lady. He then earned money by teaching grammar and lived a life of strenuous asceticism. Eusebius added that he was a pupil of Clement of Alexandria, whom he succeeded as head of the Catechetical school under the authority of the bishop Demetrius. Eusebius also alleged that Origen, as a young man, castrated himself so as to work freely in instructing female catechumens; but this was not the only story told by the malicious about his extraordinary chastity, and thus it may merely have been hostile gossip. Eusebius’ account of Origen’s life, moreover, bears the embellishments of legends of saints and needs to be treated with this in mind. According to Porphyry, Origen attended lectures given by Ammonius Saccas, the founder of Neoplatonism. A letter of Origen mentions his “teacher of philosophy,” at whose lectures he met Heraclas, who was to become his junior colleague, then his rival, and who was to end as bishop of Alexandria refusing to hold communion with him. Origen invited Heraclas to assist him with the elementary teaching at the Catechetical school, leaving himself free for advanced teaching and study. During this period (from c. 212), Origen learned Hebrew and began to compile his Hexapla. A wealthy Christian named Ambrose, whom Origen converted from the teachings of the heretical Valentinus and to whom he dedicated many of his works, provided him with shorthand writers. A stream of treatises and commentaries began to pour from Origen’s pen. At Alexandria he wrote Miscellanies (Stromateis), On the Resurrection (Peri anastaseos), and On First Principles (De principiis). He also began his immense commentary on St. John, written to refute the commentary of the Gnostic follower of Valentinus, Heracleon. His studies were interrupted by visits to Rome (where he met the theologian Hippolytus), Arabia, Antioch, and Palestine. Because of his reputation, Origen was much in demand as a preacher, a circumstance that provoked the disapproval of Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria, who was anxious to control this free lay teacher and especially angry when Origen was allowed to preach at Caesarea Palestinae. In about 229–230 Origen went to Greece to dispute with another follower of Valentinus, Candidus. On the way he was ordained presbyter at Caesarea. The Valentinian doctrine that salvation and damnation are predestinate, independent of volition, was defended by Candidus on the ground that Satan is beyond repentance; Origen replied that if Satan fell by will, even he can repent. Demetrius, incensed at Origen’s ordination, was appalled by such a doctrinal view and instigated a synodical condemnation, which, however, was not accepted in Greece and Palestine. Thenceforth, Origen lived at Caesarea, where he attracted many pupils. One of his most notable students was Gregory Thaumaturgus, later bishop of Neocaesarea. From Caesarea, Origen continued his travels. In 235 the persecution of Maximinus found him in Cappadocia, from which he addressed to Ambrose his Exhortation to Martyrdom. During this period falls the “Discussion with Heracleides,” a papyrus partially transcribing a debate at a church council (probably in Arabia) where a local bishop was suspected of denying the preexistence of the divine Word and where obscure controversies raged over Christological issues and whether the soul is, in actuality, blood. During the persecution under the emperor Decius (250), Origen was imprisoned and tortured but survived to die several years later. His tomb at Tyre was held in honour, and its long survival is attested by historians of the period of the Crusades.\n\nOrigen’s main lifework was on the text of the Greek Old Testament and on the exposition of the whole Bible. The Hexapla was a synopsis of Old Testament versions: the Hebrew and a transliteration, the Septuagint (an authoritative Greek version of the Old Testament), the versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion and, for the Psalms, two further translations (one being discovered by him in a jar in the Jordan Valley). The purpose of the Hexapla was to provide a secure basis for debate with rabbis to whom the Hebrew alone was authoritative. Origen’s exegetical writings consist of commentaries (scholarly expositions for instructed Christians), homilies for mixed congregations, and scholia (detached comments on particular passages or books). All extant manuscripts of the commentary on St. John, which extended to 32 books, depend on a codex preserved in Munich containing only a few of the books. This codex and a related manuscript at Trinity College, Cambridge, are the sole witnesses for the Greek original of books 10–17 of his commentary on St. Matthew. Greek fragments of this, as of most of Origen’s exegetical works, survive in writings known as catenae (“chains”; i.e., anthologies of comments by early Church Fathers on biblical books). Commentaries on the Song of Solomon and on Romans survive in a drastically abbreviated Latin paraphrase by the Christian writer Tyrannius Rufinus (c. 365–410/411). The homilies on Genesis through the Book of Judges (except Deuteronomy) and Psalms 36–38 survive in a Latin translation by Rufinus. Jerome, the great Christian scholar (c. 347–c. 420), translated homilies on the Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Luke. These Latin homilies were widely read in medieval monasteries and have a rich manuscript tradition. The Greek original of homilies on Jeremiah survives in a single manuscript in the Escorial (Spain), and that of a homily on the witch of Endor (which provoked early criticism for its thesis that Samuel really was conjured up) in a manuscript in Munich and on papyrus. Prior to 231 Origen wrote De principiis, an ordered statement of Christian doctrine on an ambitious scale, based on the presupposition that every Christian is committed to the rule of faith laid down by the Apostles (the Creator as God of both Old and New Testaments, the incarnation of the preexistent Lord, the Holy Spirit as one of the divine triad, the freedom of rational souls, discarnate spirits, the noneternity of the world, judgment to come) but that outside this restriction the educated believer is free to speculate. Origen was writing long before the conciliar definitions of Chalcedon (451) concerning the Trinity and the Person of Christ and at a period when a far larger area of doctrine could be regarded as open for discussion and argument than was the case by 400. De principiis diverged in its speculations from later standards of orthodoxy. The original was consequently lost and can only be reconstructed from the Philocalia (an anthology compiled by Basil the Great and Gregory of Nazianzus illustrating Origen’s biblical interpretation), from Rufinus’ Latin paraphrase (which avowedly rewrites heterodox-sounding passages), and from later writers, notably Jerome and Justinian I (who quote especially compromising passages to prove Origen a heretic). The polemical anti-Origenists, however, need to be read with care since they were not above misquoting Origen and ascribing to him the words of later Origenists. Origen’s great vindication of Christianity against pagan attack, Contra Celsum, written (probably in 248) at Ambrose’s request, survives in its entirety in one Vatican manuscript, with fragments in the Philocalia and on papyruses. Paragraph by paragraph it answers the Alēthēs logos (“The True Doctrine” or “Discourse”) of the 2nd-century anti-Christian philosopher Celsus and is therefore a principal source for the pagan intelligentsia’s view of 2nd-century Christianity as well as a classic formulation of early Christian reply. Both protagonists agree in their basic Platonic presuppositions, but beside this agreement, serious differences are argued. Celsus’ brusque dismissal of Christianity as a crude and bucolic onslaught on the religious traditions and intellectual values of classical culture provoked Origen to a sustained rejoinder in which he claimed that a philosophic mind has a right to think within a Christian framework and that the Christian faith is neither a prejudice of the unreasoning masses nor a crutch for social outcasts or nonconformists. The tract On Prayer, preserved in one manuscript at Cambridge, was written in about 233; it expounds the Lord’s Prayer and discusses some of the philosophical problems of petition, arguing that petition can only be excluded by a determinism false to the experience of personality, while the highest prayer is an elevation of the soul beyond material things to a passive inward union with Christ, mediator between men and the Father.Restaurante Origen Oaxaca: Make a reservation directly through OpenTable.\n\n \n\n You can contact us by phone too\n\n +52 (951) 501 1764\n\n \n\n reservaciones@origenoaxaca.com\n\n \n\n Hours of operation\n\n Monday to Saturday 13:00 a 23:00hrs\n\n Sunday 13:30 a 22:00hrsNOM | Mexican Table & Tequila Bar: In the tequila world a NOM number is representative of a distillery or family, and their commitment to respecting the blue agave plant.

Con este nombre también era conocido el rublo en ucraniano.\n\nLa etimología del vocablo karbóvanets ha sido debatida. Algunos piensan que el nombre proviene del verbo \"cabar\" (karbuvaty), ya que en tiempos primitivos se marcaban muescas de los números a calcular en piedras o trozos metálicos.[cita requerida]\n\nEl nominativo plural de la palabra karbóvanets es карбованці (karbovantsi). Este se usa junto a números que acaben en 2, 3 o 4 (por ejemplo, два карбованцi, «dos karbóvanets»), mientras que para los números acabados en 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 y 0 se utiliza el genitivo plural, карбованців (karbovantsiv). Para los números acabados en 1 se utiliza el nominativo singular.\n\nEn marzo de 1917 varios partidos políticos reunidos en Kiev establecieron la Rada Central Ucraniana, la cual proclamó el 20 de noviembre de 1917 la República Popular de Ucrania.\n\nEl 19 de diciembre del mismo año se promulgó una ley para la emisión de billetes en la RPU. De acuerdo con esta ley, los billetes debían estar denominados en karbóvanets, y cada unidad contendría 17.424 partes de oro puro y se dividiría en 2 grivnias o 200 shahs (en ucraniano: Шаг)\n\nEl 5 de enero de 1918 se emitió el primer billete de 100 karbovánets. El tridente utilizado en este billete fue tomado como emblema nacional de la RPU solo 54 días después de la aparición en el billete, el 1 de marzo de 1918. Solamente se imprimió una serie de billetes, la \"AД\", y nada más que un número de serie, el 185. Debido a que el papel utilizado para imprimir los billetes era normal (sin medidas de seguridad ni marcas de agua), pronto apareció un gran número de billetes falsos.\n\nEl 20 de septiembre de 1918, la Rada Central aprobó la emisión de billetes a cargo del Tesoro Nacional en denominaciones de 5, 10, 25 y 50 karbovánets, que serían válidos hasta el 1 de marzo de 1924. El 6 de abril la población de Kiev vio por primera vez los billetes de 25 karbovánets, y más tarde los de 50 karbovánets; sin embargo, las denominaciones de 5 y 10 karbovánets no llegaron a emitirse. Los primeros billetes no tenían designación ni número de serie. En las impresiones posteriores se añadió el lugar de impresión: AK (Kiev) y AO (Odesa).\n\nTras la ocupación de Odesa por el Ejército de Voluntarios en la primavera de 1919, la imprenta establecida en Odesa continuó produciendo billetes de 50 karbovánets. Esto instó al gobierno ucraniano a declarar ilegal el dinero emitido por el Ejército de Voluntarios, por lo que los billetes con la designación de serie AO y el número 210 en adelante quedaron invalidados.\n\nEn 1920 el gobierno soviético de Ucrania imprimió millones de billetes de 50 karbóvanets para que el Comité Revolucionario (Glavrevkom ) los utilizase de forma temporal en la parte occidental de Ucrania. Estas series tenían la designación AO 210 en adelante.\n\nEl siguiente cambio que propugnó la Rada Central fue el 19 de abril de 1918, en la que se incluyeron denominaciones de 10, 20, 30, 50 y 50 shahs. La Rada Central utilizó el término \"shah\" de las antiguas monedas de cambio que circularon durante el siglo XVI. Estos billetes se imprimieron en Kiev en paquetes de 100, perforándolos para facilitar la tarea de separar los billetes. Los shahs estuvieron en circulación desde marzo de 1919 hasta que fueron abolidos por los soviéticos.\n\nEl 29 de abril de 1918, con el apoyo de las tropas austrogermanas, se eligió al general zarista P.P. Skoropadsky como Hetman de Ucrania. Posteriormente disolvió la Rada Central y estableció el Estado Ucraniano. Durante el mandato de Skoropadsky se introdujeron billetes denominados en grivnias, impresos en Alemania.\n\nEl 5 de agosto de 1918 aparecieron los primeros bonos respaldados por el Estado con el nombre de \"Billete del Tesoro del Estado\". Estos bonos se imprimieron en ocho cupones, cuatro a cada lado. Al principio se emitieron para las transacciones menores de carácter interno, pero la carencia de billetes en circulación hizo al gobierno permitir la utilización de estos cupones como papel-moneda.\n\nEl 17 de octubre de 1918, el Hetman recibió de Alemania otra remesa de billetes en denominaciones de 2, 10 y 100 grivnias. Más tarde se recibieron billetes de 1.000 y 2.000 grivnias, debido a la inflación que sufría Ucrania. Estos billetes incorporaban las siglas del Estado Ucraniano: УД (Українська Держава). Estas grivnias se emitieron el 17 de octubre de 1918, 59 días antes del derrocamiento del Hetman.\n\nLa derrota de las tropas alemanas y austrohúngaras en la I Guerra Mundial terminó con la ocupación de Ucrania y el régimen del Hetman Skoropadsky. En la noche de 14 de noviembre de 1918 en la ciudad de Bila Tserkva V.K. Vynnychenko y S.V. Petlyura formaron el Directorado de Ucrania. En menos de un mes las fuerzas militares del Directorado ocuparon Kiev. El 16 de enero de 1919 el gobierno declaró la guerra a Rusia, lo que provocó la necesidad de producir grandes cantidades de dinero. En Kiev el Directorado utilizó reservas de los billetes emitidos previamente por los gobiernos de la Rada Central.\n\nLa campaña militar del Directorado se torció, y la ofensiva del Ejército Rojo obligó al Directorado abandonar Kiev y establecerse durante algún tiempo en Vínnitsa. Bajo la presión de las fuerzas soviéticas el Directorado se retiró a Ternopil y después a Ivano-Frankivsk a finales de febrero. En marzo de 1919 se emitió una serie de billetes de 5 grivnias en papel gris y con errores ortográficos. El siguiente bastión del Directorado se trasladó a Kamanets-Podilsk, donde permaneció casi un año y emitió más billetes.\n\nEn agosto de 1919 se imprimieron billetes de 100, 250 y 1.000 karbóvanets. Uno de los mejores billetes impresos fue el de 1.000 karbóvanets, emitido el Kiev y puesto en circulación el 13 de noviembre de 1918. La impresión de este billete fue continuada por el Directorado en octubre de 1919 en Kamyanets-Podilsk, y en 1920 en Varsovia.\n\nMás tarde se añadieron denominaciones de 10 y 25 karbóvanets. Los últimos billetes del Directorado se imprimieron en Austria. Estas series se componían de billetes de 50 y 1.000 grivnias, sin embargo nunca llegaron a circular. El 20 de noviembre de 1920 el Directorado de Ucrania fue derrocado por el edicto de S.V. Petlyura.\n\nA comienzos de 1919 en Járkov se proclamó la nueva RSS de Ucrania. Bajo el mandato de Lenin, Rusia financió al gobierno soviético de Ucrania. Sin embargo, un periodo de inflación provocó una guerra civil a la que siguió un pronunciado déficit de dinero en circulación.\n\nEl Comisario de Economía de la URSS, con el consentimiento mutuo de la RSS de Rusia decidió utilizar los billetes de 10 karbóvanets emitidos por el Directorado de Ucrania. Estos billetes fueron requisados por el Ejército Rojo el 5 de febrero de 1919 tras la liberación de Kiev de las tropas petlyurianas. Los billetes soviéticos eran distintos de los del Directorado en cuanto a calidad del papel, tintas, marcas de agua, y la disposición de los números de serie.\n\nSe imprimió un billete de 50 karbovánets con símbolos soviéticos. El 1 de junio de 1919, la Ucrania soviética junto a los gobiernos soviéticos de Rusia, Lituania, Letonia y Bielorrusia en un frente común adoptaron el rublo soviético como moneda de curso legal.\n\nDurante la ocupación de Ucrania por la Alemania Nazi en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el Comisariado de Ucrania (Reichskommissariat Ukraine) emitió billetes denominados en karbóvanets (en alemán: karbowanez). Estos billetes sustituyeron al rublo soviético a la par y estuvo en circulación entre 1942 y 1945. El karbóvanets fijó su paridad al reichsmark con una tasa de cambio de 10 UAK = 1 RM.\n\nEn noviembre de 1990, el colapso del modelo soviético de gobierno y el fin de éste condujeron a la desaparición del esquema de una economía centralizada. La nueva RSS de Ucrania emitió cupones temporales que se distribuyeron entre la población. Estos cupones circulaban junto al rublo soviético y servían para comprar verduras y otros bienes básicos. El 10 de enero de 1992, el karbóvanets sustituyó al rublo soviético a la par.\n\nEn 1996 el karbóvanets, que se había devaluado varias veces, se sustituyó por la grivna con una tasa de cambio de 100.000 UAK = UAH. Hubo un periodo de adaptación de quince días, entre el 2 y el 16 de septiembre. Tras esta fecha el karbóvanets dejó de ser moneda de curso legal para cualquier tipo de pago en Ucrania.\n• None Esta obra contiene una traducción derivada de « Ukrainian karbovanets » de Wikipedia en inglés, publicada por sus editores bajo la Licencia de documentación libre de GNU y la Licencia Creative Commons Atribución-CompartirIgual 4.0 InternacionalMoneda 200000 Karbóvanets Ucrania 1995 Aniv.

You’d think you’d know there was more to the story.\n\n\n\nYou’d think.\n\n\n\nBut nope.\n\n\n\nI still remember my reaction when I first heard what happened to Thabo. It was 2015, late in the season. Thabo and I were teammates on the Hawks, and we’d flown into New York late after a game in Atlanta. When I woke up the next morning, our team group text was going nuts. Details were still hazy, but guys were saying, Thabo hurt his leg? During an arrest ? — he spent the night in jail ?! Everyone was pretty upset and confused.\n\n\n\nWell, almost everyone. My response was….. different. I’m embarrassed to admit it.\n\n\n\nWhich is why I want to share it today.\n\n\n\nBefore I tell the rest of this story, let me just say real quick — Thabo wasn’t some random teammate of mine, or some guy in the league who I knew a little bit. We’d become legitimate friends that year in our downtime. He was my go-to teammate to talk with about stuff beyond the basketball world. Politics, religion, culture, you name it — Thabo brought a perspective that wasn’t typical of an NBA player. And it’s easy to see why: Before we were teammates in Atlanta, the guy had played professional ball in France, Turkey and Italy. He spoke three languages! Thabo’s mother was from Switzerland, and his father was from South Africa. They lived together in South Africa before Thabo was born, then left because of apartheid.\n\n\n\nIt didn’t take long for me to figure out that Thabo was one of the most interesting people I’d ever been around. We respected each other. We were cool, you know? We had each other’s backs.\n\n\n\nAnyway — on the morning I found out that Thabo had been arrested, want to know what my first thought was? About my friend and teammate? My first thought was: What was Thabo doing out at a club on a back-to-back ??\n\n\n\nYeah. Not, ? Not, What happened during the arrest ?? Not, Something seems off with this story . Nothing like that. Before I knew the full story, and before I’d even had the chance to talk to Thabo….. I sort of Thabo.\n\n\n\nI thought, , if I’d been in Thabo’s shoes, out at a club late at night, the police wouldn’t have arrested me. Not unless I was doing something wrong .\n\n\n\nCringe.\n\n\n\nIt’s not like it was a conscious thought. It was pure reflex — the first thing to pop into my head.\n\n\n\nAnd I was worried about him, .\n\n\n\nBut still. Cringe.\n\n\n\nA few months later, a jury found Thabo not guilty on all charges. He settled with the city over the NYPD’s use of force against him. And then the story just sort of….. disappeared. It fell away from the news. Thabo had surgery and went through rehab. Pretty soon, another NBA season began — and we were back on the court again.\n\n\n\nLife went on.\n\n\n\nBut I still couldn’t shake my discomfort.\n\n\n\nI mean, I hadn’t been involved in the incident. I hadn’t even . So why did I feel like I’d let my friend down?\n\n\n\nWhy did I feel like I’d let myself down?\n\nA few weeks ago, something happened at a Jazz home game that brought back many of those old questions.\n\n\n\nMaybe you saw it: We were playing against the Thunder, and Russell Westbrook and a fan in the crowd exchanged words during the game. I didn’t actually see or hear what happened, and if you were following on TV or on Twitter, maybe you had a similar initial viewing of it. Then, after the game, one of our reporters asked me for my response to what had gone down between Russ and the fan. I told him I hadn’t seen it — and added something like, But you know Russ. He gets into it with the crowd a lot .\n\n\n\nOf course, the full story came out later that night. What actually happened was that a fan had said some really ugly things at close range to Russ. Russ had then responded. After the game, he’d said he felt the comments were racially charged.\n\n\n\nThe incident struck a nerve with our team.\n\n\n\nIn a closed-door meeting with the president of the Jazz the next day, my teammates shared stories of similar experiences they’d had — of feeling degraded in ways that went beyond acceptable heckling. One teammate talked about how his mom had called him right after the game, concerned for his safety in SLC. One teammate said the night felt like being “in a zoo.” One of the guys in the meeting was Thabo — he’s my teammate in Utah now. I looked over at him, and remembered his night in NYC.\n\n\n\nEveryone was upset. I was upset — and embarrassed, too. But there was another emotion in the room that day, one that was harder to put a finger on. It was almost like….. disappointment, mixed with exhaustion. Guys were just of it all.\n\n\n\nThis wasn’t the first time they’d taken part in conversations about race in their NBA careers, and it wasn’t the first time they’d had to address the hateful actions of others. And one big thing that got brought up a lot in the meeting was how incidents like this — they weren’t only about the people directly involved. This wasn’t only about Russ and some heckler. It was about more than that.\n\n\n\nIt was about what it means just to right now — as a person of color in a mostly white space.\n\n\n\nIt was about racism in America.\n\n\n\nBefore the meeting ended, I joined the team’s demand for a swift response and a promise from the Jazz organization that it would address the concerns we had. I think my teammates and I all felt it was a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nBut I don’t think anyone felt satisfied.\n\nThere’s an elephant in the room that I’ve been thinking about a lot over these last few weeks. It’s the fact that, demographically, if we’re being honest: I have more in common with the fans in the crowd at your average NBA game than I have with the players on the court.\n\n\n\nAnd after the events in Salt Lake City last month, and as we’ve been discussing them since, I’ve really started to recognize the role those demographics play in my privilege. It’s like — I may be Thabo’s friend, or Ekpe’s teammate, or Russ’s colleague; I may those guys. And I absolutely 100% stand with them.\n\n\n\nBut I the other guy.\n\n\n\nAnd whether I like it or not? I’m beginning to understand how that means something.\n\n\n\nWhat I’m realizing is, no matter how passionately I commit to being an ally, and no matter how unwavering my support is for NBA and WNBA players of color….. I’m still in this conversation from the privileged perspective of to it. Which of course means that on the flip side, I could just as easily of it. Every day, I’m given that choice — I’m granted that privilege — based on the color of my skin.\n\n\n\nIn other words, I can say every right thing in the world: I can voice my solidarity with Russ after what happened in Utah. I can evolve my position on what happened to Thabo in New York. I can be that weird dude in bragging about how he’d have voted for Obama a third term. I can condemn every racist heckler I’ve ever known.\n\n\n\nBut I can also fade into the crowd, and my face can blend in with the faces of those hecklers, any time I want.\n\n\n\nI realize that now. And maybe in years past, just realizing something would’ve felt like progress. But it’s NOT years past — it’s today. And I know I have to do better. So I’m trying to push myself further.\n\n\n\nI’m trying to ask myself what I should actually do.\n\n\n\nHow can I — as a white man, part of this systemic problem — become part of the when it comes to racism in my workplace? In my community? In this country?\n\n\n\nThese are the questions that I’ve been asking myself lately.\n\n\n\nAnd I don’t think I have all the answers yet — but here are the ones that are starting to ring the most true:\n\n\n\nI have to continue to educate myself on the history of racism in America.\n\n\n\nI have to listen. I’ll say it again, because it’s that important. .\n\n\n\nI have to support leaders who see racial justice as fundamental — as something that’s at the heart of nearly every major issue in our country today. And I have to support policies that do the same.\n\n\n\nI have to do my best to recognize when to get out of the way — in order to amplify the voices of marginalized groups that so often get lost.\n\n\n\nBut maybe more than anything?\n\n\n\nI know that, as a white man, I have to hold my fellow white men accountable.\n\n\n\nWe all have to hold each other accountable.\n\n\n\nAnd we all have to accountable — period. Not just for our own actions, but also for the ways that our inaction can create a “safe” space for toxic behavior.\n\n\n\nAnd I think the standard that we have to hold ourselves to, in this crucial moment….. it’s higher than it’s ever been. We have to be active. We have to be supporting the causes of those who’ve been marginalized — precisely because they’ve been marginalized.\n\nTwo concepts that I’ve been thinking about a lot lately are and .\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to racism in America, I think that guilt and responsibility tend to be seen as more or less the same thing. But I’m beginning to understand how there’s a real difference.\n\n\n\nAs white people, are we of the sins of our forefathers? No, I don’t think so.\n\n\n\nBut are we for them? Yes, I believe we are.\n\n\n\nAnd I guess I’ve come to realize that when we talk about solutions to systemic racism — police reform, workplace diversity, affirmative action, better access to healthcare, even reparations? It’s not about guilt. It’s not about pointing fingers, or passing blame.\n\n\n\nIt’s about responsibility. It’s about understanding that when we’ve said the word “equality,” for generations, what we’ve really meant is equality for a certain group of people . It’s about understanding that when we’ve said the word “inequality,” for generations, what we’ve really meant is , and its aftermath — which is still being felt to this day. It’s about understanding on a fundamental level that black people and white people, they still have it different in America. And that those differences come from an ugly history….. not some random divide.\n\n\n\nAnd it’s about understanding that Black Lives Matter, and movements like it, matter, because — well, let’s face it: I probably would’ve been safe on the street that one night in New York. And Thabo wasn’t. And I safe on the court that one night in Utah. And Russell wasn’t.\n\nBut as disgraceful as it is that we have to deal with in NBA arenas in 2019? The truth is, you could argue that that kind of racism is “easier” to deal with.\n\n\n\nBecause at least in those cases, the racism is loud and clear. There’s no ambiguity — not in the act itself, and thankfully not in the response: we throw the guy out of the building, and then we ban him for life.\n\n\n\nBut in many ways the more dangerous form of racism isn’t that loud and stupid kind. It isn’t the kind that announces itself when it walks into the arena. It’s the quiet and subtle kind. The kind that almost hides itself in plain view. It’s the person who does and says all the “right” things in public: They’re perfectly friendly when they meet a person of color. They’re very polite. But in private? Well….. they sort of wish that everyone would stop making everything “about race” all the time.\n\n\n\nIt’s the kind of racism that can seem almost invisible — which is one of the main reasons why it’s allowed to persist.\n\n\n\nAnd so, again, banning a guy like Russ’s heckler? To me, that’s the “easy” part. But if we’re really going to make a difference as a league, as a community, and as a country on this issue….. it’s like I said — I just think we need to push ourselves another step further.\n\n\n\nFirst, by identifying that less visible, less obvious behavior as what it is: .\n\n\n\nAnd then second, by that racism — actively, and at every level.\n\n\n\nThat’s the bare minimum of where we have to get to, I think, if we’re going to consider the NBA — or any workplace — as anything close to part of the solution in 2019.\n\nI’ll wrap this up in a minute — but first I have one last thought.\n\n\n\nThe NBA is over 75% players of color.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPeople of color, they built this league. They’ve grown this league. People of color have made this league into what it is today. And I guess I just wanted to say that if you can’t find it in your heart to support them — ? And I mean actively support them?\n\n\n\nIf the best that you can do for their cause is to passively “tolerate” it? If that’s the standard we’re going to hold ourselves to — to blend in, and opt out?\n\n\n\nWell, that’s not good enough. It’s not even close.\n\n\n\nI know I’m in a strange position, as one of the more recognized white players in the NBA. It’s a position that comes with a lot of….. interesting undertones. And it’s a position that makes me a symbol for a lot of things, for a lot of people — often people who don’t know anything about me. Usually, I just ignore them. But this doesn’t feel like a “usually” moment.\n\n\n\nThis feels like a moment to draw a line in the sand.\n\n\n\nI believe that what’s happening to people of color in this country — right now, in 2019 — is wrong.\n\n\n\nThe fact that black Americans are more than five times as likely to be incarcerated as white Americans is . The fact that black Americans are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white Americans is . The fact that black unemployment rates nationally are double that of overall unemployment rates is . The fact that black imprisonment rates for drug charges are almost six times higher nationally than white imprisonment rates for drug charges is . The fact that black Americans own approximately one-tenth of the wealth that white Americans own is .\n\n\n\nThe fact that inequality is built so deeply into so many of our most trusted institutions is .\n\n\n\nAnd I believe it’s the responsibility of anyone on the privileged end of those inequalities to help make things right.\n\n\n\nSo if you don’t want to know anything about me, outside of basketball, then listen — I get it. But if you do want to know something? Know .\n\n\n\nKnow that about me.\n\n\n\nIf you’re wearing my jersey at a game? Know that about me. If you’re planning to buy my jersey for someone else…… know that about me. If you’re following me on social media….. know that about me. If you’re coming to Jazz games and rooting for me….. know that about me.\n\n\n\nAnd if you’re claiming my name, or likeness, for your own cause, in any way….. know that about me. Know that I believe this matters.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\n\nTime for me to shut up and listen.Kyle Korver - Milwaukee Bucks Guard: 'The real answers are in the mud': How Julius Randle became a Thibs GuyEsports - Wikipedia: Esports ( ), short for electronic sports, is a form of competition using video games.[3] Esports often takes the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players, played individually or as teams.[4]\n\nMultiplayer competitions were long a part of video game culture, but were largely between amateurs until the late 2000s, when the advent of online streaming media platforms, particularly YouTube and Twitch, enabled a surge in participation by professional gamers and spectators.[5][6] By the 2010s, esports was a major part of the video game industry, with many game developers designing for and funding for tournaments and other events.\n\nEsports first became popular in East Asia, particularly in China and South Korea (which first licensed professional players in 2000) but less so in Japan, whose broad anti-gambling laws prohibit professional gaming tournaments.[7][8] Esports are also popular in Europe and the Americas, which host regional and international events.\n\nThe most common video game genres associated with esports are multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), first-person shooter (FPS), fighting games, card, battle royales, and real-time strategy (RTS) games. Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft. Among the most popular tournaments are the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia. The International Olympic Committee has discussed their inclusion in future Olympic events.\n\nIn the early 2010s, viewership was about 85% male and 15% female, with most viewers between the ages of 18 and 34.[9][10][11] By the late 2010s, it was estimated that by 2020, the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than US$1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of the global esports revenue.[12][13]\n\nThe earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the game Spacewar. Stanford students were invited to an \"Intergalactic spacewar olympics\" whose grand prize was a year's subscription for Rolling Stone, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament, and Slim Tovar and Robert E. Maas winning the team competition.[14]\n\nContemporary esports has roots in competitive face-to-face arcade video game competitions. A forerunner of esports was held by Sega in 1974, the All Japan TV Game Championships, a nationwide arcade video game tournament in Japan.[15][16][17] The tournament was intended by Sega to promote the play and sales of video games in the country. There were local tournaments held in 300 locations across Japan, and then sixteen finalists from across the country competed in the final elimination rounds at Tokyo's Hotel Pacific. Prizes awarded included television sets (color and black-and-white), cassette tape recorders and transistor radios. According to Sega, the tournament \"proved to be the biggest event ever\" in the arcade game industry, and was attended by members from leading Japanese newspapers and leisure industry companies.[15] Sega stressed \"the importance of such tournaments to foster better business relationships between the maker-location-customer and create an atmosphere of competition on TV amusement games\".[16][15] In 1977, Gremlin Industries (a year before being acquired by Sega) held a marketing stunt to promote their early arcade snake game Hustle in the United States, involving the \"Gremlin Girls\" who were a duo of professional female arcade players called Sabrina Osment and Lynn Reid.[18][19] The pair travelled across 19 American cities, where players could challenge them in best-of-three matches for a chance to win money. The duo were challenged by a total of 1,300 players, only about seven of whom managed to beat them.[19]\n\nThe golden age of arcade video games was heralded by Taito's Space Invaders in 1978, which popularized the use of a persistent high score for all players. Several video games in the next several years followed suit, adding other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players' initials in games like Asteroids in 1979. High score-chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition.[20] The Space Invaders Championship held by Atari in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition, attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream hobby.[21] It was won by Rebecca Heineman.[22] Walter Day, owner of an arcade in Iowa, had taken it upon himself to travel across the United States to record the high scores on various games in 1980, and on his return, founded Twin Galaxies, a high score record-keeping organization.[23] The organization went on to help promote video games and publicize its records through publications such as the Guinness Book of World Records, and in 1983 it created the U.S. National Video Game Team. The team was involved in competitions, such as running the Video Game Masters Tournament for Guinness World Records[24][25] and sponsoring the North American Video Game Challenge tournament.[26] A multicity tour in 1983, the \"Electronic Circus\", was used to feature these players in live challenges before audiences, and draw more people to video games.[20] These video game players and tournaments were featured in well-circulated newspapers and popular magazines including Life and Time and became minor celebrities at the time, such as Billy Mitchell.[27][28] Besides establishing the competitive nature of games, these types of promotional events all formed the nature of the marketing and promotion that formed the basis of modern esports.[20]\n\nIn 1984, Konami and Centuri jointly held an international Track & Field arcade game competition that drew more than a million players from across Japan and North America. Play Meter in 1984 called it \"the coin-op event of the year\" and an \"event on a scale never before achieved in the industry\".[29] As of 2016 , it holds the record for the largest organized video game competition of all time, according to Guinness World Records.[30]\n\nTelevised esports events aired during this period included the American show Starcade which ran from 1982 to 1984 airing a total of 133 episodes, on which contestants would attempt to beat each other's high scores on an arcade game.[31] A video game tournament was included as part of TV show That's Incredible!,[32] and tournaments were also featured as part of the plot of various films, including 1982's Tron.[33] In the UK, the BBC game show First Class included competitive video game rounds featuring the contemporary arcade games, such as Hyper Sports, 720° and Paperboy.[34][35] In the United States, the Amusement Players Association held its first U.S. National Video Game Team competition in January 1987, where Vs. Super Mario Bros. was popular among competitive arcade players.[36]\n\nThe 1988 game Netrek was an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in cross-platform open-source software. Netrek was the third Internet game, the first Internet game to use metaservers to locate open game servers, and the first to have persistent user information. In 1993 it was credited by Wired Magazine as \"the first online sports game\".[37]\n\nThe fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players.[38] Previously, video games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player, but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would instead challenge each other directly, \"face-to-face\", to determine the best player,[38] paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games.[39] The popularity of fighting games such as Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom in the 1990s led to the foundation of the international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports tournament in 1996.\n\nLarge esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which toured across the United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California. Nintendo held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Nintendo PowerFest '94. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in San Diego, California. Mike Iarossi took home 1st prize. Blockbuster Video also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s, co-hosted by GamePro magazine. Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Chile were eligible to compete. Games from the 1994 championships included NBA Jam and Virtua Racing.[40]\n\nTelevision shows featuring esports during this period include the British shows GamesMaster and Bad Influence!; the Australian game show A*mazing, where in the final round contestants competed in a video game face-off; and the Canadian game show Video & Arcade Top 10.\n\nIn the 1990s, many games benefited from increasing internet connectivity, especially PC games. Inspired by the fighting games Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting, id Software's John Romero established competitive multiplayer in online games with Doom's deathmatch mode in 1993.[41] Tournaments established in the late 1990s include the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), QuakeCon, and the Professional Gamers League. PC games played at the CPL included the Counter-Strike series, Quake series, StarCraft, and Warcraft.\n\nThe growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass building of broadband Internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[42] It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things to do while out of work.[43] Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country.[44] Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Park Jie-won coined the term \"Esports\" at the founding ceremony of the 21st Century Professional Game Association (currently Korean e-Sports Association) in 2000.[45]\n\n\"Evo Moment 37\", also known as the \"Daigo Parry\", refers to a portion of a Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike semi-final match held at Evolution Championship Series 2004 (Evo 2004) between Daigo Umehara (playing Ken Masters) and Justin Wong (playing Chun-Li). During this match, Umehara made an unexpected comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's \"Super Art\" move while having only one pixel of vitality. Umehara subsequently won the match. \"Evo Moment #37\" is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming. Being at one point the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time, it has been compared to sports moments such as Babe Ruth's called shot and the Miracle on Ice.[46]\n\nIn April 2006, the G7 teams federation were formed by seven prominent Counter-Strike teams. The goal of the organization was to increase stability in the esports world, particularly in standardizing player transfers and working with leagues and organizations. The founding members were 4Kings, Fnatic, Made in Brazil, Mousesports, NiP, SK-Gaming, and Team 3D.[47] The organization only lasted until 2009 before dissolving.[48]\n\nThe 2000s was a popular time for televised esports. Television coverage was best established in South Korea, with StarCraft and Warcraft III competitions regularly televised by dedicated 24-hour cable TV game channels Ongamenet and MBCGame.[49] Elsewhere, esports television coverage was sporadic. The German GIGA Television covered esports until its shutdown in 2009. The United Kingdom satellite television channel XLEAGUE.TV broadcast esports competitions from 2007 to 2009. The online esports only channel ESL TV[50] briefly attempted a paid television model renamed GIGA II from June 2006 to autumn 2007. The French channel Game One broadcast esports matches in a show called Arena Online for the Xfire Trophy.[51] The United States channel ESPN2 hosted Madden NFL competitions in a show called Madden Nation from 2005 to 2008.[52] DirecTV broadcast the Championship Gaming Series tournament for two seasons in 2007 and 2008.[49] CBS aired prerecorded footage of the 2007 World Series of Video Games tournament that was held in Louisville, Kentucky.[53] The G4 television channel originally covered video games exclusively, but broadened its scope to cover technology and men's lifestyle, though has now shutdown.[49]\n\nDuring the 2010s, esports grew tremendously, incurring a large increase in both viewership and prize money.[54][55] Although large tournaments were founded before the 21st century, the number and scope of tournaments has increased significantly, going from about 10 tournaments in 2000 to about 260 in 2010.[6] Many successful tournaments were founded during this period, including the World Cyber Games, the Intel Extreme Masters, and Major League Gaming. The proliferation of tournaments included experimentation with competitions outside traditional esports genres. For example, the September 2006 FUN Technologies Worldwide Webgames Championship featured 71 contestants competing in casual games for a $1 million grand prize.[56]\n\nThe popularity and emergence of online streaming services have helped the growth of esports in this period, and are the most common method of watching tournaments. Twitch, an online streaming platform launched in 2011, routinely streams popular esports competitions. In 2013, viewers of the platform watched 12 billion minutes of video on the service, with the two most popular Twitch broadcasters being League of Legends and Dota 2.[57] During one day of The International, Twitch recorded 4.5 million unique views, with each viewer watching for an average of two hours.[6]\n\nThe modern esports boom has also seen a rise in video games companies embracing the esports potential of their products. After many years of ignoring and at times suppressing the esports scene, Nintendo hosted Wii Games Summer 2010. Spanning over a month, the tournament had over 400,000 participants, making it the largest and most expansive tournament in the company's history. In 2014 Nintendo hosted an invitational Super Smash Bros. for Wii U competitive tournament at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference that was streamed online on Twitch.[58] Halo developers 343 Industries announced in 2014 plans to revive Halo as an esport with the creation of the Halo Championship Series and a prize pool of US$50,000.[59] Both Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have their own collegiate outreach programs with their North American Collegiate Championship.[60][61] Since 2013 universities and colleges in the United States such as Robert Morris University Illinois and the University of Pikeville have recognized esports players as varsity level athletes and offer athletic scholarships.[62] In 2017, Tespa, Blizzard Entertainment's collegiate esports division, unveiled its new initiative to provide scholarships and prizes for collegiate esports clubs competing in its tournaments worth US$1 million.[63] Colleges have begun granting scholarships to students who qualify to play esports professionally for the school. Colleges such as Columbia College, Robert Morris University, and Indiana Institute of Technology have taken part in this.[64] In 2018, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology began a tuition scholarship program for esports players.[65]\n\nIn 2014, the largest independent esports league, Electronic Sports League, partnered with the local brand Japan Competitive Gaming to try and grow esports in the country.[66]\n\nPhysical viewership of esports competitions and the scope of events have increased in tandem with the growth of online viewership.[67] In 2013, the Season 3 League of Legends World Championship was held in a sold-out Staples Center.[68] The 2014 League of Legends World Championship in Seoul, South Korea, had over 40,000 fans in attendance and featured the band Imagine Dragons, and opening and closing ceremonies in addition to the competition.[69]\n\nIn 2015, the first Esports Arena was launched in Santa Ana, California, as the United States' first dedicated esports facility.[70]\n\nThe global esports audience reached 662.6 million in 2020, and 921 million in 2022.[71]\n\nIn 2021, China announced a law which forbade minors from playing video games, which they described as \"spiritual opium\", for more than three hours a week.[72] With China being a large market, the law raised concerns about the future of esports within the country.[73][74][75]\n\nLabeling competitive video games as a sport is a controversial topic.[76][77][78] Proponents[79] argue that esports are a fast-growing \"non-traditional sport\" which requires \"careful planning, precise timing, and skillful execution\".[80] Others claim that sports involve physical fitness and physical training, and prefer to classify esports as a mind sport.[81]\n\nFormer ESPN president John Skipper described esports in 2014 as a competition and \"not a sport\".[82][83][84][85][86][87] In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic.[88] In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected esports competitions of other genres.[89] In the 2015 World Championship hosted by the International Esports Federation, an esports panel of guests from international sports society discussed the future recognition of esports as a legitimate sport.[90]\n\nRussia was the first country that classified \"cybersport\" as an official sport discipline[91] on 25 July 2001.[92] After a series of reforms in Russian sports, it was classified as a sport again on 12 March 2004.[92][93][94][95] In July 2006, it was removed from a list of sport disciplines because it did not fit the new sport standards.[96][97] On 7 July 2016, The Ministry of Sport decided to add cybersport into the sport registry[98] and on 13 April 2017, esports become an official sport discipline once again.[citation needed]\n\nChina was another one of the first countries to recognize esports as a real sport in 2003,[99] despite concerns at the time that video games were addictive. Through this, the government encouraged esports, stating that by participating in esports, players were also \"training the body for China\".[100] Furthermore, by early 2019, China recognized esports players as an official profession within the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security's Occupation Skill Testing Authority recommendations, as well as professional gaming operators, those that distribute and manage esports games.[101] By July 2019, more than 100,000 people had registered themselves as professional gamers under this, with the Ministry stating that they anticipate over 2 million such people in this profession in five years.[102]\n\nIn 2013, Canadian League of Legends player Danny \"Shiphtur\" Le became the first pro gamer to receive an American P-1A visa, a category designated for \"Internationally Recognized Athletes\".[103][104] In 2014, Turkey's Ministry of Youth and Sports started issuing esports licenses to players certified as professionals.[105][106] In 2016, the French government started working on a project to regulate and recognize esports.[107] The Games and Amusements Board of the Philippines started issuing athletic licenses to Filipino esports players who are vouched for by a professional esports team in July 2017.[108][109]\n\nTo help promote esports as a legitimate sport, several esports events have been run alongside more traditional international sports competitions. The 2007 Asian Indoor Games was the first notable multi-sport competition including esports as an official medal-winning event, alongside other traditional sports, and the later editions of the Asian Indoor Games, as well as its successor the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, have always included esports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now. Moreover, the Asian Games, which is the Asian top-level multi-sport competition, also included esports as a medal event at the 2022 edition; esports around games such as Hearthstone, Starcraft II, and League of Legends were presented as an exhibition event at the 2018 Asian Games as a lead-in to the 2022 games.[110][111] The 2019 Southeast Asian Games included six medal events for esports.[112] Since 2018, World Sailing has held an eSailing World Championship that showed a main sports federation embracing esports.[113] The Virtual Regatta race shadowing the 2020-2021 Vendee Globe was the first online game believe to have in excess of 1,000,000 unique users[114]\n\nAhead of The International 2021, which was originally set to take place in Stockholm in 2020, the Swedish Sports Confederation voted in June 2021 to deny recognition of esports as a sporting event, which jeopardized plans for how Valve had arranged the event in regards to travel visas for international players. Valve had tried to work with Sweden to accommodate players, but eventually rescheduled the event to Romania instead.[115][116]\n\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games featured esports competitions as a pilot ahead of being a potential full medal event for 2026.[117]\n\nIn Greece, in March 2022 a law entered into force recognising and regulating esports[118] and in June 2023, the relevant federation for esports has been officially given recognition[119] and included in the list of sports federations.[120]\n\nThe Olympic Games are also seen as a potential method to legitimize esports. A summit held by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2017 acknowledged the growing popularity of esports, concluding that \"Competitive 'esports' could be considered as a sporting activity, and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports\" but would require any games used for the Olympics fitting \"with the rules and regulations of the Olympic movement\".[121] Another article by Andy Stout suggests that 106 million people viewed the 2017 Worlds Esports competition.[122] International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has noted that the IOC is troubled by violent games and the lack of a global sanctioning body for esports.[123][111] Bach acknowledged that many Olympic sports originated from violent combat, but stated that \"sport is the civilized expression about this. If you have egames where it's about killing somebody, this cannot be brought into line with our Olympic values.\"[111] Due to that, the IOC suggested that they would approve more esports centered around games that simulate real sports, such as the NBA 2K or FIFA series.[124]\n\nThe issues around esports have not prevented the IOC from exploring what possibilities there are for incorporation into future Olympics. In July 2018, the IOC and the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) held a symposium and invited major figures in esports, including Epic Games' Mark Rein, Blizzard Entertainment's Mike Morhaime, and esports players Dario \"TLO\" Wünsch, Jacob \"Jake\" Lyon, and Se-yeon \"Geguri\" Kim, for these organizations \"to gain a deeper understanding of esports, their impact and likely future development, so that [they] can jointly consider the ways in which [they] may collaborate to the mutual benefit of all of sport in the years ahead\".[125][126] The IOC has tested the potential for esports through exhibition games. With support from the IOC, Intel sponsored exhibition esports events for StarCraft II and Steep prior to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, and five South Korean esports players were part of the Olympic Torch relay.[127][128] A similar exhibition showcase, the eGames, was held alongside the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, though this was not supported by the IOC.\n\nDuring the Eighth Olympic Summit in December 2019, the IOC reiterated that it would only consider sports-simulating games for any official Olympic event, but it would look at two paths for such games in the future: those that promoted good physical and mental health lifestyles, and virtual reality and augmented reality games that included physical activity.[129]\n\nIn the late 2010s, leaders in Japan became involved in helping bring esports to the 2020 Summer Olympics and beyond, given the country's reputation as a major video game industry centre. Esports in Japan had not flourished due to the country's anti-gambling laws that also prevent paid professional gaming tournaments, but there were efforts starting in late 2017 to eliminate this issue.[8] At the suggestion of the Tokyo Olympic Games Committee for the 2020 Summer Olympics, four esports organizations have worked with Japan's leading consumer organization to exempt esports tournaments from gambling law restrictions. Takeo Kawamura, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, led a coalition of ruling and opposing politicians to support esports, called the Japan esports Union, or JeSU.[130] Kawamura said that they would be willing to pass laws to further exempt esports as needed so that esports athletes can make a living playing these sports. So far, this has resulted in the ability of esports players to obtain exemption licenses to allow them to play, a similar mechanism needed for professional athletes in other sports in Japan to play professionally.[8] The first such licenses were given out in mid-July 2018, via a tournament held by several video game publishers to award prizes to many players but with JeSU offering these exemption licenses to the top dozen or so players that emerge, allowing them to compete in further esports events.[130] The Tokyo Olympic Committee has also planned to arrange a number of esports events leading up to the 2020 games.[8] With the IOC, five esports events were set as part of an Olympic Virtual Series from 13 May to 23 June 2021, ahead of the games. Each event in auto racing, baseball, cycling, rowing and sailing will be managed by an IOC-recognized governing body for the sport along with a video game publisher of a game for that sport. For example, the auto racing event will be based on the Gran Turismo series and overseen by the International Automobile Federation along with Polyphony Digital. The baseball, cycling, and esailing events will be based on eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball 2020, Zwift, and Virtual Regatta, respectively.[131]\n\nThe organization committee for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris were in discussions with the IOC and the various professional esports organizations to consider esports for the event, citing the need to include these elements to keep the Olympics relevant to younger generations.[132] Ultimately, the organization committee determined esports were premature to bring to the 2024 Games as medal events, but have not ruled out other activities related to esports during the Games.[133]\n\nIn September 2021, the Olympic Council of Asia announced eight esports games will officially debut as medal sports for the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.[134]\n\nIn December 2021, the IOC confirmed its Olympic Virtual Series (OVS) will return in 2022. The first edition of the OVS which ran from 13 May to 23 June, featured nearly 250,000 participants and had more than two million entries.[135]\n\nIn January 2022, the IOC announced the appointment of the organization's first ever head of virtual sport, tasked with the development of virtual sport for the global Olympic body, increasing the organization's engagement with gaming communities, and overseeing the Olympic Virtual Series, IOC's first licensed non-physical sports event. The inaugural series included virtual baseball, cycling, rowing, esailing and motorsports events.[136]\n\nIn February 2022, the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that esports would be included in the 2022 Commonwealth Games as a pilot event, with the possibility of it being a medal event in the 2026 Games.[137] The inaugural Commonwealth Esports Championship had separate branding, medals, and organization and included both men and women's Dota 2, eFootball, and Rocket League events.[138]\n\nAs a follow-up to 2021's Olympic Virtual Series, the IOC and the Singapore National Olympic Council held the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in Singapore in June 2023.[139] Games featured at the event included:[140][141][142]\n\nIn June 2024, the IOC Executive Board announced the proposal to establish the Olympic Esports Games during the 142nd IOC Session held prior to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, with the inaugural event to take place in 2025 at Saudi Arabia following a new partnership with their National Olympic Committee.[143][144] The proposal was ultimately approved by a unanimous vote on 23 July 2024.[145]\n\nA number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafés, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games[citation needed] as of the early 2020s are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Fortnite, Rocket League, Valorant, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch.[146] Hearthstone has also popularized the digital collectible card game (DCCG) genre since its release in 2014.[147]\n\nWhile it is common for video games to be designed with the experience of the player in game being the only priority, many successful esports games have been designed to be played professionally from the beginning. Developers may decide to add dedicated esports features, or even make design compromises to support high level competition. Games such as StarCraft II,[148] League of Legends,[149] and Dota 2[150] have all been designed, at least in part, to support professional competition.\n\nIn addition to allowing players to participate in a given game, many game developers have added dedicated observing features for the benefit of spectators. This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player's point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have. The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage. Games with these features include Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty,[151] StarCraft II,[152][153] Dota 2,[154] and Counter-Strike.[155] League of Legends includes spectator features, which are restricted to custom game modes.[156][157]\n\nIn response to the release of virtual reality headsets in 2016, some games, such as Dota 2, were updated to include virtual reality spectating support.[158]\n\nA very common method for connection is the Internet. Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting cheating compared to physical events, and greater network latency, which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and exhibition games.\n\nSince the 1990s, professional teams or organized clans have set up matches via Internet Relay Chat networks such as QuakeNet. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of Blizzard's Battle.net, which has been integrated into both the Warcraft and StarCraft series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a game server, either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines.\n\nAdditionally, competitions are also often conducted over a local area network or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little lag and higher quality. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software modding. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize LAN parties or visit Internet cafés, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs.\n\nIndividual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original StarCraft, StarCraft II was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players.[159] League of Legends was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments.[160] In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to Dota 2 in a patch for the game.[161]\n\nProfessional gamers are often associated with esports teams or broader gaming and entertainment organizations. Teams such as FaZe Clan, Cloud9, Fnatic, T1, G2 Esports, and Natus Vincere have become successful within esports and now sponsor esports players around the world.[162][163] These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within Evolution Championship Series, or Hearthstone tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as Logitech and Razer.[164] Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million.[165] Associations include the Korean e-Sports Association (KeSPA), the International e-Sports Federation (IeSF), the British esports Association, and the World esports Association (WESA).\n\nSome traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, such as Rick Fox's ownership of Echo Fox,[166] Jeremy Lin's ownership of Team VGJ,[167] and Shaquille O'Neal's investment in NRG Esports.[168] Some association football teams, such as FC Schalke 04 in Germany,[169] Paris Saint-Germain esports in France;[170] Besiktas JK, Fenerbahce S.K., and Galatasaray in Turkey; Panathinaikos F.C. in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams.[171]\n\nCompetitive Esports tournaments in the most popular games pay hundreds to thousands of dollars to players for winning tournaments.[172] Dota 2's 2021 tournament The International had a prize pool over $40 million, the largest in esports history, thanks to its Compendium battle pass contributing a portion of its sales to it. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive had a total 2021 prize pool, across all tournaments, of around $22 million.[173] The current biggest esports tournament by prize pool, the King Pro League Grand Finals for Honor of Kings, provides just under US$10 million for the twelve teams that take part.[174] However, financial security in the industry is largely limited to players in top performing teams. One study found that only 1 in 5 professional gamers have careers that last longer than two years.[175] Team rosters are extremely volatile, sometimes changing players or rosters within a season.[176]\n\nWhile different from the regimens of traditional sports, esports athletes still have extensive training routines. Team Liquid's professional League of Legends team practices for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more.[177] In April 2020, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esports players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes.[178][179] This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age. Players are generally in competition by their mid- to late-teens, with most retiring by their late-20s.[180]\n\nThere is a long history of different esports teams or certain players in leagues that aren't exactly the same as most players. For example, there are many esports organizations or teams that are entirely made up of players that have physical disabilities. Permastunned and ParaEsports are great examples of this where ParaEsports is completely composed of professional CSGO players that have cerebral palsy. Whilst these teams aren't in many cases very successful in the major leagues of their respective esports, there are certain leagues or tournaments that are restricted to only have teams or players like these be able to compete. Although these teams or tournaments don't get nearly as much attention, budget, or prize pool as the main leagues of popular esports, it is still important to recognize these amazing players that have overcome their unfortunate positions and strive to succeed.\n\nIn most team-based esports, organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition's organization based on how the team fared in matches; this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher-level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games ran several League of Legends series, with the League of Legends Championship Series being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the League of Legends Challenger Series, replaced by the better performing teams from that series. This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid-2018, but the promotion and relegation format still exists within Southeast Asia's Pacific Championship Series and in North America's new tier 2 league, the North American Challengers Series, as of 2024.\n\nWith rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in North American professional sports, in which all teams, backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise, participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport's premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing.[181] Though the details vary from league to league, these leagues generally require all signed player to have a minimum salary with appropriate benefits, and may share in the team's winnings. While there is no team promotion or relegation, players can be signed onto contracts, traded among teams, or let go as free agents, and new players may be pulled from the esports' equivalent minor league.\n\nThe first such league to be formed was the Overwatch League, established by Blizzard Entertainment in 2016 based on its Overwatch game.[182] Initially launched in 2018 with 12 teams, the league expanded to twenty teams in 2019. Though the first two seasons were played at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, the Overwatch League's third season in 2020 will implement the typical home/away game format at esports arenas in the teams' various home cities or regions.[183] The OWL would fold in 2023 and would be replaced by a more open esports structure for Overwatch known as the Overwatch Champions Series.[184][185]\n\nTake-Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to create the NBA 2K League, using the NBA 2K game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30 professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season started in May 2018 with 17 teams and the league has since expanded to 25 teams, including teams owned by Gen.G and Australia's National Basketball League.[186][187]\n\nSimilar to the NBA 2K League, EA Sports and Major League Soccer (MLS) established the eMLS in 2018, a league using EA's FIFA (Now known as EA Sports FC) series.[188] EA would later establish esports leagues with other professional football leagues, ranging from the English Premier League to the Saudi Pro League, which would feed into qualification for the FIFAe World Cup and later the EA Sports FC Pro World Championship.\n\nActivision launched its 12-team Call of Duty League in January 2020, following the format of the Overwatch League but based on the Call of Duty series.[183]\n\nCloud9 and Dignitas, among others, developed a franchise-based Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league, Flashpoint, in February 2020. This was the first such esports league to be owned by the teams rather than any single organization.[189] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications, Flashpoint would be discontinued by 2022.[190]\n\nEsports are also frequently played in tournaments, where potential players and teams vie to be placed through qualification matches before entering the tournament. From there, the tournament formats can vary from single or double elimination, sometimes hybridized with group stage.[191] Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience, with referees or officials to monitor for cheating. The tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as Dreamhack, or the competition may be the entirety of the event, like the World Cyber Games or the Fortnite World Cup. Esports competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi-genre conventions.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in 1997, tournaments became much larger, and corporate sponsorship became more common. Increasing viewership both in person and online brought esports to a wider audience.[5][192] Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games, the North American Major League Gaming league, the France-based Electronic Sports World Cup, and the World e-Sports Games held in Hangzhou, China.\n\nThe average compensation for professional esports players does not compare to those of the top classical sports organizations in the world. According to Julian Krinsky Camps & Programs website, the top Esports player in the world earned around $2.5 million in 2017.[193][better source needed] The highest overall salary by any esports professional at the time was around $3.6 million. While prizes for esports competitions can be very large, the limited number of competitions and large number of competitors ultimately lowers the amount of money one can make in the industry. In the United States, Esports competitions have prizes that can reach $200,000 for a single victory. Dota 2 International hosted a competition where the grand-prize winning team walked home with almost $10.9 million.[193]\n\nFor well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year.[194][195] As of 10 September 2016, Dota 2 has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million. League of Legends awarded approximately $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, but in addition to the prize money, Riot Games provides salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series.[196] Nonetheless, there has been criticism to how these salaries are distributed, since most players earn a fairly low wage but a few top players have a significantly higher salary, skewing the average earning per player.[197] In August 2018, The International 2018, Valve's annual premier Dota 2 tournament, was held and broke the record for holding the largest prize pool to date for any esports tournament, amounting to over US$25 million.[198]\n\nOften, game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly,[194] but sponsorship may also come from third parties, typically companies selling computer hardware, energy drinks, or computer software. Generally, hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand-alone venture.[199] For example, Riot has stated that their headline League of Legends Championship Series is \"a significant investment that we're not making money from\".[200]\n\nThere is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and tournament organizers and broadcasters. While the original StarCraft events emerged in South Korea largely independently of Blizzard, the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to authorize events featuring the sequel StarCraft II.[201] In the short term, this led to a deadlock with the Korean e-Sports Association.[202] An agreement was reached in 2012.[203] Blizzard requires authorization for tournaments with more than US$10,000 in prizes.[204] Riot Games offers in-game rewards to authorized tournaments.[205]\n\nThe increasing popularity of esports brought with it a demand for extended opportunities for esports athletes. Esports clubs grew in popularity at American universities in the late 2000s and early 2010s, with StarCraft clubs competing by 2009.[206][207] Universities, particularly in China and America, then began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming students to join collegiate esports teams. The first officially recognized varsity esports program was created at Robert Morris University in 2014.[208][209][210] As of 2019, around 125 US colleges had esports-based varsity programs. Most of these are members of the National Association of Collegiate Esports.[211]\n\nThe UK's National University Esports League (NUEL) started in 2010. In 2023, it was taken over by Spanish Esports company GGTech Entertainment.[212][213] As of 2024, it had been rebranded as University Esports UK & Ireland and had over 110 participating universities.[214] Another university competition in the UK is the British Universities Esports Championship, run by National Student Esports (NSE), which also had over 110 participating universities and colleges as of 2024 . The University of Warwick won its sixth consecutive NES Esports University of the Year title in 2024.[215] The two organisations are not exclusive, with universities able to field teams in both NUEL and NSE competitions.[216] For younger students, the British Esports Student Champs had over 1,250 teams from over 200 schools and colleges as of 2024 .[217] Collegiate universities such as Durham and multi-campus universities such as Staffordshire also hold inter-collegiate or inter-campus tournaments.[218][219]\n\nAccording to Schaeperkoetter and collaborators in 2017, the potential impact of esports programs on universities, coupled with the growing interest that universities were showing in such programs, combined to make esports a relevant line of research in sport literature.[220]\n\nWhile game publishers or esports broadcasters typically act in oversight roles for specific esports, a number of esports governing bodies have been established to collectively represent esports on a national, regional or global basis. These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport, from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a trade group and public face for esports.\n\nThe International Esports Federation (IESF) was one of the first such bodies. Originally formed in 2008 to help promote esports in the Southeast Asian region, it has grown to include over 140 member countries from across the globe. The IESF has managed annual World Esports Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games.[221]\n\nThe European Esports Federation was formed in April 2019 and includes UK, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine. This body was designed more to be a managing partner for other esports, working to coordinate event structures and regulations across multiple esports.[222]\n\nAdditionally, trade groups representing video games have also generally acted as governing bodies for esports. Notably, in November 2019, five major national trade organizations – the Entertainment Software Association in the United States, the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment, Interactive Software Federation of Europe, and the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association of Australian and New Zealand – issued a joined statement for supporting the promotion and participation of esports to respect player safety and integrity, respect and diversity among players, and enriching game play.[223]\n\nMost esports generally require participants to sit and/or move little while playing, which raises concerns about a sedentary lifestyle by players. A research led by Ingo Froböse, a professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, for over eight years found professional and also amateur esports gamers play on average 24–25 hours per week and even physical activities after hours of playing are not able to compensate the damage of oversitting. Players in China may train for almost 14 hours a day. A study conducted in 2022 of CS:GO players found that total hours played were about 31.2 hours each week.[224] Sitting for long periods at a computer could lead to eye fatigue and lower back pain from poor posture. Gamers with poor posture sit in forward head posture which can cause symptoms such as decreased arm or shoulder mobility and tension headaches.[225] These sedentary behaviors of sitting for too long concerns public health researchers because spending more than 6–8 hours per day has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.[226] As a result, teams like T1 have partnered with Nike to encourage exercise and provide training that helps improve gaming skills.[227] Recent research has also shown that structured esports activities can foster teamwork, problem-solving skills, and promote digital literacy among participants, though concerns about sedentary behavior and mental health risks persist.[228]\n\nIn addition to sedentary behaviors, players' mental health is a concern for scientists. One study found that competitors in esports are often under psychological and physical stress, and the amateur ones are the most affected, since they frequently aim at greater wins without enough preparation, though no clear training guidelines are set to become professional players.[229][230] Researchers have found that high levels of stress lead to mental illness and poor decision making.[231] The Esports sector has a high rate of burnout due to mental health and stress. A study found a correlation between depression and training time leading to sleep disturbances.[232] Teams are starting to incorporate mental health support for players. Misfits has hired a psychologist to ensure players are equipped with methods to deal with stress and anxiety.[233]\n\nEsports athletes are usually obligated to behave ethically, abiding by both the explicit rules set out by tournaments, associations, and teams, as well as following general expectations of good sportsmanship. For example, it is common practice and considered good etiquette to send a \"gg\" (good game) message to opponents when defeated.[234] Many games rely on competitors having limited information about the game state. In a prominent example of good conduct, during a 2012 IEM StarCraft II game, players Feast and DeMusliM voluntarily offered information about their strategies to negate the influence of outside information inadvertently leaked to Feast during the game.[235] Players in some leagues have been reprimanded for failing to meet expectations of good behavior. In 2012, professional League of Legends player Christian \"IWillDominate\" Riviera was banned from competing for one year following a history of verbal abuse.[236] In 2013, StarCraft II progamer Greg \"Idra\" Fields was fired from Evil Geniuses for insulting his fans on the Team Liquid internet forums.[237] League of Legends players Mithy and Nukeduck received similar penalties in 2014 after behaving in a \"toxic\" manner during matches.[238]\n\nThe formation of Team Siren, an all-female League of Legends team, in June 2013 was met with controversy and dismissed as a \"gimmick\" to attract men's attention.[239][240] The team disbanded within a month due to negative publicity from their promotional video and the team captain's poor attitude towards her teammates.[241][242] In 2018, Team Vaevictis attempted to field an all-female roster in the LCL, the top esports league in Russia,[243] but faced similar criticism.[244] Vaevictis went 0–14 in both splits, and in February 2020, the LCL announced their disbandment due to a failure to field a competitive roster.[245][246][247] The LCL stated, \"The results of the 2019 season showed a huge difference in Vaevictis Esports' results compared to other LCL teams, which is an unacceptable level of competitiveness in a franchised league.\"\n\nThere have been serious rule violations in certain esports. In 2010, eleven StarCraft: Brood War players were found guilty of fixing matches for profit and were fined and banned from future competition. Team Curse and Team Dignitas were denied prize money for collusion during the 2012 MLG Summer Championship.[248] In 2012, League of Legends team Azubu Frost was fined US$30,000 for cheating during a semifinal match of the world playoffs.[249] Dota 2 player Aleksey \"Solo\" Berezin was suspended from several tournaments for intentionally throwing a game to collect $322 from online gambling.[250] In 2014, four high-profile North American Counter-Strike players from iBuyPower were suspended from official tournaments after being found guilty of match-fixing, allegedly profiting over US$10,000 through betting on their fixed matches.[251] Gambling on esports using Counter-Strike: Global Offense \"skins\", worth an estimated US$2.3 billion in 2015, came under criticism in June and July 2016 after several questionable legal and ethical aspects were discovered.[252]\n\nReports of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in esports are not uncommon, with players discussing their own, their teammates' and their competitors' use as well as officials acknowledging the prevalence of the issue.[253][254][255] Players often turn to stimulants such as Ritalin, Adderall and Vyvanse, drugs which can significantly boost concentration, improve reaction time, and prevent fatigue.[253] Selegiline, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, is reportedly popular, because like stimulants, it enhances mood and motivation. Conversely, drugs with calming effects are also sought after. Some players take propranolol, which blocks the effects of adrenaline, or Valium, which is prescribed to treat anxiety disorder, in order to remain calm under pressure.[254] According to Bjoern Franzen, a former SK Gaming executive, it is second nature for some League of Legends players to take as many as three different drugs before competition.[256] In July 2015 Kory \"Semphis\" Friesen, an ex-Cloud9 player, admitted that he and his teammates were all using Adderall during a match against Virtus.pro in the ESL One Katowice 2015 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament, and went on to claim that \"everyone\" at ESEA League tournaments uses Adderall.[255] In 2020, former Call of Duty champion Adam \"KiLLa\" Sloss told The Washington Post that one of the major reasons he stopped competing in esports was the \"rampant\" use of Adderall in the competitive scene.[257]\n\nThe unregulated use of such drugs poses severe risks to competitors' health, including addiction, overdose, serotonin syndrome and, in the case of stimulants, weight loss.[253][254] Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Although International e-Sports Federation (IeSF) is a signatory of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the governing body has not outlawed any PEDs in its sanctioned competitions.[253] Action has been taken on the individual league level, however, as at least one major league, the Electronic Sports League, has made use of any drugs during matches punishable by expulsion from competition.[258] Although not all players use drugs, the use of over-the-counter energy drinks is common. These energy drinks are often marketed specifically toward gamers, and have also faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to their health risks.[259]\n\nThere has been some concern over the quality of life and potential mistreatment of players by organizations, especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive salaries, leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, League of Legends player Bae \"Dade\" Eo-jin said that \"Korean players wake up at 1 pm and play until 5 am\", and suggested that the 16-hour play schedule was a significant factor in causing burnout.[260] Concerns over the mental health of players intensified in 2014 when League of Legends player Cheon \"Promise\" Min-Ki attempted suicide a week after admitting to match fixing.[261]\n\nTo combat the negative environment, Korean League of Legends teams were given new rules for the upcoming 2015 season by Riot Games, including the adoption of minimum salaries for professional players, requiring contracts and allowing players to stream individually for additional player revenue.[262]\n\nSince esports games often requires many actions per minute, some players may get repetitive strain injuries, causing hand or wrist pain.[263] During the early development of the esports industry, sports medicine and gaming-related injuries were ignored by players and organizations, leading to some early player retirements.[264]\n\nThe League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea offer guaranteed salaries for players.[265] Despite this, online streaming is preferred by some players, as in some cases, streaming can be more profitable than competing with a team, and streamers have the ability to determine their own schedule. The International tournament awards US$10 million to the winners, however teams that do not have the same amount of success often do not have financial stability and frequently break up after failing to win.[266]\n\nIn 2015 it was estimated by SuperData Research, that the global esports industry generated revenue of around US$748.8 million that year. Asia is the leading esports market with over $321 million in revenue, with North America at around $224 million, and Europe at $172 million. For comparison, the rest of the world combines for approximately $29 million.[267] Global esports revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the video gaming industry bypassed many economic sectors by providing a means of compensating for the physical isolation imposed by the lockdown, transforming it into an increasingly important economic sector within the global economy.[268]\n\nThe number of female viewers has been growing in esports, with an estimated 30% of esports viewers being female in 2013, a significant increase from 15% the previous year.[citation needed] However, despite the increase in female viewers, there is not a growth of female players in high level competitive esports.[citation needed] The top female players that are involved in esports mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, most notably Counter-Strike, Dead or Alive 4, and StarCraft II. Current all-female esports teams include Frag Dolls and PMS Clan.[citation needed]\n\nGambling on esports matches have historically been illegal or unregulated by major markets. This created a black market via virtual currency. In places where esports gambling is not officially recognized, the lack of regulation has resulted in match-fixing by players or third parties, and created issues with underage gambling due to the draw of video games. Some games allow bets in their in-game currency,[269] while third-party gambling platforms will often take bets placed using virtual items earned in games.[270] In esports gambling, most bets and odds are structured in the same way as traditional sports. Most gambling sites offering the booker service allow users to bet based on the outcome of tournaments, matches or special esports titles. On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are numerous innovative ways to make bets, which are based on in-game milestones.[271] For example, League of Legend bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the \"First Blood\".[272]\n\nEsports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA). The Act prevented all but five states from allowing gambling on sporting events.[270] However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some betting houses in Nevada, where sports betting has been already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as non-competitive \"other events\" similar to the selection of the Heisman Trophy winner or NFL Draft which are considered as legal.[270] Other companies established in the United States allow betting on esports to international users but are restricted to Americans. Nevada legalized esports gambling in June 2017, classifying esports along with competitive sports and dog racing.[273] With the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in May 2018, PASPA was recognized as unconstitutional, as the Court claimed that the federal government cannot limit states from regulating sports betting. This created the potential for legalized esports-based betting in the United States.[274] However, New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, passed its bill to legalize sports gambling but restricted gambling on esports to only international competitions where most players are over 18 years of age.[275] Without PASPA, interstate gambling on esports would be still be limited by the Federal Wire Act, preventing users from betting on national esports events outside of the state.[270]\n\nIn 2019, the countries where esports gambling is legal include the UK, New Zealand, Australia, China, Spain, Canada, South Korea, and Japan, and many of them are the international hosts for gaming tournaments.[276] By the end of 2019, the state of New Jersey approved esports betting, just in time for the finals of the LoL Worlds Cup 2019 final match, which had over 4.000.000 spectators.[277]\n\nThe esports gambling industry has attracted criticism because of its target audience. As a large part of the esports audience is underage, governments and regulators have expressed skepticism regarding the market and the possibility of underage gambling. Additionally, gambling platforms have received criticism for their integration with the larger esports industry.[278] Esports platforms regularly sponsor professional esports teams, as happened with the contract between Betway and PSG.LGD team (Dota 2) in August 2019.[279]\n\nWith the growing popularity of machine learning in data analytics,[citation needed] esports has been the focus of several software programs that analyze the plethora of game data available. Based on the huge number of matches played on a daily basis globally (League of Legends alone had a reported 100 million active monthly players worldwide in 2016[280] and an average of 27 million League of Legends games played per day reported in 2014[281]), these games can be used for applying big-data machine learning platforms. Several games make their data publicly available, so websites aggregate the data into easy-to-visualize graphs and statistics. In addition, several programs use machine learning tools to predict the win probability of a match based on various factors, such as team composition.[282] In 2018, the DotA team Team Liquid partnered with a software company to allow players and coaches to predict the team's success rate in each match and provide advice on what needs to be changed to improve performance.[283]\n\nAs more esports competitions and leagues are run entirely or in portion by the video game publisher or developer for the game, the ongoing viability of that game's esports activities is tied to that company. In December 2018, Blizzard announced that it was reducing resources spent on the development of Heroes of the Storm and canceling its plans for tournaments in 2019. This caused several professional Heroes players and coaches to recognize that their career was no longer viable, and expressed outrage and disappointment at Blizzard's decision.[284][285]\n\nThe main medium for esports coverage is the Internet. In the mid-2010s, mainstream sports and news reporting websites, such as ESPN, Yahoo!, Sport1, Kicker, and Aftonbladet started dedicated esports coverage.[286][287] esports tournaments commonly use commentators or casters to provide live commentary of games in progress, similar to a traditional sports commentator. For popular casters, providing commentary for esports can be a full-time position by itself.[288] Prominent casters for StarCraft II include Dan \"Artosis\" Stemkoski and Nick \"Tasteless\" Plott. However, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic affected how esports were covered in addition to the sports themselves. Notably, ESPN's dedicated esports coverage was shuttered in November 2020 as the network refocus on more traditional sports, though said they would still have some coverage of esports events.[289]\n\nIn 2018, the Associated Press' AP Stylebook officially began spelling the word as \"esports\", dropping support for both the capital \"S\" and the dash between \"e\" and \"sports\" styles, similar to how \"e-mail\" transformed with common usage to \"email\".[290][291] Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as \"Ninja\", became the first professional gamer to appear in a cover story for a major sports magazine when he appeared in the September 2018 issue of ESPN The Magazine.[292]\n\nMany esports events are streamed online to viewers over the internet. With the shutdown of the Own3d streaming service in 2013, Twitch is by far the most popular streaming service for esports, competing against other providers such as Hitbox.tv, Azubu, and YouTube Gaming.[293][294] Dreamhack Winter 2011 reached 1.7 million unique viewers on Twitch.[295] While coverage of live events usually brings in the largest viewership counts, the recent popularization of streaming services has allowed individuals to broadcast their own gameplay independent of such events as well. Individual broadcasters can enter an agreement with Twitch or Hitbox in which they receive a portion of the advertisement revenue from commercials which run on the stream they create.[296]\n\nAnother major streaming platform was Major League Gaming's MLG.tv.[297] The network, which specializes in Call of Duty content but hosts a range of gaming titles, has seen increasing popularity, with 1376% growth in MLG.tv viewership in Q1 of 2014.[298] The 2014 Call of Duty: Ghosts broadcast at MLG's X Games event drew over 160,000 unique viewers.[299] The network, like Twitch, allows users to broadcast themselves playing games, though only select individuals can use the service. For several years, MLG.tv was the primary streaming platform for the Call of Duty professional scene; famous players such as NaDeSHoT and Scump have signed contracts with the company to use its streaming service exclusively.[300] In January 2016, MLG was acquired by Activision Blizzard.[301]\n\nYouTube also relaunched its livestreaming platform with a renewed focus on live gaming and esports specifically.[302] For The International 2014, coverage was also simulcast on ESPN's streaming service ESPN3.[303] In December 2016, Riot Games announced a deal with MLB Advanced Media's technology division BAM Tech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of League of Legends events through 2023. BAM Tech will pay Riot at least $300 million per-year, and split advertising revenue.[304][305]\n\nEspecially since the popularization of streaming in esports, organizations no longer prioritize television coverage, preferring online streaming websites such as Twitch. Ongamenet continues to broadcast as an esports channel in South Korea, but MBCGame was taken off the air in 2012. Riot Games' Dustin Beck stated that \"TV's not a priority or a goal\",[306] and DreamHack's Tomas Hermansson said \"esports have [been proven] to be successful on internet streaming [services].\"[307]\n\nOn the night before the finals of The International 2014 in August, ESPN3 broadcast a half-hour special profiling the tournament.[303] In 2015, ESPN2 broadcast Heroes of the Dorm, the grand finals of the Heroes of the Storm collegiate tournament. The first-place team from the University of California, Berkeley received tuition for each of the team's players, paid for by Blizzard and Tespa.[308] The top four teams won gaming equipment and new computers. This was the first time an esport had ever been broadcast on a major American television network. The broadcast was an attempt to broaden the appeal of esports by reaching viewers who would not normally come across it. However, the broadcast was met with a few complaints. Those living outside of the United States were unable to view the tournament. Additionally, the tournament could not be viewed online via streams, cutting off a large portion of viewers from the main demographic in the process.[309]\n\nIn September 2015, Turner Broadcasting partnered with WME/IMG. In December 2015, the partnered companies announced two seasons of the ELeague, a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league based in North America including 15 teams from across the world competing for a $1,200,000 prize pool each 10-week season. The tournament, filmed at Turner's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, was simultaneously streamed on online streaming websites and TBS on Friday nights.[310]\n\nIn January 2016, Activision Blizzard, publishers of the Call of Duty and StarCraft series, acquired Major League Gaming. In an interview with The New York Times about the purchase, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick explained that the company was aspiring to create a U.S. cable network devoted to esports, which he described as \"the ESPN of video games\". He felt that higher quality productions, more in line with those of traditional sports telecasts, could help to broaden the appeal of esports to advertisers. Activision Blizzard had hired former ESPN and NFL Network executive Steve Bornstein to be CEO of the company's esports division.[301]\n\nTV 2, the largest private television broadcaster in Norway, broadcasts esports across the country. TV 2 partnered with local Norwegian organization House of Nerds to bring a full season of esports competition with an initial lineup of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, League of Legends, and StarCraft II.[311][312]\n\nIn April 2016, Big Ten Network announced a collaboration with Riot to hold an invitational League of Legends competition between two universities from the collegiate Big Ten Conference, as part of Riot's collegiate championships at PAX East.[313] On 17 January 2017, Big Ten Network and Riot announced that it would hold a larger season of conference competition involving 10 Big Ten schools.[314]\n\nNielsen Holdings, a global information company known for tracking viewership for television and other media, announced in August 2017 that it would launch Nielsen esports, a division devoted to providing similar viewership and other consumer research data around esports, forming an advisory board with members from ESL, Activision Blizzard, Twitch, YouTube, ESPN, and FIFA to help determine how to track and monitor audience sizes for esports events.[315]\n\nIn July 2018, on the first day of the inaugural 2018 Overwatch League season playoffs, Blizzard and Disney announced a multi-year deal that gave Disney and its networks ESPN and ABC broadcast rights to the Overwatch League and Overwatch World Cup, starting with the playoffs and continuing with future events.[316]\n• Doris Self (recognised in 2007 by the Guinness World Records as the oldest video game competitor)\n• Official website of the International Esports Federation (IESF)\n• Official website of the European Esports Federation (EEF)\n• The Rise of Competitive Gaming & E-Sports Video produced by Off BookNRG Esports: This item is a recurring or deferred purchase.

Popular esports franchises include League of Legends, Dota, Counter-Strike, Valorant, Overwatch, Street Fighter, Super Smash Bros. and StarCraft. Among the most popular tournaments are the League of Legends World Championship, Dota 2's International, the fighting game-specific Evolution Championship Series (EVO) and Intel Extreme Masters. Many other competitions use a series of league play with sponsored teams, such as the Overwatch League. Although the legitimacy of esports as a true sporting competition remains in question, they have been featured alongside traditional sports in some multinational events in Asia. The International Olympic Committee has discussed their inclusion in future Olympic events.\n\nIn the early 2010s, viewership was about 85% male and 15% female, with most viewers between the ages of 18 and 34.[9][10][11] By the late 2010s, it was estimated that by 2020, the total audience of esports would grow to 454 million viewers, with revenue increasing to more than US$1 billion, with China accounting for 35% of the global esports revenue.[12][13]\n\nThe earliest known video game competition took place on 19 October 1972 at Stanford University for the game Spacewar. Stanford students were invited to an \"Intergalactic spacewar olympics\" whose grand prize was a year's subscription for Rolling Stone, with Bruce Baumgart winning the five-man-free-for-all tournament, and Slim Tovar and Robert E. Maas winning the team competition.[14]\n\nContemporary esports has roots in competitive face-to-face arcade video game competitions. A forerunner of esports was held by Sega in 1974, the All Japan TV Game Championships, a nationwide arcade video game tournament in Japan.[15][16][17] The tournament was intended by Sega to promote the play and sales of video games in the country. There were local tournaments held in 300 locations across Japan, and then sixteen finalists from across the country competed in the final elimination rounds at Tokyo's Hotel Pacific. Prizes awarded included television sets (color and black-and-white), cassette tape recorders and transistor radios. According to Sega, the tournament \"proved to be the biggest event ever\" in the arcade game industry, and was attended by members from leading Japanese newspapers and leisure industry companies.[15] Sega stressed \"the importance of such tournaments to foster better business relationships between the maker-location-customer and create an atmosphere of competition on TV amusement games\".[16][15] In 1977, Gremlin Industries (a year before being acquired by Sega) held a marketing stunt to promote their early arcade snake game Hustle in the United States, involving the \"Gremlin Girls\" who were a duo of professional female arcade players called Sabrina Osment and Lynn Reid.[18][19] The pair travelled across 19 American cities, where players could challenge them in best-of-three matches for a chance to win money. The duo were challenged by a total of 1,300 players, only about seven of whom managed to beat them.[19]\n\nThe golden age of arcade video games was heralded by Taito's Space Invaders in 1978, which popularized the use of a persistent high score for all players. Several video games in the next several years followed suit, adding other means of tracking high scores such with high score tables that included the players' initials in games like Asteroids in 1979. High score-chasing became a popular activity and a means of competition.[20] The Space Invaders Championship held by Atari in 1980 was the earliest large scale video game competition, attracting more than 10,000 participants across the United States, establishing competitive gaming as a mainstream hobby.[21] It was won by Rebecca Heineman.[22] Walter Day, owner of an arcade in Iowa, had taken it upon himself to travel across the United States to record the high scores on various games in 1980, and on his return, founded Twin Galaxies, a high score record-keeping organization.[23] The organization went on to help promote video games and publicize its records through publications such as the Guinness Book of World Records, and in 1983 it created the U.S. National Video Game Team. The team was involved in competitions, such as running the Video Game Masters Tournament for Guinness World Records[24][25] and sponsoring the North American Video Game Challenge tournament.[26] A multicity tour in 1983, the \"Electronic Circus\", was used to feature these players in live challenges before audiences, and draw more people to video games.[20] These video game players and tournaments were featured in well-circulated newspapers and popular magazines including Life and Time and became minor celebrities at the time, such as Billy Mitchell.[27][28] Besides establishing the competitive nature of games, these types of promotional events all formed the nature of the marketing and promotion that formed the basis of modern esports.[20]\n\nIn 1984, Konami and Centuri jointly held an international Track & Field arcade game competition that drew more than a million players from across Japan and North America. Play Meter in 1984 called it \"the coin-op event of the year\" and an \"event on a scale never before achieved in the industry\".[29] As of 2016 , it holds the record for the largest organized video game competition of all time, according to Guinness World Records.[30]\n\nTelevised esports events aired during this period included the American show Starcade which ran from 1982 to 1984 airing a total of 133 episodes, on which contestants would attempt to beat each other's high scores on an arcade game.[31] A video game tournament was included as part of TV show That's Incredible!,[32] and tournaments were also featured as part of the plot of various films, including 1982's Tron.[33] In the UK, the BBC game show First Class included competitive video game rounds featuring the contemporary arcade games, such as Hyper Sports, 720° and Paperboy.[34][35] In the United States, the Amusement Players Association held its first U.S. National Video Game Team competition in January 1987, where Vs. Super Mario Bros. was popular among competitive arcade players.[36]\n\nThe 1988 game Netrek was an Internet game for up to 16 players, written almost entirely in cross-platform open-source software. Netrek was the third Internet game, the first Internet game to use metaservers to locate open game servers, and the first to have persistent user information. In 1993 it was credited by Wired Magazine as \"the first online sports game\".[37]\n\nThe fighting game Street Fighter II (1991) popularized the concept of direct, tournament-level competition between two players.[38] Previously, video games most often relied on high scores to determine the best player, but this changed with Street Fighter II, where players would instead challenge each other directly, \"face-to-face\", to determine the best player,[38] paving the way for the competitive multiplayer and deathmatch modes found in modern action games.[39] The popularity of fighting games such as Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom in the 1990s led to the foundation of the international Evolution Championship Series (EVO) esports tournament in 1996.\n\nLarge esports tournaments in the 1990s include the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, which toured across the United States, and held its finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in California. Nintendo held a 2nd World Championships in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System called the Nintendo PowerFest '94. There were 132 finalists that played in the finals in San Diego, California. Mike Iarossi took home 1st prize. Blockbuster Video also ran their own World Game Championships in the early 1990s, co-hosted by GamePro magazine. Citizens from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Chile were eligible to compete. Games from the 1994 championships included NBA Jam and Virtua Racing.[40]\n\nTelevision shows featuring esports during this period include the British shows GamesMaster and Bad Influence!; the Australian game show A*mazing, where in the final round contestants competed in a video game face-off; and the Canadian game show Video & Arcade Top 10.\n\nIn the 1990s, many games benefited from increasing internet connectivity, especially PC games. Inspired by the fighting games Street Fighter II, Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting, id Software's John Romero established competitive multiplayer in online games with Doom's deathmatch mode in 1993.[41] Tournaments established in the late 1990s include the Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL), QuakeCon, and the Professional Gamers League. PC games played at the CPL included the Counter-Strike series, Quake series, StarCraft, and Warcraft.\n\nThe growth of esports in South Korea is thought to have been influenced by the mass building of broadband Internet networks following the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[42] It is also thought that the high unemployment rate at the time caused many people to look for things to do while out of work.[43] Instrumental to this growth of esports in South Korea was the prevalence of the Komany-style internet café/LAN gaming center, known as a PC bang. The Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, was founded in 2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country.[44] Minister of Culture, Sports, and Tourism Park Jie-won coined the term \"Esports\" at the founding ceremony of the 21st Century Professional Game Association (currently Korean e-Sports Association) in 2000.[45]\n\n\"Evo Moment 37\", also known as the \"Daigo Parry\", refers to a portion of a Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike semi-final match held at Evolution Championship Series 2004 (Evo 2004) between Daigo Umehara (playing Ken Masters) and Justin Wong (playing Chun-Li). During this match, Umehara made an unexpected comeback by parrying 15 consecutive hits of Wong's \"Super Art\" move while having only one pixel of vitality. Umehara subsequently won the match. \"Evo Moment #37\" is frequently described as the most iconic and memorable moment in the history of competitive video gaming. Being at one point the most-watched competitive gaming moment of all time, it has been compared to sports moments such as Babe Ruth's called shot and the Miracle on Ice.[46]\n\nIn April 2006, the G7 teams federation were formed by seven prominent Counter-Strike teams. The goal of the organization was to increase stability in the esports world, particularly in standardizing player transfers and working with leagues and organizations. The founding members were 4Kings, Fnatic, Made in Brazil, Mousesports, NiP, SK-Gaming, and Team 3D.[47] The organization only lasted until 2009 before dissolving.[48]\n\nThe 2000s was a popular time for televised esports. Television coverage was best established in South Korea, with StarCraft and Warcraft III competitions regularly televised by dedicated 24-hour cable TV game channels Ongamenet and MBCGame.[49] Elsewhere, esports television coverage was sporadic. The German GIGA Television covered esports until its shutdown in 2009. The United Kingdom satellite television channel XLEAGUE.TV broadcast esports competitions from 2007 to 2009. The online esports only channel ESL TV[50] briefly attempted a paid television model renamed GIGA II from June 2006 to autumn 2007. The French channel Game One broadcast esports matches in a show called Arena Online for the Xfire Trophy.[51] The United States channel ESPN2 hosted Madden NFL competitions in a show called Madden Nation from 2005 to 2008.[52] DirecTV broadcast the Championship Gaming Series tournament for two seasons in 2007 and 2008.[49] CBS aired prerecorded footage of the 2007 World Series of Video Games tournament that was held in Louisville, Kentucky.[53] The G4 television channel originally covered video games exclusively, but broadened its scope to cover technology and men's lifestyle, though has now shutdown.[49]\n\nDuring the 2010s, esports grew tremendously, incurring a large increase in both viewership and prize money.[54][55] Although large tournaments were founded before the 21st century, the number and scope of tournaments has increased significantly, going from about 10 tournaments in 2000 to about 260 in 2010.[6] Many successful tournaments were founded during this period, including the World Cyber Games, the Intel Extreme Masters, and Major League Gaming. The proliferation of tournaments included experimentation with competitions outside traditional esports genres. For example, the September 2006 FUN Technologies Worldwide Webgames Championship featured 71 contestants competing in casual games for a $1 million grand prize.[56]\n\nThe popularity and emergence of online streaming services have helped the growth of esports in this period, and are the most common method of watching tournaments. Twitch, an online streaming platform launched in 2011, routinely streams popular esports competitions. In 2013, viewers of the platform watched 12 billion minutes of video on the service, with the two most popular Twitch broadcasters being League of Legends and Dota 2.[57] During one day of The International, Twitch recorded 4.5 million unique views, with each viewer watching for an average of two hours.[6]\n\nThe modern esports boom has also seen a rise in video games companies embracing the esports potential of their products. After many years of ignoring and at times suppressing the esports scene, Nintendo hosted Wii Games Summer 2010. Spanning over a month, the tournament had over 400,000 participants, making it the largest and most expansive tournament in the company's history. In 2014 Nintendo hosted an invitational Super Smash Bros. for Wii U competitive tournament at the 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference that was streamed online on Twitch.[58] Halo developers 343 Industries announced in 2014 plans to revive Halo as an esport with the creation of the Halo Championship Series and a prize pool of US$50,000.[59] Both Blizzard Entertainment and Riot Games have their own collegiate outreach programs with their North American Collegiate Championship.[60][61] Since 2013 universities and colleges in the United States such as Robert Morris University Illinois and the University of Pikeville have recognized esports players as varsity level athletes and offer athletic scholarships.[62] In 2017, Tespa, Blizzard Entertainment's collegiate esports division, unveiled its new initiative to provide scholarships and prizes for collegiate esports clubs competing in its tournaments worth US$1 million.[63] Colleges have begun granting scholarships to students who qualify to play esports professionally for the school. Colleges such as Columbia College, Robert Morris University, and Indiana Institute of Technology have taken part in this.[64] In 2018, Harrisburg University of Science and Technology began a tuition scholarship program for esports players.[65]\n\nIn 2014, the largest independent esports league, Electronic Sports League, partnered with the local brand Japan Competitive Gaming to try and grow esports in the country.[66]\n\nPhysical viewership of esports competitions and the scope of events have increased in tandem with the growth of online viewership.[67] In 2013, the Season 3 League of Legends World Championship was held in a sold-out Staples Center.[68] The 2014 League of Legends World Championship in Seoul, South Korea, had over 40,000 fans in attendance and featured the band Imagine Dragons, and opening and closing ceremonies in addition to the competition.[69]\n\nIn 2015, the first Esports Arena was launched in Santa Ana, California, as the United States' first dedicated esports facility.[70]\n\nThe global esports audience reached 662.6 million in 2020, and 921 million in 2022.[71]\n\nIn 2021, China announced a law which forbade minors from playing video games, which they described as \"spiritual opium\", for more than three hours a week.[72] With China being a large market, the law raised concerns about the future of esports within the country.[73][74][75]\n\nLabeling competitive video games as a sport is a controversial topic.[76][77][78] Proponents[79] argue that esports are a fast-growing \"non-traditional sport\" which requires \"careful planning, precise timing, and skillful execution\".[80] Others claim that sports involve physical fitness and physical training, and prefer to classify esports as a mind sport.[81]\n\nFormer ESPN president John Skipper described esports in 2014 as a competition and \"not a sport\".[82][83][84][85][86][87] In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic.[88] In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected esports competitions of other genres.[89] In the 2015 World Championship hosted by the International Esports Federation, an esports panel of guests from international sports society discussed the future recognition of esports as a legitimate sport.[90]\n\nRussia was the first country that classified \"cybersport\" as an official sport discipline[91] on 25 July 2001.[92] After a series of reforms in Russian sports, it was classified as a sport again on 12 March 2004.[92][93][94][95] In July 2006, it was removed from a list of sport disciplines because it did not fit the new sport standards.[96][97] On 7 July 2016, The Ministry of Sport decided to add cybersport into the sport registry[98] and on 13 April 2017, esports become an official sport discipline once again.[citation needed]\n\nChina was another one of the first countries to recognize esports as a real sport in 2003,[99] despite concerns at the time that video games were addictive. Through this, the government encouraged esports, stating that by participating in esports, players were also \"training the body for China\".[100] Furthermore, by early 2019, China recognized esports players as an official profession within the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security's Occupation Skill Testing Authority recommendations, as well as professional gaming operators, those that distribute and manage esports games.[101] By July 2019, more than 100,000 people had registered themselves as professional gamers under this, with the Ministry stating that they anticipate over 2 million such people in this profession in five years.[102]\n\nIn 2013, Canadian League of Legends player Danny \"Shiphtur\" Le became the first pro gamer to receive an American P-1A visa, a category designated for \"Internationally Recognized Athletes\".[103][104] In 2014, Turkey's Ministry of Youth and Sports started issuing esports licenses to players certified as professionals.[105][106] In 2016, the French government started working on a project to regulate and recognize esports.[107] The Games and Amusements Board of the Philippines started issuing athletic licenses to Filipino esports players who are vouched for by a professional esports team in July 2017.[108][109]\n\nTo help promote esports as a legitimate sport, several esports events have been run alongside more traditional international sports competitions. The 2007 Asian Indoor Games was the first notable multi-sport competition including esports as an official medal-winning event, alongside other traditional sports, and the later editions of the Asian Indoor Games, as well as its successor the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games, have always included esports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now. Moreover, the Asian Games, which is the Asian top-level multi-sport competition, also included esports as a medal event at the 2022 edition; esports around games such as Hearthstone, Starcraft II, and League of Legends were presented as an exhibition event at the 2018 Asian Games as a lead-in to the 2022 games.[110][111] The 2019 Southeast Asian Games included six medal events for esports.[112] Since 2018, World Sailing has held an eSailing World Championship that showed a main sports federation embracing esports.[113] The Virtual Regatta race shadowing the 2020-2021 Vendee Globe was the first online game believe to have in excess of 1,000,000 unique users[114]\n\nAhead of The International 2021, which was originally set to take place in Stockholm in 2020, the Swedish Sports Confederation voted in June 2021 to deny recognition of esports as a sporting event, which jeopardized plans for how Valve had arranged the event in regards to travel visas for international players. Valve had tried to work with Sweden to accommodate players, but eventually rescheduled the event to Romania instead.[115][116]\n\nThe 2022 Commonwealth Games featured esports competitions as a pilot ahead of being a potential full medal event for 2026.[117]\n\nIn Greece, in March 2022 a law entered into force recognising and regulating esports[118] and in June 2023, the relevant federation for esports has been officially given recognition[119] and included in the list of sports federations.[120]\n\nThe Olympic Games are also seen as a potential method to legitimize esports. A summit held by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2017 acknowledged the growing popularity of esports, concluding that \"Competitive 'esports' could be considered as a sporting activity, and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports\" but would require any games used for the Olympics fitting \"with the rules and regulations of the Olympic movement\".[121] Another article by Andy Stout suggests that 106 million people viewed the 2017 Worlds Esports competition.[122] International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Thomas Bach has noted that the IOC is troubled by violent games and the lack of a global sanctioning body for esports.[123][111] Bach acknowledged that many Olympic sports originated from violent combat, but stated that \"sport is the civilized expression about this. If you have egames where it's about killing somebody, this cannot be brought into line with our Olympic values.\"[111] Due to that, the IOC suggested that they would approve more esports centered around games that simulate real sports, such as the NBA 2K or FIFA series.[124]\n\nThe issues around esports have not prevented the IOC from exploring what possibilities there are for incorporation into future Olympics. In July 2018, the IOC and the Global Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF) held a symposium and invited major figures in esports, including Epic Games' Mark Rein, Blizzard Entertainment's Mike Morhaime, and esports players Dario \"TLO\" Wünsch, Jacob \"Jake\" Lyon, and Se-yeon \"Geguri\" Kim, for these organizations \"to gain a deeper understanding of esports, their impact and likely future development, so that [they] can jointly consider the ways in which [they] may collaborate to the mutual benefit of all of sport in the years ahead\".[125][126] The IOC has tested the potential for esports through exhibition games. With support from the IOC, Intel sponsored exhibition esports events for StarCraft II and Steep prior to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, and five South Korean esports players were part of the Olympic Torch relay.[127][128] A similar exhibition showcase, the eGames, was held alongside the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, though this was not supported by the IOC.\n\nDuring the Eighth Olympic Summit in December 2019, the IOC reiterated that it would only consider sports-simulating games for any official Olympic event, but it would look at two paths for such games in the future: those that promoted good physical and mental health lifestyles, and virtual reality and augmented reality games that included physical activity.[129]\n\nIn the late 2010s, leaders in Japan became involved in helping bring esports to the 2020 Summer Olympics and beyond, given the country's reputation as a major video game industry centre. Esports in Japan had not flourished due to the country's anti-gambling laws that also prevent paid professional gaming tournaments, but there were efforts starting in late 2017 to eliminate this issue.[8] At the suggestion of the Tokyo Olympic Games Committee for the 2020 Summer Olympics, four esports organizations have worked with Japan's leading consumer organization to exempt esports tournaments from gambling law restrictions. Takeo Kawamura, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, led a coalition of ruling and opposing politicians to support esports, called the Japan esports Union, or JeSU.[130] Kawamura said that they would be willing to pass laws to further exempt esports as needed so that esports athletes can make a living playing these sports. So far, this has resulted in the ability of esports players to obtain exemption licenses to allow them to play, a similar mechanism needed for professional athletes in other sports in Japan to play professionally.[8] The first such licenses were given out in mid-July 2018, via a tournament held by several video game publishers to award prizes to many players but with JeSU offering these exemption licenses to the top dozen or so players that emerge, allowing them to compete in further esports events.[130] The Tokyo Olympic Committee has also planned to arrange a number of esports events leading up to the 2020 games.[8] With the IOC, five esports events were set as part of an Olympic Virtual Series from 13 May to 23 June 2021, ahead of the games. Each event in auto racing, baseball, cycling, rowing and sailing will be managed by an IOC-recognized governing body for the sport along with a video game publisher of a game for that sport. For example, the auto racing event will be based on the Gran Turismo series and overseen by the International Automobile Federation along with Polyphony Digital. The baseball, cycling, and esailing events will be based on eBaseball Powerful Pro Baseball 2020, Zwift, and Virtual Regatta, respectively.[131]\n\nThe organization committee for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris were in discussions with the IOC and the various professional esports organizations to consider esports for the event, citing the need to include these elements to keep the Olympics relevant to younger generations.[132] Ultimately, the organization committee determined esports were premature to bring to the 2024 Games as medal events, but have not ruled out other activities related to esports during the Games.[133]\n\nIn September 2021, the Olympic Council of Asia announced eight esports games will officially debut as medal sports for the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China.[134]\n\nIn December 2021, the IOC confirmed its Olympic Virtual Series (OVS) will return in 2022. The first edition of the OVS which ran from 13 May to 23 June, featured nearly 250,000 participants and had more than two million entries.[135]\n\nIn January 2022, the IOC announced the appointment of the organization's first ever head of virtual sport, tasked with the development of virtual sport for the global Olympic body, increasing the organization's engagement with gaming communities, and overseeing the Olympic Virtual Series, IOC's first licensed non-physical sports event. The inaugural series included virtual baseball, cycling, rowing, esailing and motorsports events.[136]\n\nIn February 2022, the Commonwealth Games Federation announced that esports would be included in the 2022 Commonwealth Games as a pilot event, with the possibility of it being a medal event in the 2026 Games.[137] The inaugural Commonwealth Esports Championship had separate branding, medals, and organization and included both men and women's Dota 2, eFootball, and Rocket League events.[138]\n\nAs a follow-up to 2021's Olympic Virtual Series, the IOC and the Singapore National Olympic Council held the inaugural Olympic Esports Week in Singapore in June 2023.[139] Games featured at the event included:[140][141][142]\n\nIn June 2024, the IOC Executive Board announced the proposal to establish the Olympic Esports Games during the 142nd IOC Session held prior to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, with the inaugural event to take place in 2025 at Saudi Arabia following a new partnership with their National Olympic Committee.[143][144] The proposal was ultimately approved by a unanimous vote on 23 July 2024.[145]\n\nA number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base. In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafés, with crucial influence on the development of esports worldwide. Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though the most popular games[citation needed] as of the early 2020s are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Fortnite, Rocket League, Valorant, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch.[146] Hearthstone has also popularized the digital collectible card game (DCCG) genre since its release in 2014.[147]\n\nWhile it is common for video games to be designed with the experience of the player in game being the only priority, many successful esports games have been designed to be played professionally from the beginning. Developers may decide to add dedicated esports features, or even make design compromises to support high level competition. Games such as StarCraft II,[148] League of Legends,[149] and Dota 2[150] have all been designed, at least in part, to support professional competition.\n\nIn addition to allowing players to participate in a given game, many game developers have added dedicated observing features for the benefit of spectators. This can range from simply allowing players to watch the game unfold from the competing player's point of view, to a highly modified interface that gives spectators access to information even the players may not have. The state of the game viewed through this mode may tend to be delayed by a certain amount of time in order to prevent either teams in a game from gaining a competitive advantage. Games with these features include Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty,[151] StarCraft II,[152][153] Dota 2,[154] and Counter-Strike.[155] League of Legends includes spectator features, which are restricted to custom game modes.[156][157]\n\nIn response to the release of virtual reality headsets in 2016, some games, such as Dota 2, were updated to include virtual reality spectating support.[158]\n\nA very common method for connection is the Internet. Game servers are often separated by region, but high quality connections allow players to set up real-time connections across the world. Downsides to online connections include increased difficulty detecting cheating compared to physical events, and greater network latency, which can negatively impact players' performance, especially at high levels of competition. Many competitions take place online, especially for smaller tournaments and exhibition games.\n\nSince the 1990s, professional teams or organized clans have set up matches via Internet Relay Chat networks such as QuakeNet. As esports have developed, it has also become common for players to use automated matchmaking clients built into the games themselves. This was popularized by the 1996 release of Blizzard's Battle.net, which has been integrated into both the Warcraft and StarCraft series. Automated matchmaking has become commonplace in console gaming as well, with services such as Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network. After competitors have contacted each other, the game is often managed by a game server, either remotely to each of the competitors, or running on one of the competitor's machines.\n\nAdditionally, competitions are also often conducted over a local area network or LAN. The smaller network usually has very little lag and higher quality. Because competitors must be physically present, LANs help ensure fair play by allowing direct scrutiny of competitors. This helps prevent many forms of cheating, such as unauthorized hardware or software modding. The physical presence of competitors helps create a more social atmosphere at LAN events. Many gamers organize LAN parties or visit Internet cafés, and most major tournaments are conducted over LANs.\n\nIndividual games have taken various approaches to LAN support. In contrast to the original StarCraft, StarCraft II was released without support for LAN play, drawing some strongly negative reactions from players.[159] League of Legends was originally released for online play only, but announced in October 2012 that a LAN client was in the works for use in major tournaments.[160] In September 2013, Valve added general support for LAN play to Dota 2 in a patch for the game.[161]\n\nProfessional gamers are often associated with esports teams or broader gaming and entertainment organizations. Teams such as FaZe Clan, Cloud9, Fnatic, T1, G2 Esports, and Natus Vincere have become successful within esports and now sponsor esports players around the world.[162][163] These teams often cover multiple esports games within tournaments and leagues, with various team makeups for each game. They may also represent single players for one-on-one esports games like fighting games within Evolution Championship Series, or Hearthstone tournaments. In addition to prize money from tournament wins, players in these teams and associations may also be paid a separate team salary. Team sponsorship may cover tournament travel expenses or gaming hardware. Prominent esports sponsors include companies such as Logitech and Razer.[164] Teams feature these sponsors on their website, team jerseys and on their social media, in 2016 the biggest teams have social media followings of over a million.[165] Associations include the Korean e-Sports Association (KeSPA), the International e-Sports Federation (IeSF), the British esports Association, and the World esports Association (WESA).\n\nSome traditional sporting athletes have invested in esports, such as Rick Fox's ownership of Echo Fox,[166] Jeremy Lin's ownership of Team VGJ,[167] and Shaquille O'Neal's investment in NRG Esports.[168] Some association football teams, such as FC Schalke 04 in Germany,[169] Paris Saint-Germain esports in France;[170] Besiktas JK, Fenerbahce S.K., and Galatasaray in Turkey; Panathinaikos F.C. in Greece either sponsor or have complete ownership in esports teams.[171]\n\nCompetitive Esports tournaments in the most popular games pay hundreds to thousands of dollars to players for winning tournaments.[172] Dota 2's 2021 tournament The International had a prize pool over $40 million, the largest in esports history, thanks to its Compendium battle pass contributing a portion of its sales to it. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive had a total 2021 prize pool, across all tournaments, of around $22 million.[173] The current biggest esports tournament by prize pool, the King Pro League Grand Finals for Honor of Kings, provides just under US$10 million for the twelve teams that take part.[174] However, financial security in the industry is largely limited to players in top performing teams. One study found that only 1 in 5 professional gamers have careers that last longer than two years.[175] Team rosters are extremely volatile, sometimes changing players or rosters within a season.[176]\n\nWhile different from the regimens of traditional sports, esports athletes still have extensive training routines. Team Liquid's professional League of Legends team practices for a minimum of 50 hours per week and most play the game far more.[177] In April 2020, researchers from the Queensland University of Technology found that some of the top esports players showed similar aspects of mental toughness as Olympic athletes.[178][179] This training schedule for players has resulted in many of them retiring an early age. Players are generally in competition by their mid- to late-teens, with most retiring by their late-20s.[180]\n\nThere is a long history of different esports teams or certain players in leagues that aren't exactly the same as most players. For example, there are many esports organizations or teams that are entirely made up of players that have physical disabilities. Permastunned and ParaEsports are great examples of this where ParaEsports is completely composed of professional CSGO players that have cerebral palsy. Whilst these teams aren't in many cases very successful in the major leagues of their respective esports, there are certain leagues or tournaments that are restricted to only have teams or players like these be able to compete. Although these teams or tournaments don't get nearly as much attention, budget, or prize pool as the main leagues of popular esports, it is still important to recognize these amazing players that have overcome their unfortunate positions and strive to succeed.\n\nIn most team-based esports, organized play is centered around the use of promotion and relegation to move sponsored teams between leagues within the competition's organization based on how the team fared in matches; this follows patterns of professional sports in European and Asian countries. Teams will play a number of games across a season as to vie for top positioning in the league by the end of that season. Those that do well, in addition to prize money, may be promoted into a higher-level league, while those that fare poorly can be regulated downward. For example, until 2018 Riot Games ran several League of Legends series, with the League of Legends Championship Series being the top-tier series. Teams that did not do well were relegated to the League of Legends Challenger Series, replaced by the better performing teams from that series. This format was discontinued when Riot opted to use the franchise format in mid-2018, but the promotion and relegation format still exists within Southeast Asia's Pacific Championship Series and in North America's new tier 2 league, the North American Challengers Series, as of 2024.\n\nWith rising interest in viewership of esports, some companies sought to create leagues that followed the franchise approach used in North American professional sports, in which all teams, backed by a major financial sponsor to support the franchise, participate in a regular season of matches to vie for top standing as to participate in the post-season games. This approach is more attractive for larger investors, who would be more willing to back a team that remains playing in the esport's premiere league and not threatened to be relegated to a lower standing.[181] Though the details vary from league to league, these leagues generally require all signed player to have a minimum salary with appropriate benefits, and may share in the team's winnings. While there is no team promotion or relegation, players can be signed onto contracts, traded among teams, or let go as free agents, and new players may be pulled from the esports' equivalent minor league.\n\nThe first such league to be formed was the Overwatch League, established by Blizzard Entertainment in 2016 based on its Overwatch game.[182] Initially launched in 2018 with 12 teams, the league expanded to twenty teams in 2019. Though the first two seasons were played at Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, the Overwatch League's third season in 2020 will implement the typical home/away game format at esports arenas in the teams' various home cities or regions.[183] The OWL would fold in 2023 and would be replaced by a more open esports structure for Overwatch known as the Overwatch Champions Series.[184][185]\n\nTake-Two Interactive partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to create the NBA 2K League, using the NBA 2K game series. It is the first esports league to be operated by a professional sports league, and the NBA sought to have a League team partially sponsored by each of the 30 professional NBA teams. Its inaugural season started in May 2018 with 17 teams and the league has since expanded to 25 teams, including teams owned by Gen.G and Australia's National Basketball League.[186][187]\n\nSimilar to the NBA 2K League, EA Sports and Major League Soccer (MLS) established the eMLS in 2018, a league using EA's FIFA (Now known as EA Sports FC) series.[188] EA would later establish esports leagues with other professional football leagues, ranging from the English Premier League to the Saudi Pro League, which would feed into qualification for the FIFAe World Cup and later the EA Sports FC Pro World Championship.\n\nActivision launched its 12-team Call of Duty League in January 2020, following the format of the Overwatch League but based on the Call of Duty series.[183]\n\nCloud9 and Dignitas, among others, developed a franchise-based Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league, Flashpoint, in February 2020. This was the first such esports league to be owned by the teams rather than any single organization.[189] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other complications, Flashpoint would be discontinued by 2022.[190]\n\nEsports are also frequently played in tournaments, where potential players and teams vie to be placed through qualification matches before entering the tournament. From there, the tournament formats can vary from single or double elimination, sometimes hybridized with group stage.[191] Esports tournaments are almost always physical events in which occur in front of a live audience, with referees or officials to monitor for cheating. The tournament may be part of a larger gathering, such as Dreamhack, or the competition may be the entirety of the event, like the World Cyber Games or the Fortnite World Cup. Esports competitions have also become a popular feature at gaming and multi-genre conventions.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough competitions involving video games have long existed, esports underwent a significant transition in the late 1990s. Beginning with the Cyberathlete Professional League in 1997, tournaments became much larger, and corporate sponsorship became more common. Increasing viewership both in person and online brought esports to a wider audience.[5][192] Major tournaments include the World Cyber Games, the North American Major League Gaming league, the France-based Electronic Sports World Cup, and the World e-Sports Games held in Hangzhou, China.\n\nThe average compensation for professional esports players does not compare to those of the top classical sports organizations in the world. According to Julian Krinsky Camps & Programs website, the top Esports player in the world earned around $2.5 million in 2017.[193][better source needed] The highest overall salary by any esports professional at the time was around $3.6 million. While prizes for esports competitions can be very large, the limited number of competitions and large number of competitors ultimately lowers the amount of money one can make in the industry. In the United States, Esports competitions have prizes that can reach $200,000 for a single victory. Dota 2 International hosted a competition where the grand-prize winning team walked home with almost $10.9 million.[193]\n\nFor well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year.[194][195] As of 10 September 2016, Dota 2 has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million. League of Legends awarded approximately $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, but in addition to the prize money, Riot Games provides salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series.[196] Nonetheless, there has been criticism to how these salaries are distributed, since most players earn a fairly low wage but a few top players have a significantly higher salary, skewing the average earning per player.[197] In August 2018, The International 2018, Valve's annual premier Dota 2 tournament, was held and broke the record for holding the largest prize pool to date for any esports tournament, amounting to over US$25 million.[198]\n\nOften, game developers provide prize money for tournament competition directly,[194] but sponsorship may also come from third parties, typically companies selling computer hardware, energy drinks, or computer software. Generally, hosting a large esports event is not profitable as a stand-alone venture.[199] For example, Riot has stated that their headline League of Legends Championship Series is \"a significant investment that we're not making money from\".[200]\n\nThere is considerable variation and negotiation over the relationship between video game developers and tournament organizers and broadcasters. While the original StarCraft events emerged in South Korea largely independently of Blizzard, the company decided to require organizers and broadcasters to authorize events featuring the sequel StarCraft II.[201] In the short term, this led to a deadlock with the Korean e-Sports Association.[202] An agreement was reached in 2012.[203] Blizzard requires authorization for tournaments with more than US$10,000 in prizes.[204] Riot Games offers in-game rewards to authorized tournaments.[205]\n\nThe increasing popularity of esports brought with it a demand for extended opportunities for esports athletes. Esports clubs grew in popularity at American universities in the late 2000s and early 2010s, with StarCraft clubs competing by 2009.[206][207] Universities, particularly in China and America, then began offering scholarship opportunities to incoming students to join collegiate esports teams. The first officially recognized varsity esports program was created at Robert Morris University in 2014.[208][209][210] As of 2019, around 125 US colleges had esports-based varsity programs. Most of these are members of the National Association of Collegiate Esports.[211]\n\nThe UK's National University Esports League (NUEL) started in 2010. In 2023, it was taken over by Spanish Esports company GGTech Entertainment.[212][213] As of 2024, it had been rebranded as University Esports UK & Ireland and had over 110 participating universities.[214] Another university competition in the UK is the British Universities Esports Championship, run by National Student Esports (NSE), which also had over 110 participating universities and colleges as of 2024 . The University of Warwick won its sixth consecutive NES Esports University of the Year title in 2024.[215] The two organisations are not exclusive, with universities able to field teams in both NUEL and NSE competitions.[216] For younger students, the British Esports Student Champs had over 1,250 teams from over 200 schools and colleges as of 2024 .[217] Collegiate universities such as Durham and multi-campus universities such as Staffordshire also hold inter-collegiate or inter-campus tournaments.[218][219]\n\nAccording to Schaeperkoetter and collaborators in 2017, the potential impact of esports programs on universities, coupled with the growing interest that universities were showing in such programs, combined to make esports a relevant line of research in sport literature.[220]\n\nWhile game publishers or esports broadcasters typically act in oversight roles for specific esports, a number of esports governing bodies have been established to collectively represent esports on a national, regional or global basis. These governing bodies may have various levels of involvement with the esport, from being part of esports regulation to simply acting more as a trade group and public face for esports.\n\nThe International Esports Federation (IESF) was one of the first such bodies. Originally formed in 2008 to help promote esports in the Southeast Asian region, it has grown to include over 140 member countries from across the globe. The IESF has managed annual World Esports Championships for teams from its member countries across multiple games.[221]\n\nThe European Esports Federation was formed in April 2019 and includes UK, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France, Russia, Slovenia, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine. This body was designed more to be a managing partner for other esports, working to coordinate event structures and regulations across multiple esports.[222]\n\nAdditionally, trade groups representing video games have also generally acted as governing bodies for esports. Notably, in November 2019, five major national trade organizations – the Entertainment Software Association in the United States, the Entertainment Software Association of Canada, The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment, Interactive Software Federation of Europe, and the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association of Australian and New Zealand – issued a joined statement for supporting the promotion and participation of esports to respect player safety and integrity, respect and diversity among players, and enriching game play.[223]\n\nMost esports generally require participants to sit and/or move little while playing, which raises concerns about a sedentary lifestyle by players. A research led by Ingo Froböse, a professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, for over eight years found professional and also amateur esports gamers play on average 24–25 hours per week and even physical activities after hours of playing are not able to compensate the damage of oversitting. Players in China may train for almost 14 hours a day. A study conducted in 2022 of CS:GO players found that total hours played were about 31.2 hours each week.[224] Sitting for long periods at a computer could lead to eye fatigue and lower back pain from poor posture. Gamers with poor posture sit in forward head posture which can cause symptoms such as decreased arm or shoulder mobility and tension headaches.[225] These sedentary behaviors of sitting for too long concerns public health researchers because spending more than 6–8 hours per day has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.[226] As a result, teams like T1 have partnered with Nike to encourage exercise and provide training that helps improve gaming skills.[227] Recent research has also shown that structured esports activities can foster teamwork, problem-solving skills, and promote digital literacy among participants, though concerns about sedentary behavior and mental health risks persist.[228]\n\nIn addition to sedentary behaviors, players' mental health is a concern for scientists. One study found that competitors in esports are often under psychological and physical stress, and the amateur ones are the most affected, since they frequently aim at greater wins without enough preparation, though no clear training guidelines are set to become professional players.[229][230] Researchers have found that high levels of stress lead to mental illness and poor decision making.[231] The Esports sector has a high rate of burnout due to mental health and stress. A study found a correlation between depression and training time leading to sleep disturbances.[232] Teams are starting to incorporate mental health support for players. Misfits has hired a psychologist to ensure players are equipped with methods to deal with stress and anxiety.[233]\n\nEsports athletes are usually obligated to behave ethically, abiding by both the explicit rules set out by tournaments, associations, and teams, as well as following general expectations of good sportsmanship. For example, it is common practice and considered good etiquette to send a \"gg\" (good game) message to opponents when defeated.[234] Many games rely on competitors having limited information about the game state. In a prominent example of good conduct, during a 2012 IEM StarCraft II game, players Feast and DeMusliM voluntarily offered information about their strategies to negate the influence of outside information inadvertently leaked to Feast during the game.[235] Players in some leagues have been reprimanded for failing to meet expectations of good behavior. In 2012, professional League of Legends player Christian \"IWillDominate\" Riviera was banned from competing for one year following a history of verbal abuse.[236] In 2013, StarCraft II progamer Greg \"Idra\" Fields was fired from Evil Geniuses for insulting his fans on the Team Liquid internet forums.[237] League of Legends players Mithy and Nukeduck received similar penalties in 2014 after behaving in a \"toxic\" manner during matches.[238]\n\nThe formation of Team Siren, an all-female League of Legends team, in June 2013 was met with controversy and dismissed as a \"gimmick\" to attract men's attention.[239][240] The team disbanded within a month due to negative publicity from their promotional video and the team captain's poor attitude towards her teammates.[241][242] In 2018, Team Vaevictis attempted to field an all-female roster in the LCL, the top esports league in Russia,[243] but faced similar criticism.[244] Vaevictis went 0–14 in both splits, and in February 2020, the LCL announced their disbandment due to a failure to field a competitive roster.[245][246][247] The LCL stated, \"The results of the 2019 season showed a huge difference in Vaevictis Esports' results compared to other LCL teams, which is an unacceptable level of competitiveness in a franchised league.\"\n\nThere have been serious rule violations in certain esports. In 2010, eleven StarCraft: Brood War players were found guilty of fixing matches for profit and were fined and banned from future competition. Team Curse and Team Dignitas were denied prize money for collusion during the 2012 MLG Summer Championship.[248] In 2012, League of Legends team Azubu Frost was fined US$30,000 for cheating during a semifinal match of the world playoffs.[249] Dota 2 player Aleksey \"Solo\" Berezin was suspended from several tournaments for intentionally throwing a game to collect $322 from online gambling.[250] In 2014, four high-profile North American Counter-Strike players from iBuyPower were suspended from official tournaments after being found guilty of match-fixing, allegedly profiting over US$10,000 through betting on their fixed matches.[251] Gambling on esports using Counter-Strike: Global Offense \"skins\", worth an estimated US$2.3 billion in 2015, came under criticism in June and July 2016 after several questionable legal and ethical aspects were discovered.[252]\n\nReports of widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in esports are not uncommon, with players discussing their own, their teammates' and their competitors' use as well as officials acknowledging the prevalence of the issue.[253][254][255] Players often turn to stimulants such as Ritalin, Adderall and Vyvanse, drugs which can significantly boost concentration, improve reaction time, and prevent fatigue.[253] Selegiline, a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, is reportedly popular, because like stimulants, it enhances mood and motivation. Conversely, drugs with calming effects are also sought after. Some players take propranolol, which blocks the effects of adrenaline, or Valium, which is prescribed to treat anxiety disorder, in order to remain calm under pressure.[254] According to Bjoern Franzen, a former SK Gaming executive, it is second nature for some League of Legends players to take as many as three different drugs before competition.[256] In July 2015 Kory \"Semphis\" Friesen, an ex-Cloud9 player, admitted that he and his teammates were all using Adderall during a match against Virtus.pro in the ESL One Katowice 2015 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournament, and went on to claim that \"everyone\" at ESEA League tournaments uses Adderall.[255] In 2020, former Call of Duty champion Adam \"KiLLa\" Sloss told The Washington Post that one of the major reasons he stopped competing in esports was the \"rampant\" use of Adderall in the competitive scene.[257]\n\nThe unregulated use of such drugs poses severe risks to competitors' health, including addiction, overdose, serotonin syndrome and, in the case of stimulants, weight loss.[253][254] Accordingly, Adderall and other such stimulants are banned and their use penalized by many professional sporting bodies and leagues, including Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Although International e-Sports Federation (IeSF) is a signatory of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the governing body has not outlawed any PEDs in its sanctioned competitions.[253] Action has been taken on the individual league level, however, as at least one major league, the Electronic Sports League, has made use of any drugs during matches punishable by expulsion from competition.[258] Although not all players use drugs, the use of over-the-counter energy drinks is common. These energy drinks are often marketed specifically toward gamers, and have also faced media and regulatory scrutiny due to their health risks.[259]\n\nThere has been some concern over the quality of life and potential mistreatment of players by organizations, especially in South Korea. Korean organizations have been accused of refusing to pay competitive salaries, leading to a slow exodus of Korean players to other markets. In an interview, League of Legends player Bae \"Dade\" Eo-jin said that \"Korean players wake up at 1 pm and play until 5 am\", and suggested that the 16-hour play schedule was a significant factor in causing burnout.[260] Concerns over the mental health of players intensified in 2014 when League of Legends player Cheon \"Promise\" Min-Ki attempted suicide a week after admitting to match fixing.[261]\n\nTo combat the negative environment, Korean League of Legends teams were given new rules for the upcoming 2015 season by Riot Games, including the adoption of minimum salaries for professional players, requiring contracts and allowing players to stream individually for additional player revenue.[262]\n\nSince esports games often requires many actions per minute, some players may get repetitive strain injuries, causing hand or wrist pain.[263] During the early development of the esports industry, sports medicine and gaming-related injuries were ignored by players and organizations, leading to some early player retirements.[264]\n\nThe League of Legends Championship Series and League of Legends Champions Korea offer guaranteed salaries for players.[265] Despite this, online streaming is preferred by some players, as in some cases, streaming can be more profitable than competing with a team, and streamers have the ability to determine their own schedule. The International tournament awards US$10 million to the winners, however teams that do not have the same amount of success often do not have financial stability and frequently break up after failing to win.[266]\n\nIn 2015 it was estimated by SuperData Research, that the global esports industry generated revenue of around US$748.8 million that year. Asia is the leading esports market with over $321 million in revenue, with North America at around $224 million, and Europe at $172 million. For comparison, the rest of the world combines for approximately $29 million.[267] Global esports revenue is estimated to reach $1.9 billion by 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the video gaming industry bypassed many economic sectors by providing a means of compensating for the physical isolation imposed by the lockdown, transforming it into an increasingly important economic sector within the global economy.[268]\n\nThe number of female viewers has been growing in esports, with an estimated 30% of esports viewers being female in 2013, a significant increase from 15% the previous year.[citation needed] However, despite the increase in female viewers, there is not a growth of female players in high level competitive esports.[citation needed] The top female players that are involved in esports mainly get exposure in female-only tournaments, most notably Counter-Strike, Dead or Alive 4, and StarCraft II. Current all-female esports teams include Frag Dolls and PMS Clan.[citation needed]\n\nGambling on esports matches have historically been illegal or unregulated by major markets. This created a black market via virtual currency. In places where esports gambling is not officially recognized, the lack of regulation has resulted in match-fixing by players or third parties, and created issues with underage gambling due to the draw of video games. Some games allow bets in their in-game currency,[269] while third-party gambling platforms will often take bets placed using virtual items earned in games.[270] In esports gambling, most bets and odds are structured in the same way as traditional sports. Most gambling sites offering the booker service allow users to bet based on the outcome of tournaments, matches or special esports titles. On the other hand, due to the nature of esports, there are numerous innovative ways to make bets, which are based on in-game milestones.[271] For example, League of Legend bettors may place their money on which team/champion will take the \"First Blood\".[272]\n\nEsports gambling in the United States has been illegal under the federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA). The Act prevented all but five states from allowing gambling on sporting events.[270] However, regulation of esports betting still depended on state law. Some betting houses in Nevada, where sports betting has been already exempted under PASPA, classify esports as non-competitive \"other events\" similar to the selection of the Heisman Trophy winner or NFL Draft which are considered as legal.[270] Other companies established in the United States allow betting on esports to international users but are restricted to Americans. Nevada legalized esports gambling in June 2017, classifying esports along with competitive sports and dog racing.[273] With the Supreme Court of the United States's ruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association in May 2018, PASPA was recognized as unconstitutional, as the Court claimed that the federal government cannot limit states from regulating sports betting. This created the potential for legalized esports-based betting in the United States.[274] However, New Jersey, the state at the center of the Supreme Court case, passed its bill to legalize sports gambling but restricted gambling on esports to only international competitions where most players are over 18 years of age.[275] Without PASPA, interstate gambling on esports would be still be limited by the Federal Wire Act, preventing users from betting on national esports events outside of the state.[270]\n\nIn 2019, the countries where esports gambling is legal include the UK, New Zealand, Australia, China, Spain, Canada, South Korea, and Japan, and many of them are the international hosts for gaming tournaments.[276] By the end of 2019, the state of New Jersey approved esports betting, just in time for the finals of the LoL Worlds Cup 2019 final match, which had over 4.000.000 spectators.[277]\n\nThe esports gambling industry has attracted criticism because of its target audience. As a large part of the esports audience is underage, governments and regulators have expressed skepticism regarding the market and the possibility of underage gambling. Additionally, gambling platforms have received criticism for their integration with the larger esports industry.[278] Esports platforms regularly sponsor professional esports teams, as happened with the contract between Betway and PSG.LGD team (Dota 2) in August 2019.[279]\n\nWith the growing popularity of machine learning in data analytics,[citation needed] esports has been the focus of several software programs that analyze the plethora of game data available. Based on the huge number of matches played on a daily basis globally (League of Legends alone had a reported 100 million active monthly players worldwide in 2016[280] and an average of 27 million League of Legends games played per day reported in 2014[281]), these games can be used for applying big-data machine learning platforms. Several games make their data publicly available, so websites aggregate the data into easy-to-visualize graphs and statistics. In addition, several programs use machine learning tools to predict the win probability of a match based on various factors, such as team composition.[282] In 2018, the DotA team Team Liquid partnered with a software company to allow players and coaches to predict the team's success rate in each match and provide advice on what needs to be changed to improve performance.[283]\n\nAs more esports competitions and leagues are run entirely or in portion by the video game publisher or developer for the game, the ongoing viability of that game's esports activities is tied to that company. In December 2018, Blizzard announced that it was reducing resources spent on the development of Heroes of the Storm and canceling its plans for tournaments in 2019. This caused several professional Heroes players and coaches to recognize that their career was no longer viable, and expressed outrage and disappointment at Blizzard's decision.[284][285]\n\nThe main medium for esports coverage is the Internet. In the mid-2010s, mainstream sports and news reporting websites, such as ESPN, Yahoo!, Sport1, Kicker, and Aftonbladet started dedicated esports coverage.[286][287] esports tournaments commonly use commentators or casters to provide live commentary of games in progress, similar to a traditional sports commentator. For popular casters, providing commentary for esports can be a full-time position by itself.[288] Prominent casters for StarCraft II include Dan \"Artosis\" Stemkoski and Nick \"Tasteless\" Plott. However, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic affected how esports were covered in addition to the sports themselves. Notably, ESPN's dedicated esports coverage was shuttered in November 2020 as the network refocus on more traditional sports, though said they would still have some coverage of esports events.[289]\n\nIn 2018, the Associated Press' AP Stylebook officially began spelling the word as \"esports\", dropping support for both the capital \"S\" and the dash between \"e\" and \"sports\" styles, similar to how \"e-mail\" transformed with common usage to \"email\".[290][291] Richard Tyler Blevins, better known as \"Ninja\", became the first professional gamer to appear in a cover story for a major sports magazine when he appeared in the September 2018 issue of ESPN The Magazine.[292]\n\nMany esports events are streamed online to viewers over the internet. With the shutdown of the Own3d streaming service in 2013, Twitch is by far the most popular streaming service for esports, competing against other providers such as Hitbox.tv, Azubu, and YouTube Gaming.[293][294] Dreamhack Winter 2011 reached 1.7 million unique viewers on Twitch.[295] While coverage of live events usually brings in the largest viewership counts, the recent popularization of streaming services has allowed individuals to broadcast their own gameplay independent of such events as well. Individual broadcasters can enter an agreement with Twitch or Hitbox in which they receive a portion of the advertisement revenue from commercials which run on the stream they create.[296]\n\nAnother major streaming platform was Major League Gaming's MLG.tv.[297] The network, which specializes in Call of Duty content but hosts a range of gaming titles, has seen increasing popularity, with 1376% growth in MLG.tv viewership in Q1 of 2014.[298] The 2014 Call of Duty: Ghosts broadcast at MLG's X Games event drew over 160,000 unique viewers.[299] The network, like Twitch, allows users to broadcast themselves playing games, though only select individuals can use the service. For several years, MLG.tv was the primary streaming platform for the Call of Duty professional scene; famous players such as NaDeSHoT and Scump have signed contracts with the company to use its streaming service exclusively.[300] In January 2016, MLG was acquired by Activision Blizzard.[301]\n\nYouTube also relaunched its livestreaming platform with a renewed focus on live gaming and esports specifically.[302] For The International 2014, coverage was also simulcast on ESPN's streaming service ESPN3.[303] In December 2016, Riot Games announced a deal with MLB Advanced Media's technology division BAM Tech for the company to distribute and monetize broadcasts of League of Legends events through 2023. BAM Tech will pay Riot at least $300 million per-year, and split advertising revenue.[304][305]\n\nEspecially since the popularization of streaming in esports, organizations no longer prioritize television coverage, preferring online streaming websites such as Twitch. Ongamenet continues to broadcast as an esports channel in South Korea, but MBCGame was taken off the air in 2012. Riot Games' Dustin Beck stated that \"TV's not a priority or a goal\",[306] and DreamHack's Tomas Hermansson said \"esports have [been proven] to be successful on internet streaming [services].\"[307]\n\nOn the night before the finals of The International 2014 in August, ESPN3 broadcast a half-hour special profiling the tournament.[303] In 2015, ESPN2 broadcast Heroes of the Dorm, the grand finals of the Heroes of the Storm collegiate tournament. The first-place team from the University of California, Berkeley received tuition for each of the team's players, paid for by Blizzard and Tespa.[308] The top four teams won gaming equipment and new computers. This was the first time an esport had ever been broadcast on a major American television network. The broadcast was an attempt to broaden the appeal of esports by reaching viewers who would not normally come across it. However, the broadcast was met with a few complaints. Those living outside of the United States were unable to view the tournament. Additionally, the tournament could not be viewed online via streams, cutting off a large portion of viewers from the main demographic in the process.[309]\n\nIn September 2015, Turner Broadcasting partnered with WME/IMG. In December 2015, the partnered companies announced two seasons of the ELeague, a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive league based in North America including 15 teams from across the world competing for a $1,200,000 prize pool each 10-week season. The tournament, filmed at Turner's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, was simultaneously streamed on online streaming websites and TBS on Friday nights.[310]\n\nIn January 2016, Activision Blizzard, publishers of the Call of Duty and StarCraft series, acquired Major League Gaming. In an interview with The New York Times about the purchase, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick explained that the company was aspiring to create a U.S. cable network devoted to esports, which he described as \"the ESPN of video games\". He felt that higher quality productions, more in line with those of traditional sports telecasts, could help to broaden the appeal of esports to advertisers.

He is known for his prolific output across a variety of instruments and forms, including the orchestral Brandenburg Concertos; solo instrumental works such as the cello suites and sonatas and partitas for solo violin; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and choral works such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach Revival, he has been widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.[3]\n\nThe Bach family already had several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician, Johann Ambrosius, in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother, Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical education in Lüneburg. In 1703 he returned to Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen, and for longer periods at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and Köthen, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. In 1723 he was hired as Thomaskantor (cantor at St Thomas's) in Leipzig. There he composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city and its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. In 1726 he began publishing his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer. This situation was somewhat remedied when his sovereign, Augustus III of Poland, granted him the title of court composer in 1736. In the last decades of his life, Bach reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after a botched eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.\n\nBach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation,[4] and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly Italy and France. His compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works but, for instance, also in his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. Bach wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works use contrapuntal techniques like canon and fugue.\n\nIn the 18th century Bach was primarily known as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as The Well-Tempered Clavier, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some significant Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals (and later also websites) exclusively devoted to him and other publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the Air on the G String and \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", and of recordings such as three different box sets with complete performances of his oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach[n 1] was born in Eisenach, the capital of the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, in present-day Germany, on 21 March 1685 O.S. (31 March 1685 N.S.). He was the eighth and youngest child of Johann Ambrosius Bach, the director of the town musicians, and Maria Elisabeth Lämmerhirt. His father likely taught him violin and basic music theory. His uncles were all professional musicians who worked as church organists, court chamber musicians, and composers. One uncle, Johann Christoph Bach, introduced him to the organ, and an older second cousin, Johann Ludwig Bach, was a well-known composer and violinist.[n 2]\n\nBach's mother died in 1694, and his father died eight months later. The 10-year-old Bach moved in with his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach, the organist at St. Michael's Church in Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. There he studied, performed, and copied music, including his brother's, despite being forbidden to do so because scores were so valuable and private and blank ledger paper was costly. He received valuable teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord. Johann Christoph exposed him to the works of great composers of the day, including South Germans such as Johann Caspar Kerll, Johann Jakob Froberger, and Johann Pachelbel (under whom Johann Christoph had studied); North Germans; Frenchmen such as Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand, and Marin Marais; and the Italian Girolamo Frescobaldi. He learned theology, Latin and Greek at the local gymnasium.\n\nBy 3 April 1700, Bach and his school friend Georg Erdmann—who was two years older than Bach—studied at St. Michael's School in Lüneburg, some two weeks' travel north of Ohrdruf.[21] Their journey was probably undertaken mostly on foot.[21] His two years there were critical in exposing Bach to a broader range of European culture. In addition to singing in the choir, he played the school's three-manual organ and harpsichords.[22] He also came into contact with sons of aristocrats from northern Germany who had been sent to the nearby Ritter-Academie to prepare for careers in other disciplines.\n\nIn January 1703, shortly after graduating from St. Michael's and being turned down for the post of organist at Sangerhausen, Bach was appointed court musician in the chapel of Duke Johann Ernst III in Weimar. His role there is unclear, but it probably included menial, non-musical duties. During his seven-month tenure at Weimar, his reputation as a keyboardist spread so widely that he was invited to inspect the new organ and give the inaugural recital at the New Church (now Bach Church) in Arnstadt, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) southwest of Weimar. On 14 August 1703, he became the organist at the New Church, with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a new organ tuned in a temperament that allowed music written in a wider range of keys to be played.\n\nDespite strong family connections and a musically enthusiastic employer, tension built up between Bach and the authorities after several years in the post. Bach felt discontented by the calibre of musicians he was collaborating with. He called one of them, Geyersbach, a \"Zippel Fagottist\" (weenie bassoonist). Late one evening, Geyersbach went after Bach with a stick. Bach filed a complaint against Geyersbach with the authorities. They acquitted Geyersbach with a minor reprimand and ordered Bach to be more moderate about the musical qualities he expected from his students. Some months later, Bach upset his employer with a prolonged absence from Arnstadt: after obtaining leave for four weeks, he was absent for around four months in 1705–1706 to take lessons from the organist and composer Johann Adam Reincken and to hear him and Dieterich Buxtehude play in the northern city of Lübeck. The visit to Buxtehude and Reincken involved a 450-kilometre (280 mi) journey each way, reportedly on foot.[28][29] Buxtehude probably introduced Bach to his friend Reincken so that he could learn from his compositional technique (especially his mastery of fugue), his organ playing and his skills with improvisation. Bach knew Reincken's music very well; he copied Reincken's monumental An Wasserflüssen Babylon when he was 15 years old. Bach later wrote several other works on the same theme. When Bach revisited Reincken in 1720 and showed him his improvisatory skills on the organ, Reincken reportedly remarked: \"I thought that this art was dead, but I see that it lives in you.\"[30]\n\nIn 1706, Bach applied for a post as organist at the Blasius Church in Mühlhausen.[31] As part of his application, he had a cantata performed on Easter, 24 April 1707, likely an early version of his Christ lag in Todes Banden.[33] Bach's application was accepted a month later, and he took up the post in July.[31] The position included significantly higher remuneration, improved conditions, and a better choir. Four months after arriving at Mühlhausen, Bach married Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin. Bach convinced the church and town government at Mühlhausen to fund an expensive renovation of the organ at the Blasius Church. In 1708, Bach wrote Gott ist mein König, a festive cantata for the inauguration of the new council, which was published at the council's expense.[22]\n\nBach left Mühlhausen in 1708, returning to Weimar this time as organist and from 1714 Konzertmeister (director of music) at the ducal court, where he could work with a large, well-funded contingent of professional musicians.[22] Bach and his wife moved into a house near the ducal palace.[34] Later that year, their first child, Catharina Dorothea, was born, and Maria Barbara's elder, unmarried sister joined them. She remained to help run the household until she died in 1729. Three sons were also born in Weimar: Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, and Johann Gottfried Bernhard. Johann Sebastian and Maria Barbara had three more children—twins born in 1713 and a single birth; none survived past their first birthday.\n\nBach's time in Weimar began a sustained period of composing keyboard and orchestral works. He attained the proficiency and confidence to extend the prevailing structures and include influences from abroad. He learned to write dramatic openings and employ the dynamic rhythms and harmonic schemes found in the music of Italians such as Vivaldi, Corelli, and Torelli. Bach absorbed these stylistic aspects to a certain extent by transcribing Vivaldi's string and wind concertos for harpsichord and organ; many of these transcribed works are still regularly performed. Bach was particularly attracted to the Italian style, in which one or more solo instruments alternate section-by-section with the full orchestra throughout a movement.[36]\n\nIn Weimar, Bach continued to play and compose for the organ and perform concert music with the duke's ensemble.[22] He also began to write the preludes and fugues that were later assembled into his monumental work The Well-Tempered Clavier (\"clavier\" meaning clavichord or harpsichord), consisting of two books, each containing 24 preludes and fugues in every major and minor key. In Weimar Bach also started work on the Little Organ Book, containing traditional Lutheran chorale tunes set in complex textures. In 1713, Bach was offered a post in Halle when he advised the authorities during a renovation by Christoph Cuntzius of the main organ in the west gallery of the Market Church of Our Dear Lady.[39][40]\n\nIn the spring of 1714, Bach was promoted to Konzertmeister, an honour that entailed performing a church cantata monthly in the castle church. The first three cantatas in the new series Bach composed in Weimar were Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, for Palm Sunday, which coincided with the Annunciation that year; Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12, for Jubilate Sunday; and Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten! BWV 172 for Pentecost.[42] Bach's first Christmas cantata, Christen, ätzet diesen Tag, BWV 63, premiered in 1714 or 1715.[43][44]\n\nIn 1717, Bach fell out of favour in Weimar and, according to a translation of the court secretary's report, was jailed for almost a month before being unfavorably dismissed: \"On November 6, [1717,] the quondam [former] concertmaster and organist Bach was confined to the County Judge's place of detention for too stubbornly forcing the issue of his dismissal and finally on December 2 was freed from arrest with notice of his unfavorable discharge.\"\n\nLeopold, Prince of Anhalt-Köthen, hired Bach to serve as his Kapellmeister (director of music) in 1717. Himself a musician, Leopold appreciated Bach's talents, paid him well, and gave him considerable latitude in composing and performing. Leopold was a Calvinist and did not use elaborate music in his worship; accordingly, most of Bach's work from this period is secular, including the orchestral suites, cello suites, sonatas and partitas for solo violin, and the Brandenburg Concertos. Bach also composed secular cantatas for the court, such as Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV 134a.\n\nDespite being born in the same year and only about 130 kilometres (80 mi) apart, Bach and Handel never met. In 1719, Bach made the 35-kilometre (22 mi) journey from Köthen to Halle with the intention to meet Handel, but Handel had left town. In 1730, Bach's oldest son, Wilhelm Friedemann, travelled to Halle to invite Handel to visit the Bach family in Leipzig, but the visit did not take place.\n\nOn 7 July 1720, while Bach was away in Carlsbad with Leopold, his wife, Maria Barbara Bach, suddenly died. The next year, he met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a young, gifted soprano 16 years his junior, who performed at the court in Köthen; they married on 3 December 1721. Together they had 13 children, six of whom survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726–1781); Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian, who both, especially Johann Christian, became significant musicians; Johanna Carolina (1737–1781); and Regina Susanna (1742–1809).\n\nIn 1723, Bach was appointed Thomaskantor director of church music in Leipzig. He had to direct the St. Thomas School and provide four churches with music, the St. Thomas Church, the St. Nicholas Church, and to a lesser extent, the New Church and St. Peter's Church. This was \"the leading cantorate in Protestant Germany\",[55] located in the mercantile city in the Electorate of Saxony, which he held for 27 years, until his death. During that time he gained further prestige through honorary appointments at the courts of Köthen and Weissenfels, as well as that of the Elector Frederick Augustus (who was also King of Poland) in Dresden.[55] Bach frequently disagreed with his employer, Leipzig's city council, which he regarded as \"penny-pinching\".\n\nJohann Kuhnau had been Thomaskantor in Leipzig from 1701 until his death on 5 June 1722. Bach had visited Leipzig during Kuhnau's tenure: in 1714, he attended the service at the St. Thomas Church on the first Sunday of Advent, and in 1717 he had tested the organ of the St. Paul's Church. In 1716, Bach and Kuhnau met on the occasion of the testing and inauguration of an organ in Halle.[40]\n\nThe position was offered to Bach only after it had been offered to Georg Philipp Telemann and then to Christoph Graupner, both of whom chose to stay where they were—Telemann in Hamburg and Graupner in Darmstadt—after using the Leipzig offer to negotiate better terms of employment.[59]\n\nBach was required to instruct the Thomasschule students in singing and provide church music for the main churches in Leipzig. He was also assigned to teach Latin but was allowed to employ four \"prefects\" (deputies) to do this instead. The prefects also aided with musical instruction. A cantata was required for the church services on Sundays and additional church holidays during the liturgical year.\n\nBach usually led performances of his cantatas, most composed within three years of his relocation to Leipzig. He assumed the office of Thomaskantor on 30 May 1723, presenting the first new cantata, Die Elenden sollen essen, BWV 75, in the St. Nicholas Church on the first Sunday after Trinity. Bach collected his cantatas in annual cycles. Five are mentioned in obituaries, and three are extant.[42] Of the more than 300 cantatas he composed in Leipzig, over 100 have been lost to posterity.[63] Most of these works expound on the Gospel readings prescribed for every Sunday and feast day in the Lutheran year. Bach started a second annual cycle on the first Sunday after the Trinity of 1724 and composed only chorale cantatas, each based on a single church hymn. These include O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 20, Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140, Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 62, and Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1.\n\nBach drew the soprano and alto choristers from the school and the tenors and basses from the school and elsewhere in Leipzig. Performing at weddings and funerals provided extra income for these groups; probably for this purpose, and for in-school training, he wrote at least six motets.[64] As part of his regular church work, he performed other composers' motets, which served as formal models for his own.[65]\n\nBach's predecessor as cantor, Johann Kuhnau, had also been music director for the St. Paul's Church, the church of Leipzig University. But when Bach was installed as cantor in 1723, he was put in charge only of music for festal (church holiday) services at St. Paul's Church; his petition to also provide music for regular Sunday services there (for a corresponding salary increase) went all the way to the Elector but was denied. In 1725, Bach \"lost interest\" in working even for festal services at St. Paul's Church and decided to appear there only on \"special occasions\". The St. Paul's Church had a much better and newer (1716) organ than the St. Thomas Church or the St. Nicholas Church. Bach was not required to play any organ in his official duties, but it is believed he liked to play on the St. Paul's Church organ for his own pleasure.\n\nBach broadened his composing and performing beyond the liturgy by taking over, in March 1729, the directorship of the Collegium Musicum, a secular performance ensemble Telemann started. This was one of the dozens of private societies in the major German-speaking cities established by musically active university students; they had become increasingly important in public musical life and were typically led by the most prominent professionals in a city. In the words of Christoph Wolff, assuming the directorship was a shrewd move that \"consolidated Bach's firm grip on Leipzig's principal musical institutions\". Every week, the Collegium Musicum gave two-hour performances, in winter at the Café Zimmermann, a coffeehouse on Catherine Street off the main market square, and in summer in the proprietor's outdoor coffee garden just outside the town walls, near the East Gate. The concerts, all free of charge, ended with Gottfried Zimmermann's death in 1741. Apart from showcasing his earlier orchestral repertoire, such as the Brandenburg Concertos and orchestral suites, many of Bach's newly composed or reworked pieces were performed for these venues, including parts of his Clavier-Übung (Keyboard Practice), his violin and keyboard concertos, and the Coffee Cantata.[22][70]\n\nIn 1733, Bach composed a Kyrie–Gloria Mass in B minor that he later incorporated in his Mass in B minor. He presented the manuscript to the Elector in a successful bid to persuade the prince to give him the title of Court Composer.[71] He later extended this work into a full mass by adding a Credo, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei, the music for which was partly based on his own cantatas and partly original. Bach's appointment as Court Composer was an element of his long-term struggle to achieve greater bargaining power with the Leipzig council. Between 1737 and 1739, Bach's former pupil Carl Gotthelf Gerlach held the directorship of the Collegium Musicum.\n\nIn 1735, Bach started preparing his first organ music publication, which was printed as the third Clavier-Übung in 1739.[72] From around that year he started to compile and compose the set of preludes and fugues for harpsichord that became the second book of The Well-Tempered Clavier.[73] He received the title of \"Royal Court Composer\" from Augustus III in 1736.[71]\n\nFrom 1740 to 1748 Bach copied, transcribed, expanded or programmed music in an older polyphonic style (stile antico) by, among others, Palestrina (BNB I/P/2),[74] Kerll (BWV 241),[75] Torri (BWV Anh. 30),[76] Bassani (BWV 1081),[77] Gasparini (Missa Canonica),[78] and Caldara (BWV 1082).[79] Bach's style shifted in the last decade of his life, showing an increased integration of polyphonic structures and canons and other elements of the stile antico.[80] His fourth and last Clavier-Übung volume, the Goldberg Variations for two-manual harpsichord, contained nine canons and was published in 1741.[81] During this period, Bach also continued to adapt music of contemporaries such as Handel (BNB I/K/2)[82] and Stölzel (BWV 200),[83] and gave many of his own earlier compositions, such as the St Matthew and St John Passions and the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes,[84] their final revisions. He also programmed and adapted music by composers of a younger generation, including Pergolesi (BWV 1083),[85] and his own students, such as Goldberg (BNB I/G/2).[86]\n\nIn 1746 Bach was preparing to enter Lorenz Christoph Mizler's Society of Musical Sciences [de].[87] To be admitted, he had to submit a composition. He chose his Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\", and a portrait painted by Elias Gottlob Haussmann that featured Bach's Canon triplex á 6 Voc.[88] In May 1747, Bach visited the court of King Frederick II of Prussia in Potsdam. The king played a theme for Bach and challenged him to improvise a fugue based on it. Bach obliged, playing a three-part fugue on one of Frederick's fortepianos, a new type of instrument at the time. Upon his return to Leipzig he composed a set of fugues and canons and a trio sonata based on the Thema Regium (\"king's theme\"). Within a few weeks this music was published as The Musical Offering and dedicated to Frederick. The Schübler Chorales, a set of six chorale preludes transcribed from cantata movements Bach had written two decades earlier, were published within a year.[90][91] Around the same time, the set of five canonic variations Bach had submitted when entering Mizler's society in 1747 were also printed.[92]\n\nTwo large-scale compositions occupied a central place in Bach's last years. Beginning around 1742, he wrote and revised the various canons and fugues of The Art of Fugue, which he continued to prepare for publication until shortly before his death.[93] After extracting a cantata, BWV 191 from his 1733 Kyrie-Gloria Mass for the Dresden court in the mid-1740s, Bach expanded that setting into his Mass in B minor in the last years of his life. The complete mass was not performed during his lifetime. It is considered among the greatest choral works in history.[95]\n\nIn January 1749, Bach's daughter Elisabeth Juliane Friederica married his pupil Johann Christoph Altnickol. Bach's health was declining. On 2 June, Heinrich von Brühl wrote to one of the Leipzig burgomasters to request that his music director, Gottlob Harrer, fill the Thomaskantor and Director musices posts \"upon the eventual ... decease of Mr. Bach\".[96] Becoming blind, Bach underwent eye surgery in March 1750 and again in April by the British eye surgeon John Taylor, a man widely understood today as a charlatan and believed to have blinded hundreds of people.[97] Bach died on 28 July 1750 from complications due to the unsuccessful treatment.[98]\n\nAn inventory drawn up a few months after Bach's death shows that his estate included five harpsichords, two lute-harpsichords, three violins, three violas, two cellos, a viola da gamba, a lute, a spinet, and 52 \"sacred books\", including works by Martin Luther and Josephus. C.P.E. Bach saw to it that The Art of Fugue, though unfinished, was published in 1751.[102] Together with one of J.S. Bach's former students, Johann Friedrich Agricola, C.P.E. Bach also wrote the obituary (\"Nekrolog\"), which was published in Mizler's Musikalische Bibliothek [de], a periodical journal produced by the Society of Musical Sciences, in 1754.[92]\n\nFrom an early age, Bach studied the works of his musical contemporaries of the Baroque period and those of earlier generations, and those influences are reflected in his music. Like his contemporaries Handel, Telemann, and Vivaldi, Bach composed concertos, suites, recitatives, da capo arias, and four-part choral music, and employed basso continuo. His music is harmonically more innovative than his peers', employing surprisingly dissonant chords and progressions, often extensively exploring harmonic possibilities within one piece.[104]\n\nBach's hundreds of sacred works are usually seen as manifesting not just his craft but also a deep faith in God.[106] He had taught Luther's Small Catechism as the Thomaskantor in Leipzig, and some of his pieces represent it. The Lutheran chorale was the basis of much of his work. In elaborating these hymns into his chorale preludes, he wrote more cogent and tightly integrated works than most, even when they were massive and lengthy.[citation needed] The large-scale structure of every major Bach sacred vocal work is evidence of subtle, elaborate planning to create religiously and musically powerful expression. For example, the St Matthew Passion, like other works of its kind, illustrated the Passion with Bible text reflected in recitatives, arias, choruses, and chorales, but in crafting this work, Bach created an overall experience that has been found over the intervening centuries to be both musically thrilling and spiritually profound.[108]\n\nBach published or carefully compiled in manuscript many collections of pieces that explored the range of artistic and technical possibilities inherent in almost every genre of his time except opera. For example, The Well-Tempered Clavier comprises two books, each of which presents a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key, displaying a dizzying variety of structural, contrapuntal and fugal techniques.[109]\n\nFour-part harmony predates Bach, but he lived during a time when modal music in Western tradition was largely supplanted by the tonal system. In this system a piece of music progresses from one chord to the next according to certain rules, with each chord characterised by four notes. The principles of four-part harmony are found not only in Bach's four-part choral music; he also prescribes it for instance in figured bass accompaniment. The new system was at the core of Bach's style, and his compositions are to a large extent considered to have laid down the rules for the evolving scheme that dominated musical expression in the next centuries. Some examples of this characteristic of Bach's style and its influence:\n• When in the 1740s Bach staged his arrangement of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater, he upgraded the viola part (which in the original composition plays in unison with the bass part) to fill in the harmony, thus adapting the composition to four-part harmony. 111\n• When, starting in the 19th century in Russia, there was a discussion about the authenticity of four-part court chant settings compared to earlier Russian traditions, Bach's four-part chorale settings, such as those ending his Chorale cantatas, were considered foreign-influenced models, but such influence was deemed unavoidable. 112\n\nBach's insistence on the tonal system and contribution to shaping it did not imply he was less at ease with the older modal system and the genres associated with it: more than his contemporaries (who had \"moved on\" to the tonal system without much exception), Bach often returned to the then-antiquated modes and genres. His Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue, emulating the chromatic fantasia genre used by earlier composers such as Dowland and Sweelinck in D dorian mode (comparable to D minor in the tonal system), is an example.\n\nModulation, or changing key in the course of a piece, is another style characteristic where Bach goes beyond the norm in his time. Baroque instruments vastly limited modulation possibilities: keyboard instruments, before a workable system of temperament, limited the keys that could be modulated to, and wind instruments, especially brass instruments such as trumpets and horns, about a century before they were fitted with valves, were tied to the key of their tuning. Bach pushed the limits: he added \"strange tones\" in his organ playing, confusing the singers, according to an indictment he had to face in Arnstadt, and Louis Marchand, another early experimenter with modulation, seems to have avoided confrontation with Bach because the latter went further than anyone had done before. In the \"Suscepit Israel\" of his 1723 Magnificat, he had the trumpets in E-flat play a melody in the enharmonic scale of C minor.[115]\n\nThe major development in Bach's time to which he contributed in no small way was a temperament for keyboard instruments that allowed their use in every key (12 major and 12 minor) and also modulation without retuning. His Capriccio on the departure of a beloved brother, a very early work, showed a gusto for modulation unlike any contemporary work it has been compared to, but the full expansion came with the Well-Tempered Clavier, using all keys, which Bach apparently had been developing since around 1720, the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach being one of its earliest examples.[117]\n\nThe second page of the Klavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedemann Bach is an ornament notation and performance guide that Bach wrote for his eldest son when he was nine years old. Bach was generally quite specific on ornamentation in his compositions (in his time, much ornamentation was not written out by composers but rather considered a liberty of the performer), and his ornamentation was often quite elaborate. For instance, the \"Aria\" of the Goldberg Variations has rich ornamentation in nearly every measure. Bach's approach to ornamentation can also be seen in a keyboard arrangement he made of Marcello's Oboe Concerto: he added explicit ornamentation, which centuries later is still played.[119]\n\nAlthough Bach wrote no operas, he was not averse to the genre or its ornamented vocal style. In church music, Italian composers had imitated the operatic vocal style in genres such as the Neapolitan mass. In Protestant surroundings, there was more reluctance to adopt such a style for liturgical music. Kuhnau had notoriously shunned opera and Italian virtuoso vocal music.[120] Bach was less moved. After a performance of his St Matthew Passion, someone said it all sounded much like opera.\n\nIn concerted playing in Bach's time, the basso continuo, consisting of instruments such as organ, viola da gamba, or harpsichord, usually had the role of accompaniment, providing a piece's harmonic and rhythmic foundation. Beginning in the 1720s, Bach had the organ play concertante (i.e., as a soloist) with the orchestra in instrumental cantata movements,[122] a decade before Handel published his first organ concertos.[123] Apart from the 5th Brandenburg Concerto and the Triple Concerto, which already had harpsichord soloists in the 1720s, Bach wrote and arranged his harpsichord concertos in the 1730s,[124] and in his sonatas for viola da gamba and harpsichord neither instrument plays a continuo part: they are treated as equal soloists, far beyond the figured bass. In this way, Bach played a key role in the development of genres such as the keyboard concerto.\n\nBach wrote virtuoso music for specific instruments as well as music independent of instrumentation. For instance, the sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle of what has been written for violin, within reach of only accomplished players. The music fits the instrument, using the full gamut of its possibilities and requiring virtuosity but without bravura.[126] Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable, Bach transcribed some pieces in this collection for other instruments. Similarly, the virtuoso cello suites seem tailored to the instrument, the best of what is offered for it, but Bach arranged one of the suites for lute. The same applies to much of his most virtuoso keyboard music. Bach exploited an instrument's capacities to the fullest while keeping the core of the music independent of the instrument on which it is performed.\n\nIn this sense, it is no surprise that Bach's music is easily and often performed on instruments it was not written for, that it is transcribed so often, and that his melodies turn up in unexpected places, such as jazz music. Apart from this, Bach left several compositions without specified instrumentation: the canons BWV 1072–1078 are in that category, as is the bulk of the Musical Offering and the Art of Fugue.[127]\n\nAnother characteristic of Bach's style is his extensive use of counterpoint, as opposed to the homophony used in his four-part chorale settings, for example. Bach's canons, and especially his fugues, are the most characteristic of this style, which he did not invent but contributed to so fundamentally that to a large extent he defined it. Fugues are as characteristic of Bach's style as, for instance, sonata form is of the composers of the Classical period.\n\nThese strictly contrapuntal compositions, and most of Bach's music in general, are characterised by distinct melodic lines for each voice, where the chords formed by the notes sounding at a given point follow the rules of four-part harmony. Johann Nikolaus Forkel, Bach's first biographer, gives this description of this feature of Bach's music, which sets it apart from most other music:\n\nBach devoted more attention than his contemporaries to his compositions' structure. This can be seen in minor adjustments he made when adapting someone else's work, such as his earliest version of the \"Keiser\" St Mark Passion, where he enhances scene transitions,[130] and in the architecture of his own work, such as his Magnificat[115] and Leipzig Passions. In his last years, Bach revised several of his compositions. Often, recasting such previously composed music in an enhanced structure was the most salient change, as in the Mass in B minor. Bach's known preoccupation with structure led (peaking around the 1970s) to various numerological analyses of his compositions, although many of these were later rejected, especially those that wandered into symbolism-ridden hermeneutics.[131][132]\n\nThe librettos, or lyrics, of his vocal compositions played an essential role for Bach. He sought collaboration with various text authors for his cantatas and major vocal compositions, possibly writing or adapting such texts himself to make them fit the structure of the composition when he could not rely on the talents of other text authors. His collaboration with Picander for the St Matthew Passion libretto is best known, but there was a similar process in achieving a multi-layered structure for his St John Passion libretto a few years earlier.[133]\n\nIn 1950, Wolfgang Schmieder published a thematic catalogue of Bach's compositions called the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (Bach Works Catalogue).[134] Schmieder largely followed the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe, a comprehensive edition of the composer's works that was produced between 1850 and 1900. The first edition of the catalogue listed 1,080 surviving compositions indisputably composed by Bach.[135]\n\nBWV 1081–1126 were added to the catalogue in the second half of the 20th century, and BWV 1127 and higher are 21st-century additions.[136][137][138]\n\nBach composed Passions for Good Friday services and oratorios such as the Christmas Oratorio, which is a set of six cantatas for use in the liturgical season of Christmas.[141] Shorter oratorios include the Easter Oratorio and the Ascension Oratorio. With its double choir and orchestra, the St Matthew Passion is one of Bach's most extended works. The St John Passion was the first passion Bach composed during his tenure as Thomaskantor in Leipzig.\n\nAccording to his obituary, Bach would have composed five year-cycles of sacred cantatas and additional church cantatas for weddings and funerals.[92] Approximately 200 of these sacred works are extant, an estimated two-thirds of the total number of church cantatas he composed.[63][142] The Bach Digital website lists 50 known secular cantatas by the composer,[143] about half of which are extant or largely reconstructable.[144]\n\nBach's cantatas vary greatly in form and instrumentation. Many consist of a large opening chorus followed by one or more recitative-aria pairs for soloists (or duets) and a concluding chorale. The melody of the concluding chorale often appears as a cantus firmus in the opening movement.[145]\n\nBach's earliest cantatas date from his years in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen. The earliest surviving work in the genre is Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150. Overall, the extant early works show remarkable mastery and skill. Many feature an instrumental opening which displays effective use of the limited instrumental forces available to Bach, whether it be in the subdued combination of two recorders and two violas de gamba for BWV 106, or the independent bassoon in BWV 196. Bach's compositional skills also manifest through his daring harmonies and advanced, unprecedented chord progressions. According to Christoph Wolff, Bach's early cantatas are impressive evidence of how the modest means at his disposal did not restrain the composer in the slightest, and they compare favourably with compositions by the most talented composers from the beginning of the 18th century, such as Krieger, Kuhnau or Zachow.\n\nAfter taking up his office as Thomaskantor in late May 1723, Bach performed a cantata each Sunday and feast day, corresponding to the lectionary readings of the week.[22] His first cantata cycle ran from the first Sunday after Trinity of 1723 to Trinity Sunday the next year. For instance, the Visitation cantata Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147, containing the chorale that is known in English as \"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\", belongs to this first cycle. The cantata cycle of his second year in Leipzig is called the chorale cantata cycle as it consists mainly of works in the chorale cantata format. His third cantata cycle was developed over several years, followed by the Picander cycle of 1728–29.\n\nLater church cantatas include the chorale cantatas Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott, BWV 80 (final version)[147] and Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140.[148] Only the first three Leipzig cycles are more or less completely extant. Apart from his own work, Bach also performed cantatas by Telemann and by his distant relative Johann Ludwig Bach.[22]\n\nBach also wrote secular cantatas, for instance for members of the royal Polish and prince-electoral Saxonian families (e.g. Trauer-Ode),[149] or other public or private occasions (e.g. Hunting Cantata).[150] The text of these cantatas was occasionally in dialect (e.g. Peasant Cantata)[151] or Italian (e.g. Amore traditore).[152] Many of the secular cantatas were lost, but for some of them, the text and occasion are known. For instance, when Picander later published their librettos (e.g. BWV Anh. 11–12).[153]\n\nSome of the surviving secular cantatas have a plot involving mythological figures of Greek antiquity (e.g. Der Streit zwischen Phoebus und Pan),[154] and others were almost miniature buffo operas (e.g. Coffee Cantata).[155] Although Bach never expressed any interest in opera,[156] his secular cantatas, or drammi per musica, would have allowed Leipzig audiences, deprived of opera since 1720, to experience musical performances comparable to the royal opera in Dresden. These were not \"poor or makeshift substitutes for real opera\" but spectacles displaying \"full mastery of the dramatic genre and the proper pacing of the dialogues.\"\n\nBach's motets (BWV 225–231) are pieces on sacred themes for choir and continuo, with instruments playing colla parte. Several of them were composed for funerals.[158] The six motets definitely composed by Bach are Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, Jesu, meine Freude, Fürchte dich nicht, Komm, Jesu, komm, and Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden. The motet Sei Lob und Preis mit Ehren (BWV 231) is part of the composite motet Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt (BWV Anh. 160), other parts of which may be based on work by Telemann.[159]\n\nBach's church music in Latin includes the Magnificat, four Kyrie–Gloria Masses, and the Mass in B minor.\n\nThe first version of Bach's Magnificat dates from 1723, but the work is best known in its D major version of 1733.\n\nIn 1733, Bach composed a Kyrie–Gloria Mass for the Dresden court. Near the end of his life, around 1748–1749, he expanded this composition into the large-scale Mass in B minor. The work was never performed in full during Bach's lifetime.[160]\n\nBach wrote for organ and for stringed keyboard instruments such as harpsichord, clavichord and lute-harpsichord.\n\nBach was best known during his lifetime as an organist, organ consultant, and composer of organ works in both the traditional German free genres (such as preludes, fantasias, and toccatas) and stricter forms (such as chorale preludes and fugues).[22] At a young age, he established a reputation for creativity and the ability to integrate foreign styles into his organ works. A decidedly North German influence was exerted by Georg Böhm, with whom Bach came into contact in Lüneburg, and Dieterich Buxtehude, whom the young organist visited in Lübeck in 1704 on an extended leave of absence from his job in Arnstadt. Around this time, Bach copied the works of numerous French and Italian composers to gain insights into their compositional languages and later arranged violin concertos by Vivaldi and others for organ and harpsichord. During his most productive period (1708–1714), he composed about a dozen pairs of preludes and fugues, five toccatas and fugues, and the Orgelbüchlein or \"Little Organ Book\", an unfinished collection of 46 short chorale preludes that demonstrate compositional techniques in the setting of chorale tunes. After leaving Weimar, Bach wrote less for organ, although some of his best-known works (the six Organ Sonatas, the German Organ Mass in Clavier-Übung III from 1739, and the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes, revised late in his life) were composed after leaving Weimar. Later in his life, Bach extensively consulted on organ projects, tested new organs, and dedicated playing organs to afternoon recitals.[162][163] The Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\" and the Schübler Chorales are organ works Bach published in the last years of his life.\n\nBach wrote many works for harpsichord, some of which may also have been played on the clavichord or lute-harpsichord. Some of his more significant works, such as Clavier-Übung II and IV, are intended for a harpsichord with two manuals: performing them on a keyboard instrument with a single manual (like a piano) may present technical difficulties for the crossing of hands.\n• The Well-Tempered Clavier, Books 1 and 2 (BWV 846–893). Each book consists of a prelude and fugue in each of the 24 major and minor keys, in chromatic order from C major to B minor (thus, the whole collection is often referred to as \"the 48\"). \"Well-tempered\" in the title refers to the temperament (system of tuning); many temperaments before Bach's time were not flexible enough to allow compositions to utilise more than just a few keys. 165\n• The Inventions and Sinfonias (BWV 772–801). These short two- and three-part contrapuntal works are arranged in the same chromatic order as The Well-Tempered Clavier, omitting certain rarer keys. Bach intended these pieces for instructional purposes. 166\n• Three collections of dance suites: the English Suites (BWV 806–811), French Suites (BWV 812–817), and Partitas for keyboard ( , BWV 825–830). Each collection contains six suites built on the standard model ( – – –(optional movement)– ). The English Suites closely follow the traditional model, adding a prelude before the and including a single movement between the and . 167 The French Suites omit preludes but have multiple movements between the and . 168 The partitas expand the model further with elaborate introductory movements and miscellaneous movements between the basic elements of the model. 169\n• The Goldberg Variations (BWV 988), an aria with 30 variations. The collection has a complex and unconventional structure: the variations build on the bass line of the aria rather than its melody, and musical canons are interpolated according to a grand plan. There are nine canons within the 30 variations; every third variation is a canon. 170 These variations move in order from canon at unison to canon at the ninth. The first eight are in pairs (unison and octave, second and seventh, third and sixth, fourth and fifth). The ninth canon stands on its own due to compositional dissimilarities. The final variation, instead of being the expected canon at the tenth, is a quodlibet.\n• Miscellaneous pieces such as the Overture in the French Style (French Overture, BWV 831) and the Italian Concerto (BWV 971) (published together as ), and the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue (BWV 903).\n\nAmong Bach's lesser known keyboard works are seven toccatas (BWV 910–916), four duets (BWV 802–805), sonatas for keyboard (BWV 963–967), the Six Little Preludes (BWV 933–938), and the Aria variata alla maniera italiana (BWV 989).\n\nBach wrote for single instruments, duets, and small ensembles. Many of his solo works, such as the six sonatas and partitas for violin (BWV 1001–1006) and the six cello suites (BWV 1007–1012), are widely considered to be among the most profound in the repertoire.[171][126] He wrote sonatas for a solo instrument such as the viola de gamba accompanied by harpsichord or continuo, as well as trio sonatas (two instruments and continuo).\n\nThe Musical Offering and The Art of Fugue are late contrapuntal works containing pieces for unspecified or combinations of instruments.[173]\n\nSurviving works in the concerto form include two violin concertos (BWV 1041 in A minor and BWV 1042 in E major) and a concerto for two violins in D minor, BWV 1043, often referred to as Bach's \"double concerto\".\n\nBach's best-known orchestral works are the Brandenburg Concertos, so named because he submitted them in the hope of gaining employment from Margrave Christian Ludwig of Brandenburg-Schwedt in 1721; his application was unsuccessful.[22] These works are examples of the concerto grosso genre.\n\nBach composed and transcribed concertos for one to four harpsichords. Many of the harpsichord concertos were not original works, but arrangements of his concertos for other instruments are now lost.[174] Several violin, oboe, and flute concertos have been reconstructed from these.\n\nIn addition to concertos, Bach wrote four orchestral suites, each suite being a series of stylised dances for orchestra, preceded by a French overture.[175]\n\nIn his early youth, Bach copied pieces by other composers to learn from them. Later, he copied and arranged music for performance or as study material for his pupils. Some of these pieces, like \"Bist du bei mir\" (copied not by Bach but by Anna Magdalena), became famous before being dissociated with Bach. Bach copied and arranged Italian masters such as Vivaldi (e.g. BWV 1065), Pergolesi (BWV 1083) and Palestrina (Missa Sine nomine), French masters such as François Couperin (BWV Anh. 183), and, closer to home, various German masters including Telemann (e.g. BWV 824=TWV 32:14) and Handel (arias from Brockes Passion), and music from members of his own family. He also often copied and arranged his own music (e.g. movements from cantatas for his short masses BWV 233–236), as his music was likewise copied and arranged by others. Some of these arrangements, like the late 19th-century \"Air on the G String\", helped to popularise Bach's music.\n\nSometimes, \"who copied whom\" is not clear. For instance, Forkel mentions a Mass for double chorus among the works composed by Bach. The work was published and performed in the early 19th century. Although a score partially in Bach's handwriting exists, the work was later considered spurious. In 1950, the design of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis was to keep such works out of the main catalogue: if there was a strong association with Bach they could be listed in its appendix (German: Anhang, abbreviated as Anh.). Thus, for instance, the aforementioned Mass for double chorus became BWV Anh. 167. But this was far from the end of the attribution issues. For instance, Schlage doch, gewünschte Stunde, BWV 53, was later attributed to Melchior Hoffmann. For other works, Bach's authorship was put in doubt without a generally accepted answer to the question of whether or not he composed it: the best-known organ composition in the BWV catalogue, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, was indicated as one of these uncertain works in the late 20th century.[178]\n\nIn the 18th century, Bach's music was appreciated mostly by distinguished connoisseurs. The 19th century started with the publication of the first biography of Bach and ended with the Bach Gesellschaft's completion and publication of all his known works. Starting with the Bach Revival, he began to be regarded as one of the greatest composers, a reputation he has maintained. The BACH motif, which Bach occasionally used in his compositions, has been used in dozens of tributes to him since the 19th century.\n\nIn his own time, Bach was highly regarded by his colleagues, but his reputation outside this small circle of connoisseurs was due not to his compositions (which had an extremely narrow circulation), but to his virtuosic abilities. Nevertheless, during his life, Bach received public recognition, such as the title of court composer by Augustus III of Poland and the appreciation he was shown by Frederick the Great and Hermann Karl von Keyserling. This appreciation contrasted with the humiliations he faced, for instance, in Leipzig.[180] Bach also had detractors in the contemporary press (Johann Adolf Scheibe suggested he write less complex music) and supporters, such as Johann Mattheson and Lorenz Christoph Mizler.[181][182][183]\n\nAfter his death, Bach's reputation as a composer initially declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style.[184] He was remembered more as a virtuoso organ player and a teacher. The bulk of the music printed during his lifetime, at least the remembered parts, was for organ or harpsichord. Thus his reputation as a composer was initially mostly limited to his keyboard music, which was relatively limited in its value to music education.\n\nBach's surviving family members, who inherited many of his manuscripts, were not all equally concerned with preserving them, leading to considerable losses. Carl Philipp Emanuel, his second-eldest son, was most active in safeguarding his father's legacy: he co-authored his father's obituary, contributed to the publication of his four-part chorales, staged some of his works, and helped preserve the bulk of his previously unpublished work.[187] Wilhelm Friedemann, the eldest son, performed several of his father's cantatas in Halle, but after becoming unemployed sold part of the large collection of his father's works he owned.[188] Several students of the old master, such as his son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol, Johann Friedrich Agricola, Johann Kirnberger, and Johann Ludwig Krebs, contributed to the dissemination of his legacy. The early devotees were not all musicians; for example, in Berlin, Daniel Itzig, a high official of Frederick the Great's court, venerated Bach.[191] His eldest daughters took lessons from Kirnberger and their sister Sara from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, who was in Berlin from 1774 to 1784.[191][192] Sara Itzig Levy became an avid collector of work by J.S. Bach and his sons and was a \"patron\" of C.P.E. Bach.[192]\n\nWhile Bach was in Leipzig, performances of his church music were limited to some of his motets, and, under cantor Doles, some of his Passions. A new generation of Bach aficionados emerged who studiously collected and copied his music, including some of his large-scale works such as the Mass in B minor, and performed it privately. One was Gottfried van Swieten, a high-ranking Austrian official who was instrumental in passing Bach's legacy on to the composers of the Viennese school. Haydn owned manuscript copies of The Well-Tempered Clavier and the Mass in B minor and was influenced by Bach's music. Mozart owned a copy of one of Bach's motets,[194] transcribed some of his instrumental works (K. 404a, 405),[195][196] and wrote contrapuntal music influenced by his style.[197][198] Beethoven played the entire Well-Tempered Clavier by the time he was 11 and described Bach as Urvater der Harmonie (progenitor of harmony).[199][200][201][203]\n\nIn 1802, Johann Nikolaus Forkel published Johann Sebastian Bach: His Life, Art, and Work, the first Bach biography, dedicated to van Swieten. In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had come down from C.P.E. Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie.[191] The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance, his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano.[191]\n\nThe first decades of the 19th century saw an increasing number of first publications of Bach's music: Breitkopf started publishing chorale preludes, Hoffmeister harpsichord music, and the Well-Tempered Clavier was printed concurrently by Simrock (Germany), Nägeli (Switzerland) and Hoffmeister (Germany and Austria) in 1801. Vocal music was also published: motets in 1802 and 1803, followed by the E♭ major version of the Magnificat, the Kyrie-Gloria Mass in A major, and the cantata Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott (BWV 80). In 1818, Hans Georg Nägeli called the Mass in B minor the greatest composition ever.[199] Bach's influence was felt in the next generation of early Romantic composers.[200] Abraham's son Felix, aged 13, produced his first Magnificat setting in 1822, and it is clearly inspired by the then-unpublished D major version of Bach's Magnificat.[209]\n\nFelix Mendelssohn's 1829 performance of the St Matthew Passion precipitated the Bach Revival. The St John Passion saw its 19th-century premiere in 1833, and the first public performance of the Mass in B minor followed in 1844. Besides these and other public performances and increased coverage of the composer and his compositions in printed media, the 1830s and 1840s also saw the first publication of more Bach vocal works: six cantatas, the St Matthew Passion, and the Mass in B minor. A series of organ compositions were first published in 1833.[210] Chopin started composing his 24 Preludes, Op. 28, inspired by the Well-Tempered Clavier, in 1835, and Schumann published his Sechs Fugen über den Namen B-A-C-H in 1845. Bach's music was transcribed and arranged to suit contemporary tastes and performance practice by composers such as Carl Friedrich Zelter, Robert Franz, and Franz Liszt, or combined with new music such as the melody line of Charles Gounod's \"Ave Maria\".[199] Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner were among the composers who promoted Bach's music or wrote glowingly about it.\n\nIn 1850, the Bach-Gesellschaft (Bach Society) was founded to promote Bach's music. In the second half of the 19th century, the Society published a comprehensive edition of his works. In 1854, Bach was deemed one of the three Bs by Peter Cornelius, the others being Beethoven and Berlioz. (Hans von Bülow replaced Berlioz with Brahms.) From 1873 to 1880, Philipp Spitta published Johann Sebastian Bach, the standard work on Bach's life and music.[212] During the 19th century, 200 books were published on Bach. By the end of the century, local Bach societies were established in several cities, and his music had been performed in all major musical centers.[199]\n\nIn 19th-century Germany, Bach was coupled with nationalist feeling, and he was inscribed in a religious revival. In England, Bach was coupled with a revival of religious and baroque music. By the end of the century, Bach was firmly established as one of the greatest composers, recognised for both his instrumental and his vocal music.[199]\n\nDuring the 20th century, the process of recognising the musical as well as the pedagogic value of some of the works continued, as in the promotion of the cello suites by Pablo Casals, the first major performer to record them.[213] Leading performers of classical music such as Willem Mengelberg, Edwin Fischer, Georges Enescu, Herbert von Karajan, Helmut Walcha, Wanda Landowska, I Musici, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau recorded his music.[n 3]\n\nA significant development in the later 20th century was historically informed performance practice, with forerunners such as Nikolaus Harnoncourt acquiring prominence through their performances of Bach's music. Bach's keyboard music was again performed on the harpsichord and other Baroque instruments rather than on modern pianos and 19th-century romantic organs. Ensembles playing and singing Bach's music not only kept to the instruments and the performance style of his day but were also reduced to the size of the groups Bach used for his performances.[214] But that was not the only way Bach's music came to the forefront in the 20th century: his music was heard in versions ranging from Ferruccio Busoni's late romantic piano transcriptions to the orchestrations of Leopold Stokowski, whose interpretation of the Toccata and Fugue in D minor opened Walt Disney's Fantasia, to jazzy interpretations such as those by The Swingle Singers on their album Jazz Sebastian Bach and electronic performances such as Wendy Carlos's Switched-On Bach and The Well-Tempered Synthesizer.\n\nBach's music has influenced other genres. Jazz musicians have adapted it, with Jacques Loussier, Ian Anderson, Uri Caine, and the Modern Jazz Quartet among those creating jazz versions of his works.[215] Several 20th-century composers referred to Bach or his music, for example Eugène Ysaÿe in Six Sonatas for solo violin, Dmitri Shostakovich in 24 Preludes and Fugues, and Heitor Villa-Lobos in Bachianas Brasileiras. All kinds of publications involved Bach: there were the Bach Jahrbuch publications of the Neue Bachgesellschaft and various other biographies and studies by, among others, Albert Schweitzer, Charles Sanford Terry, Alfred Dürr, Christoph Wolff. Peter Williams, and John Butt,[n 4] and the 1950 first edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis. Books such as Gödel, Escher, Bach put the composer's art in a wider perspective. Bach's music was extensively listened to, performed, broadcast, arranged, adapted, and commented upon in the 1990s.[216] Around 2000, the 250th anniversary of Bach's death, three record companies issued box sets of recordings of his complete works.[217][218][219]\n\nThree works by Bach are featured on the Voyager Golden Record, a gramophone record containing a broad sample of the images, sounds, languages, and music of Earth, sent into space with the two Voyager probes: the first movement of Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 (conducted by Karl Richter), the \"Gavotte en rondeaux\" from the Partita for Violin No. 3 (played by Arthur Grumiaux), and the Prelude and Fugue No. 1 in C major from The Well-Tempered Clavier (played by Glenn Gould).[220] 20th-century tributes to Bach include statues erected in his honour and things such as streets and space objects named after him.[221][222] A multitude of musical ensembles, such as the Bach Aria Group, Deutsche Bachsolisten, Bachchor Stuttgart, and Bach Collegium Japan took the composer's name. Bach festivals were held on several continents, and competitions and prizes such as the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition and the Royal Academy of Music Bach Prize were named after him. While by the end of the 19th century, Bach had been inscribed in nationalism and religious revival, the late 20th century saw Bach as the subject of a secularised art-as-religion (Kunstreligion).[199][216]\n\nIn the 21st century, Bach's compositions have become available online, for instance at the International Music Score Library Project.[223] High-resolution facsimiles of Bach's autographs became available at the Bach Digital website.[224] 21st-century biographers include Christoph Wolff, Peter Williams, and John Eliot Gardiner.[n 5]\n\nIn 2015, Bach's handwritten personal copy of the Mass in B minor, held by the Berlin State Library, was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World Register,[225] a program intended to protect culturally significant manuscripts.\n\nAlex Ross writes, \"Bach became an absolute master of his art by never ceasing to be a student of it. His most exalted sacred works—the two extant Passions, from the seventeen-twenties, and the Mass in B Minor, completed not long before his death in 1750—are feats of synthesis, mobilizing secular devices to spiritual ends. They are rooted in archaic chants, hymns, and chorales. They honor, with consummate skill, the scholastic discipline of canon and fugue. They make expert use of the word-painting techniques of the Renaissance madrigal and Baroque opera. They absorb such stock scenes as the lament, the pastoral, the lullaby, the rage aria, the tempest. They allude to courtly French dances, Italian love songs, [and] the polonaise. Their furious development of brief motifs anticipates Beethoven, who worshipped Bach when he was young. And their most daring harmonic adventures—for example, the otherworldly modulations in the 'Confiteor' of the B-Minor Mass—look ahead to Wagner, even to Schoenberg.\"[226]\n\nIn 2019, Bach was named the greatest composer of all time in a poll of 174 living composers.[227]\n\nThe liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church remembers Bach with a feast day on 28 July;[228] on the same day, the Calendar of Saints of some Lutheran churches, such as the ELCA, remembers Bach, Handel, and Heinrich Schütz.[229]\n\nBach was originally buried at Old St. John's Cemetery in Leipzig. His grave went unmarked for nearly 150 years, but in 1894 his remains were found and moved to a vault in St. John's Church. This building was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II, and in 1950, Bach's remains were taken to their present grave in St. Thomas Church.[22] Later research has called into question whether the remains in the grave are actually Bach's.[230]\n\nSee: Crist & Stauff 2011, for an extensive bibliography.\n• None Baron, Carol K.

Only 10 of them lived to adulthood. Several of his sons, including Wilhelm Friedemann , Carl Philipp Emanuel , and Johann Christian , who was called the “English Bach,” were also composers.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach was born into a musical family. Orphaned before he turned 10 years old, he was looked after by his eldest brother, an organist who gave him his first keyboard lessons. Bach did well at school, and he was selected for a choir of poor boys at the school in Michaelskirche, Lüneburg , Germany .\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach is regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time. He is celebrated as the creator of many masterpieces of church and instrumental music. His compositions represent the best of the Baroque era .\n\nUntil the birth of Johann Sebastian, his was the least distinguished branch of the family; some of its members, such as Johann Christoph and Johann Ludwig, had been competent practical musicians but not composers. In later days the most important musicians in the family were Johann Sebastian’s sons— Wilhelm Friedemann , Carl Philipp Emanuel , and Johann Christian (the “English Bach”).\n\nHe was a member of a remarkable family of musicians who were proud of their achievements, and about 1735 he drafted a genealogy, Ursprung der musicalisch-Bachischen Familie (“Origin of the Musical Bach Family”), in which he traced his ancestry back to his great-great-grandfather Veit Bach, a Lutheran baker (or miller) who late in the 16th century was driven from Hungary to Wechmar in Thuringia , a historic region of Germany , by religious persecution and died in 1619. There were Bachs in the area before then, and it may be that, when Veit moved to Wechmar, he was returning to his birthplace. He used to take his cittern to the mill and play it while the mill was grinding. Johann Sebastian remarked, “A pretty noise they must have made together! However, he learnt to keep time, and this apparently was the beginning of music in our family.”\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach (born March 21 [March 31, New Style], 1685, Eisenach, Thuringia, Ernestine Saxon Duchies [Germany]—died July 28, 1750, Leipzig) composer of the Baroque era , the most celebrated member of a large family of north German musicians. Although he was admired by his contemporaries primarily as an outstanding harpsichordist, organist, and expert on organ building, Bach is now generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time and is celebrated as the creator of the Brandenburg Concertos , The Well-Tempered Clavier , the Mass in B Minor, and numerous other masterpieces of church and instrumental music. Appearing at a propitious moment in the history of music , Bach was able to survey and bring together the principal styles, forms, and national traditions that had developed during preceding generations and, by virtue of his synthesis, enrich them all.\n\nJ.S. Bach was the youngest child of Johann Ambrosius Bach and Elisabeth Lämmerhirt. Ambrosius was a string player, employed by the town council and the ducal court of Eisenach. Johann Sebastian started school in 1692 or 1693 and did well in spite of frequent absences. Of his musical education at this time, nothing definite is known; however, he may have picked up the rudiments of string playing from his father, and no doubt he attended the Georgenkirche, where Johann Christoph Bach was organist until 1703. By 1695 both his parents were dead, and he was looked after by his eldest brother, also named Johann Christoph (1671–1721), organist at Ohrdruf. This Christoph had been a pupil of the influential keyboard composer Johann Pachelbel, and he apparently gave Johann Sebastian his first formal keyboard lessons. The young Bach again did well at school, and in 1700 his voice secured him a place in a select choir of poor boys at the school at Michaelskirche, Lüneburg. The Dating Game: Which Came First? His voice must have broken soon after this, but he remained at Lüneburg for a time, making himself generally useful. No doubt he studied in the school library, which had a large and up-to-date collection of church music; he probably heard Georg Böhm, organist of the Johanniskirche; and he visited Hamburg to hear the renowned organist and composer Johann Adam Reinken at the Katharinenkirche, contriving also to hear the French orchestra maintained by the duke of Celle. He seems to have returned to Thuringia in the late summer of 1702. By this time he was already a reasonably proficient organist. His experience at Lüneburg, if not at Ohrdruf, had turned him away from the secular string-playing tradition of his immediate ancestors; thenceforth he was chiefly, though not exclusively, a composer and performer of keyboard and sacred music. The next few months are wrapped in mystery, but by March 4, 1703, he was a member of the orchestra employed by Johann Ernst, duke of Weimar (and brother of Wilhelm Ernst, whose service Bach entered in 1708). This post was a mere stopgap; he probably already had his eye on the organ then being built at the Neue Kirche (New Church) in Arnstadt, for, when it was finished, he helped to test it, and in August 1703 he was appointed organist—all this at age 18. Arnstadt documents imply that he had been court organist at Weimar; this is incredible, though it is likely enough that he had occasionally played there.\n\nAt Arnstadt, on the northern edge of the Thuringian Forest, where he remained until 1707, Bach devoted himself to keyboard music, the organ in particular. While at Lüneburg he had apparently had no opportunity of becoming directly acquainted with the spectacular, flamboyant playing and compositions of Dietrich Buxtehude, the most significant exponent of the north German school of organ music. In October 1705 he repaired this gap in his knowledge by obtaining a month’s leave and walking to Lübeck (more than 200 miles [300 km]). His visit must have been profitable, for he did not return until about the middle of January 1706. In February his employers complained about his absence and about other things as well: he had harmonized the hymn tunes so freely that the congregation could not sing to his accompaniment, and, above all, he had produced no cantatas. Perhaps the real reasons for his neglect were that he was temporarily obsessed with the organ and was on bad terms with the local singers and instrumentalists, who were not under his control and did not come up to his standards. In the summer of 1705 he had made some offensive remark about a bassoon player, which led to an unseemly scuffle in the street. His replies to these complaints were neither satisfactory nor even accommodating; and the fact that he was not dismissed out of hand suggests that his employers were as well aware of his exceptional ability as he was himself and were reluctant to lose him. During these early years, Bach inherited the musical culture of the Thuringian area, a thorough familiarity with the traditional forms and hymns (chorales) of the orthodox Lutheran service, and, in keyboard music, perhaps (through his brother, Johann Christoph) a bias toward the formalistic styles of the south. But he also learned eagerly from the northern rhapsodists, Buxtehude above all. By 1708 he had probably learned all that his German predecessors could teach him and arrived at a first synthesis of northern and southern German styles. He had also studied, on his own and during his presumed excursions to Celle, some French organ and instrumental music. Among the few works that can be ascribed to these early years with anything more than a show of plausibility are the Capriccio sopra la lontananza del suo fratello dilettissimo (1704; Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Beloved Brother, BWV 992), the chorale prelude on Wie schön leuchtet (c. 1705; How Brightly Shines, BWV 739), and the fragmentary early version of the organ Prelude and Fugue in G Minor (before 1707, BWV 535a). (The “BWV” numbers provided are the standard catalog numbers of Bach’s works as established in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, prepared by the German musicologist Wolfgang Schmieder.)\n\nIn June 1707 Bach obtained a post at the Blasiuskirche in Mühlhausen in Thuringia. He moved there soon after and married his cousin Maria Barbara Bach at Dornheim on October 17. At Mühlhausen things seem, for a time, to have gone more smoothly. He produced several church cantatas at this time; all of these works are cast in a conservative mold, based on biblical and chorale texts and displaying no influence of the “modern” Italian operatic forms that were to appear in Bach’s later cantatas. The famous organ Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (BWV 565), written in the rhapsodic northern style, and the Prelude and Fugue in D Major (BWV 532) may also have been composed during the Mühlhausen period, as well as the organ Passacaglia in C Minor (BWV 582), an early example of Bach’s instinct for large-scale organization. Cantata No. 71, Gott ist mein König (God Is My King), of February 4, 1708, was printed at the expense of the city council and was the first of Bach’s compositions to be published. While at Mühlhausen, Bach copied music to enlarge the choir library, tried to encourage music in the surrounding villages, and was in sufficient favour to be able to interest his employers in a scheme for rebuilding the organ (February 1708). His real reason for resigning on June 25, 1708, is not known. He himself said that his plans for a “well-regulated [concerted] church music” had been hindered by conditions in Mühlhausen and that his salary was inadequate. It is generally supposed that he had become involved in a theological controversy between his own pastor Frohne and Archdeacon Eilmar of the Marienkirche. Certainly, he was friendly with Eilmar, who provided him with librettos and became godfather to Bach’s first child; and it is likely enough that he was not in sympathy with Frohne, who, as a Pietist, would have frowned on elaborate church music. It is just as possible, however, that it was the dismal state of musical life in Mühlhausen that prompted Bach to seek employment elsewhere. At all events, his resignation was accepted, and shortly afterward he moved to Weimar, some miles west of Jena on the Ilm River. He continued nevertheless to be on good terms with Mühlhausen personalities, for he supervised the rebuilding of the organ, is supposed to have inaugurated it on October 31, 1709, and composed a cantata for February 4, 1709, which was printed but has disappeared.\n\nBach was, from the outset, court organist at Weimar and a member of the orchestra. Encouraged by Wilhelm Ernst, he concentrated on the organ during the first few years of his tenure. From Weimar, Bach occasionally visited Weissenfels; in February 1713 he took part in a court celebration there that included a performance of his first secular cantata, Was mir behagt, also called the Hunt Cantata (BWV 208). Late in 1713 Bach had the opportunity of succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow at the Liebfrauenkirche, Halle; but the duke raised his salary, and he stayed on at Weimar. On March 2, 1714, he became concertmaster, with the duty of composing a cantata every month. He became friendly with a relative, Johann Gottfried Walther, a music lexicographer and composer who was organist of the town church, and, like Walther, Bach took part in the musical activities at the Gelbes Schloss (“Yellow Castle”), then occupied by Duke Wilhelm’s two nephews, Ernst August and Johann Ernst, both of whom he taught. The latter was a talented composer who wrote concerti in the Italian manner, some of which Bach arranged for keyboard instruments; the boy died in 1715, in his 19th year. Unfortunately, Bach’s development cannot be traced in detail during the vital years 1708–14, when his style underwent a profound change. There are too few datable works. From the series of cantatas written in 1714–16, however, it is obvious that he had been decisively influenced by the new styles and forms of the contemporary Italian opera and by the innovations of such Italian concerto composers as Antonio Vivaldi. The results of this encounter can be seen in such cantatas as No. 182, 199, and 61 in 1714, 31 and 161 in 1715, and 70 and 147 in 1716. His favourite forms appropriated from the Italians were those based on refrain (ritornello) or da capo schemes in which wholesale repetition—literal or with modifications—of entire sections of a piece permitted him to create coherent musical forms with much larger dimensions than had hitherto been possible. These newly acquired techniques henceforth governed a host of Bach’s arias and concerto movements, as well as many of his larger fugues (especially the mature ones for organ), and profoundly affected his treatment of chorales. Among other works almost certainly composed at Weimar are most of the Orgelbüchlein (Little Organ Book), all but the last of the so-called 18 “Great” chorale preludes, the earliest organ trios, and most of the organ preludes and fugues. The “Great” Prelude and Fugue in G Major for organ (BWV 541) was finally revised about 1715, and the Toccata and Fugue in F Major (BWV 540) may have been played at Weissenfels. On December 1, 1716, Johann Samuel Drese, musical director at Weimar, died. He was then succeeded by his son, who was rather a nonentity. Bach presumably resented being thus passed over, and in due course he accepted an appointment as musical director to Prince Leopold of Köthen, which was confirmed in August 1717. Duke Wilhelm, however, refused to accept his resignation—partly, perhaps, because of Bach’s friendship with the duke’s nephews, with whom the duke was on the worst of terms. About September a contest between Bach and the famous French organist Louis Marchand was arranged at Dresden. The exact circumstances are not known, but Marchand avoided the contest by leaving Dresden a few hours before it should have taken place. By implication, Bach won. Perhaps this emboldened him to renew his request for permission to leave Weimar; at all events he did so but in such terms that the duke imprisoned him for a month (November 6–December 2). A few days after his release, Bach moved to Köthen, some 30 miles north of Halle.\n\nIn May 1747 he visited his son Emanuel at Potsdam and played before Frederick II (the Great) of Prussia; in July his improvisations, on a theme proposed by the king, took shape as The Musical Offering. In June 1747 he joined a Society of the Musical Sciences that had been founded by his former pupil Lorenz Christoph Mizler; he presented the canonic variations on the chorale Vom Himmel hoch da komm’ ich her (From Heaven Above to Earth I Come) to the society, in manuscript, and afterward published them. Of Bach’s last illness little is known except that it lasted several months and prevented him from finishing The Art of the Fugue. His constitution was undermined by two unsuccessful eye operations performed by John Taylor, the itinerant English quack who numbered Handel among his other failures; and Bach died on July 28, 1750, at Leipzig. His employers proceeded with relief to appoint a successor; Burgomaster Stieglitz remarked, “The school needs a cantor, not a musical director—though certainly he ought to understand music.” Anna Magdalena was left badly off. For some reason, her stepsons did nothing to help her, and her own sons were too young to do so. She died on February 27, 1760, and was given a pauper’s funeral. Unfinished as it was, The Art of the Fugue was published in 1751. It attracted little attention and was reissued in 1752 with a laudatory preface by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg, a well-known Berlin musician who later became director of the royal lottery. In spite of Marpurg and of some appreciative remarks by Johann Mattheson, the influential Hamburg critic and composer, only about 30 copies had been sold by 1756, when Emanuel Bach offered the plates for sale. As far as is known, they were sold for scrap. Emanuel Bach and the organist-composer Johann Friedrich Agricola (a pupil of Sebastian’s) wrote an obituary; Mizler added a few closing words and published the result in the journal of his society (1754). There is an English translation of it in The Bach Reader. Though incomplete and inaccurate, the obituary is of very great importance as a firsthand source of information. Bach appears to have been a good husband and father. Indeed, he was the father of 20 children, only 10 of whom survived to maturity. There is amusing evidence of a certain thriftiness—a necessary virtue, for he was never more than moderately well off and he delighted in hospitality. Living as he did at a time when music was beginning to be regarded as no occupation for a gentleman, he occasionally had to stand up for his rights both as a man and as a musician; he was then obstinate in the extreme. But no sympathetic employer had any trouble with Bach, and with his professional brethren he was modest and friendly. He was also a good teacher and from his Mühlhausen days onward was never without pupils.Johann Sebastian Bach: Johann Sebastian Bach was better known as a virtuoso organist than as a composer in his day. His sacred music, organ and choral works, and other instrumental music had an enthusiasm and seeming freedom that concealed immense rigor. Bach's use of counterpoint was brilliant and innovative, and the immense complexities of his compositional style -- which often included religious and numerological symbols that seem to fit perfectly together in a profound puzzle of special codes -- still amaze musicians today. Many consider him the greatest composer of all time. Bach was born in Eisenach in 1685. He was taught to play the violin and harpsichord by his father, Johann Ambrosius, a court trumpeter in the service of the Duke of Eisenach. Young Johann was not yet ten when his father died, leaving him orphaned. He was taken in by his recently married oldest brother, Johann Christoph , who lived in Ohrdruf. Because of his excellent singing voice, Bach attained a position at the Michaelis monastery at Lüneberg in 1700. His voice changed a short while later, but he stayed on as an instrumentalist. After taking a short-lived post in Weimar in 1703 as a violinist, Bach became organist at the Neue Kirche in Arnstadt (1703-1707). His relationship with the church council was tenuous as the young musician often shirked his responsibilities, preferring to practice the organ. One account describes a four-month leave granted Bach, to travel to Lubeck where he would familiarize himself with the music of Dietrich Buxtehude . He returned to Arnstadt long after he was expected and much to the dismay of the council. He then briefly served at St. Blasius in Mühlhausen as organist, beginning in June 1707, and married his cousin, Maria Barbara Bach, that fall. Bach composed his famous Toccata and Fugue in D minor (BWV 565) and his first cantatas while in Mühlhausen, but quickly outgrew the musical resources of the town. He next took a post for the Duke of Sachsen-Weimar in 1708, serving as court organist and playing in the orchestra, eventually becoming its leader in 1714. He wrote many organ compositions during this period, including his Orgel-Büchlein. Owing to politics between the Duke and his officials, Bach left Weimar and secured a post in December 1717 as Kapellmeister at Cöthen. In 1720, Bach's wife suddenly died, leaving him with four children (three others had died in infancy). A short while later, he met his second wife, soprano Anna Magdalena Wilcke, whom he married in December 1721. She would bear 13 children, though only five would survive childhood. The six Brandenburg Concertos (BWV 1046-51), among many other secular works, date from his Cöthen years. Bach became Kantor of the Thomas School in Leipzig in May 1723 and held the post until his death. It was in Leipzig that he composed the bulk of his religious and secular cantatas. Bach eventually became dissatisfied with this post, not only because of its meager financial rewards, but also because of onerous duties and inadequate facilities. Thus, he took on other projects, chief among which was the directorship of the city's Collegium Musicum , an ensemble of professional and amateur musicians who gave weekly concerts, in 1729. He also became music director at the Dresden Court in 1736, in the service of Frederick Augustus II; though his duties were vague and apparently few, they allowed him freedom to compose what he wanted. Bach began making trips to Berlin in the 1740s, not least because his son Carl Philipp Emanuel served as a court musician there. In May 1747, the composer was warmly received by King Frederick II of Prussia, for whom he wrote the gloriously abstruse Musical Offering (BWV 1079). Among Bach's last works was his 1749 Mass in B minor. Besieged by diabetes, he died on July 28, 1750.Johann Sebastian Bach - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Johann Sebastian Bach (pronunciado /ˈjoːhan zeˈbasti̯an bax/ⓘ; Eisenach, Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico, 21 de marzojul./ 31 de marzo de 1685greg.-Leipzig, Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico, 28 de julio de 1750) fue un compositor, músico, director de orquesta, maestro de capilla, cantor y profesor alemán del período barroco.\n\nFue el miembro más importante de una de las familias de músicos más destacadas de la historia, con más de 35 compositores famosos: la familia Bach. Tuvo una gran fama como organista y clavecinista en toda Europa por su gran técnica y capacidad de improvisar música al teclado. Además del órgano y del clavecín, tocaba el violín y la viola da gamba.\n\nSu fecunda obra es considerada la cima de la música barroca; destaca en ella su profundidad intelectual, su perfección técnica y su belleza artística, además de la síntesis de los diversos estilos nacionales de su época y del pasado. Bach es considerado el último gran maestro del arte del contrapunto[1]​ y fuente de inspiración e influencia para posteriores compositores y músicos, tales como Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann y Frédéric Chopin, entre muchos otros.\n\nEntre sus obras más conocidas se encuentran los Conciertos de Brandeburgo, El clave bien temperado, la Misa en si menor, la Pequeña fuga en sol menor, la Pasión según San Mateo, El arte de la fuga, Ofrenda musical, las Variaciones Goldberg, la Tocata y fuga en re menor, varios ciclos de cantatas (entre ellas las célebres Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140 y Herz und Mund und Tat und Leben, BWV 147), el Concierto italiano, BWV 971, la Obertura en estilo francés, BWV 831, las Suites para violonchelo solo, las Sonatas y partitas para violín solo, los Conciertos para teclado y las Suites para orquesta. ​\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach pertenecía a una de las más destacadas familias musicales de la historia. Durante más de doscientos años, la familia Bach produjo buenos intérpretes y compositores. En aquella época, la Iglesia luterana, el gobierno local y la aristocracia daban una significativa aportación para la formación de músicos profesionales, particularmente en los electorados orientales de Turingia y Sajonia. El padre de Johann Sebastian, Johann Ambrosius Bach, era un talentoso violinista y trompetista en Eisenach, una ciudad con cerca de 6000 habitantes en Turingia. El puesto involucraba la organización de la música profana y la participación en la música eclesiástica. Los tíos de Johann Sebastian eran todos músicos profesionales, entre cuyos cargos había organistas de iglesia, músicos de cámara de la corte y compositores. Bach era consciente de los logros musicales de su familia y hacia 1735 esbozó una genealogía, Ursprung der musikalisch-Bachischen Familie (Origen de la familia musical Bach), buscando la historia de las generaciones de los exitosos músicos de su familia. ​[a]​\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach nació en Eisenach, Ducado de Sajonia-Eisenach (en la actual Turingia, Alemania), el 21 de marzo de 1685, el mismo año que Georg Friedrich Händel y Domenico Scarlatti. La fecha de su nacimiento corresponde al calendario juliano, pues los alemanes aún no habían adoptado el calendario gregoriano, según el cual la fecha corresponde al 31 de marzo. Era el octavo hijo (el hijo mayor tenía 14 años cuando nació Johann Sebastian)[4]​ del matrimonio formado por Maria Elisabetha Lämmerhirt y Johann Ambrosius Bach, director de los músicos de la ciudad. ​ Su padre fue quien le enseñó probablemente a tocar el violín y los fundamentos de la teoría musical. ​ Su tío Johann Christoph Bach lo introdujo en la práctica del órgano.\n\nSu madre falleció en 1694, cuando Johann Sebastian tenía nueve años, y su padre —que ya le había dado las primeras lecciones de música— falleció ocho meses después. ​ Johann Sebastian, huérfano con diez años, se fue a vivir y estudiar con su hermano mayor, Johann Christoph Bach, organista en la iglesia de San Miguel (Michaeliskirche) de Ohrdruf, una ciudad cercana. ​ Allí copiaba, estudiaba e interpretaba música, incluyendo la de su propio hermano, a pesar de estarle prohibido hacerlo porque las partituras eran muy valiosas y privadas y el papel de ese tipo era costoso. ​ ​ Aprendió teoría musical y composición, además de tocar el órgano, y recibió lecciones de su hermano, que lo adiestró en la interpretación del clavecín. Johann Christoph le dio a conocer las obras de los grandes compositores del Sur de Alemania de la época, como Johann Pachelbel (que había sido maestro de Johann Christoph) ​ y Johann Jakob Froberger; de compositores del Norte de Alemania; ​ de los franceses, como Jean-Baptiste Lully, Louis Marchand y Marin Marais, así como del clavecinista italiano Girolamo Frescobaldi. También en esa época estudió teología, latín, griego, francés e italiano en el gymnasium de la localidad.[13]​\n\nEn 1700, a los catorce años de edad, Johann Sebastian fue premiado, junto a su amigo del colegio Georg Erdmann, dos años mayor que él, con una matrícula para realizar estudios corales en la prestigiosa Escuela de San Miguel en Luneburgo, no muy lejos del puerto marítimo de Hamburgo, una de las ciudades más grandes del Sacro Imperio. ​ ​ Esto conllevaba un largo viaje con su amigo, que probablemente realizaron en parte a pie y en parte en carroza, aunque no se sabe con certeza.[13]​ No hay referencias escritas de este período de su vida, pero los dos años de estancia en la escuela parecen haber sido decisivos por haberle expuesto a una paleta más amplia de la cultura europea que la que había experimentado en Turingia. Además de cantar en el coro a capela, es probable que tocase el órgano con tres teclados y sus clavicémbalos.[13]​ Quizás entró en contacto con los hijos de los nobles del norte de Alemania, que eran enviados a esta escuela selectísima para prepararse en sus carreras diplomáticas, gubernamentales y militares. ​\n\nAunque existen pocas evidencias históricas que lo sustenten, es casi seguro que durante la estancia en Luneburgo, el joven Bach visitó la iglesia de San Juan (Johanniskirche) y escuchó (y posiblemente tocó) el famoso órgano de la iglesia (construido en 1549 por Jasper Johannsen, y conocido como «el órgano de Böhm» debido a su intérprete más destacado). ​ Dado su talento musical, es muy probable asimismo que tuviese un significativo contacto con los organistas destacados del momento en Luneburgo, muy particularmente con Georg Böhm (el organista de la Johanniskirche), así como con organistas de la cercana Hamburgo, como Johann Adam Reincken y Nicolaus Bruhns. ​[19]​ Gracias al contacto con estos músicos, Johann Sebastian tuvo acceso probablemente a los instrumentos más grandes y precisos que había tocado hasta entonces. En esta etapa se familiarizó con la música de la tradición académica organística del norte de Alemania, especialmente con la obra de Dietrich Buxtehude, organista en la iglesia de Santa María de Lübeck, y con manuscritos musicales y tratados de teoría musical que estaban en posesión de aquellos músicos.[20]​ Stauffer informó del descubrimiento en 2005 de las tablaturas de órganos que escribió Bach, aun en su adolescencia, de obras de Reincken y Dietrich Buxtehude, que muestra «un adolescente disciplinado, metódico y bien entrenado profundamente comprometido con el aprendizaje de su oficio».[19]​\n\nEn enero de 1703, poco después de terminar los estudios y graduarse en San Miguel y de ser rechazado para el puesto de organista en Sangerhausen, ​[b]​ Bach logró un puesto como músico de la corte en la capilla del duque Juan Ernesto III en Weimar. ​ No está claro cuál fue su papel allí, pero parece que incluía tareas domésticas no musicales. Durante los siete meses de servicio en Weimar, su reputación como teclista se extendió tanto que fue invitado a inspeccionar el flamante órgano de la iglesia de San Bonifacio (St.-Bonifatius-Kirche, posteriormente Bachkirche, «iglesia de Bach») de la cercana ciudad de Arnstadt, a 40 kilómetros al sureste de Weimar, y a dar el concierto inaugural en él. ​ La familia Bach tenía estrechos vínculos con esta vieja ciudad de Turingia, al lado del bosque de Turingia. En agosto de 1703, aceptó el puesto de organista en dicha iglesia,[24]​ con obligaciones ligeras, un salario relativamente generoso y un buen órgano nuevo, afinado conforme a un sistema reciente que permitía el uso de un mayor número de teclas. ​ En esa época, Bach estaba emprendiendo la composición seria de preludios para órgano; estas obras, inscritas en la tradición del norte de Alemania de preludios virtuosos e improvisados, ya mostraban un estricto control de los motivos (en ellos, una idea musical sencilla y breve se explora en sus consecuencias a través de todo un movimiento). Sin embargo, en estas obras el compositor aún no había desarrollado plenamente su capacidad de organización a gran escala y su técnica contrapuntística, donde dos o más melodías interactúan simultáneamente. ​\n\nLas fuertes conexiones familiares y el hecho de estar empleado por un entusiasta de la música no impidieron que surgieran tensiones entre el joven organista y las autoridades después de varios años en el cargo. Johann Sebastian estaba insatisfecho con el nivel de los cantantes del coro. Llamó a uno de ellos «zippel Fagottist» (fagotista flojo). Una noche, este estudiante llamado Geyersbach fue tras él con un palo. Bach presentó una denuncia contra él ante las autoridades. Absolvieron a Geyersbach con una pequeña reprimenda y ordenaron a Bach que fuera más moderado con respecto a las cualidades musicales que esperaba de sus alumnos. Meses después, su empleador se mostró muy molesto después de que Bach se ausentara de Arnstadt sin autorización durante cuatro meses (había pedido permiso para ausentarse cuatro semanas) en el invierno de 1705-1706 para visitar en Lübeck al gran maestro Dietrich Buxtehude y asistir a sus Abendmusiken en la iglesia de Santa María (Marienkirche). Este episodio bien conocido de la vida del compositor implica que tuvo que andar a pie unos 400 kilómetros de ida y otros tantos de vuelta para pasar el tiempo con el hombre al que posiblemente consideraba como la figura máxima entre los organistas alemanes. ​[28]​ El viaje reforzó el influjo del estilo de Buxtehude como fundamento de la obra temprana de Bach, y el hecho de que alargase su visita durante varios meses sugiere que el tiempo que pasó con el anciano tuvo un alto valor para su arte. Johann Sebastian quería convertirse en amanuense (asistente o sucesor) de Buxtehude, pero no quiso casarse con su hija, que era la condición para su nombramiento.[29]​\n\nEn 1706, le ofrecieron un puesto mejor pagado como organista en la iglesia de San Blas (Divi-Blasii-Kirche) de Mühlhausen, una importante ciudad al norte. ​ ​ El año siguiente tomó posesión de este mejor puesto, con paga y condiciones significativamente superiores, incluyendo un buen coro. ​ A los cuatro meses de haber llegado a Mühlhausen se casó, el 17 de octubre de 1707, con Maria Barbara Bach, una prima suya en segundo grado, con quien tendría siete hijos, de los cuales cuatro alcanzaron la edad adulta. ​ Dos de ellos —Wilhelm Friedemann[33]​ y Carl Philipp Emanuel—[34]​ llegaron a ser compositores importantes en el ornamentado estilo galante que siguió al barroco.\n\nEl ayuntamiento de la ciudad aceptó los requerimientos de Bach e invirtió una gran suma en la renovación del órgano de la iglesia de San Blas. En 1708, Johann Sebastian escribió la cantata festiva Gott ist mein König, BWV 71 para la inauguración del nuevo concejo de la ciudad, cuya publicación fue costeada por el ayuntamiento. En dos ocasiones, en años posteriores, el compositor tuvo que regresar para dirigirla.[13]​\n\nTranscurrido apenas un año, le llegó en 1708 una nueva oferta de trabajo como organista desde la corte ducal en Weimar, por lo que abandonó su puesto en Mühlhausen. Allí, tuvo la oportunidad de trabajar con un contingente grande y bien financiado de músicos profesionales.[13]​ Bach se trasladó con su familia a un apartamento muy cercano al palacio ducal.[35]​ Ese mismo año nació su primera hija, Catharina Dorothea. Se fue a vivir con ellos la hermana mayor y soltera de Maria Barbara, que permaneció con ellos ayudando en las tareas domésticas hasta su muerte en 1729. También nacieron tres hijos en Weimar: Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel y Johann Gottfried Bernhard. Tuvieron tres hijos más, que, sin embargo, no vivieron hasta su primer cumpleaños, incluidos los gemelos nacidos en 1713. ​\n\nEste período en la vida de Bach fue fructífero y comenzó una época de composición de obras para teclado y orquestales. Alcanzó el nivel de competencia y confianza para ampliar las estructuras existentes e incluir influencias del exterior. A la muerte del príncipe Juan Ernesto en 1707, su hermano Guillermo Ernesto había asumido el poder de facto. Por su anterior cercanía con el duque Juan Ernesto, que había sido a su vez un avezado músico y admirador de la música italiana, Bach había estudiado y transcrito las obras de Antonio Vivaldi, Arcangelo Corelli y Giuseppe Torelli, entre otros autores italianos, gracias a lo cual había aprendido a escribir aperturas dramáticas y a emplear los ritmos dinámicos y los esquemas armónicos que se encontraban en dicha música, asimilando su dinamismo y emotividad armónica, y aplicando dichas cualidades a sus propias composiciones, que a su vez eran interpretadas por el conjunto musical del duque Guillermo Ernesto. Absorbió estos aspectos estilísticos en parte mediante la transcripción de conciertos para cuerda y viento de Vivaldi a clavecín y órgano; muchas de esas obras transcritas son todavía interpretadas con frecuencia. Se sintió atraído especialmente con el estilo italiano en el que uno o más instrumentos solistas alternan sección por sección con la orquesta completa a través de un movimiento.[37]​ ​ ​\n\nContinuó tocando y componiendo para órgano e interpretando música de concierto con el conjunto del duque.[13]​ También comenzó a componer preludios y fugas, posteriormente recopilados en su obra monumental El clave bien temperado (Das Wohltemperierte Klavier), ​ impresa por primera vez en 1801, que consta de dos libros compilados en 1722 y 1744, ​ cada uno de los cuales contiene un preludio y fuga en cada tonalidad mayor y menor. Empezó a escribir el Orgelbüchlein (Pequeño libro para órgano), obra didáctica que dejó inconclusa. Contenía corales tradicionales luteranas arreglados en elaboraciones complejas para formar organistas. ​\n\nEn 1713, le ofrecieron un puesto en Halle cuando aconsejó a las autoridades durante la renovación de Christoph Cuntzius del órgano principal de la galería oeste de la Marktkirche Unser Lieben Frauen.[43]​ ​ Johann Kuhnau y Bach volvieron a tocar cuando se inauguró en 1716.[45]​[46]​ En la primavera de 1714, Johann Sebastian fue ascendido a Konzertmeister, un honor que implicaba realizar mensualmente una cantata de iglesia en la iglesia del palacio. ​ Las tres primeras cantatas de la nueva serie compuesta por Bach en Weimar fueron Himmelskönig, sei willkommen, BWV 182, para el Domingo de Ramos, que coincidió con la Anunciación de ese año; Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12, para el Domingo de júbilo; y Erschallet, ihr Lieder, erklinget, ihr Saiten!, BWV 172 para Pentecostés. ​ Su primera cantata navideña, Christen, ätzet diesen Tag, BWV 63, se estrenó aquí posiblemente en 1713.[49]​ o si fue interpretada para el bicentenario de la Reforma Protestante en 1717.[50]​\n\nEn 1717, ocurre en Dresde el anecdótico intento de duelo musical con Louis Marchand (se dice que Marchand abandonó la ciudad tras escuchar previamente y a escondidas a Bach).[51]​ Ese mismo año, con motivo del fallecimiento del maestro de capilla (o Kapellmeister) de la corte de Anhalt-Köthen y con la mediación del duque Ernesto Augusto —sobrino de Guillermo Ernesto, con quien se hallaba a la sazón en pleitos en aquel entonces—, el príncipe Leopoldo ofreció a Bach el puesto vacante, que aceptó. Esto disgustó al duque de Weimar y cuando el compositor presentó su renuncia, ordenó que le arrestaran por algunas semanas en el castillo antes de aceptarla. ​[13]​ Según una traducción del informe del secretario del tribunal, fue encarcelado durante casi un mes antes de ser despedido desfavorablemente:\n\nEl príncipe Leopoldo de Anhalt-Köthen contrató a Bach como maestro de capilla en 1717. El príncipe Leopoldo, que también era músico, apreciaba su talento, le pagaba bien y le dio un tiempo considerable para componer y tocar. Sin embargo, el príncipe era calvinista y no solía usar música elaborada en sus oficios religiosos. Por esa razón, la mayoría de sus obras de este período fueron profanas. ​ Como ejemplo están las Suites para orquesta, las seis Suites para violonchelo solo, las Sonatas y partitas para violín solo y los Conciertos de Brandeburgo. ​ También compuso cantatas profanas para la corte, como Die Zeit, die Tag und Jahre macht, BWV 134a.\n\nA pesar de haber nacido en el mismo año y de estar separados únicamente por alrededor de 130 kilómetros, Bach y Georg Friedrich Händel nunca se conocieron. En 1719, Johann Sebastian realizó un viaje de unos treinta kilómetros desde Köthen hasta Halle con la intención de conocer a Händel, pero este había abandonado recientemente la ciudad. ​ En 1730, Wilhelm Friedemann, hijo de Johann Sebastian, se fue a Halle para invitar a Händel a visitar a la familia Bach en Leipzig. Sin embargo, dicha visita nunca tuvo lugar. ​\n\nEl 7 de julio de 1720, mientras Bach estaba de viaje con el príncipe Leopoldo en Karlovy Vary (en alemán ‘’Karlsbad’’) su esposa, Maria Barbara Bach, murió repentinamente. Algunos especialistas señalan que en memoria de ella compuso la Partita para violín solo n.º 2, BWV 1004, en especial, su última sección, la «Chacona». Al año siguiente, conoció a Anna Magdalena Wilcke, una joven y talentosa soprano, 16 años más joven que él, que cantaba en la corte de Köthen. Se casaron el 3 de diciembre de 1721. ​ Juntos tuvieron trece hijos más, seis de los cuales alcanzaron la edad adulta: Gottfried Heinrich, Johann Christoph Friedrich y Johann Christian, que llegaron a ser músicos destacados; Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726-81), quien se casó con el alumno de su padre Johann Christoph Altnickol; Johanna Carolina (1737-81); y Regina Susanna (1742-1809). ​\n\nJohann Kuhnau había sido Thomaskantor de la Thomasschule en la iglesia luterana de Santo Tomás (Thomaskirche) de Leipzig desde 1701 hasta su muerte el 5 de junio de 1722. Bach había visitado Leipzig durante el mandato de Kuhnau: en 1714 asistió al culto en la iglesia de Santo Tomás el primer domingo de Adviento, ​ y en 1717 había probado el órgano de la Paulinerkirche. ​ En 1716, Bach y Kuhnau se habían reunido con motivo de la prueba e inauguración de un órgano en Halle. ​\n\nDespués de que le ofrecieran el puesto, invitaron a Bach a Leipzig solo después de que Georg Philipp Telemann indicara que no estaba interesado en trasladarse a Leipzig.[62]​ Telemann se fue a Hamburgo, donde «tuvo sus propias luchas con el Senado de la ciudad». ​\n\nEn 1723, Bach fue nombrado Thomaskantor y director musical de las principales iglesias de la ciudad, San Nicolás (Nikolaikirche) y San Pablo (Paulinerkirche), la iglesia de la Universidad. ​ Era un prestigioso puesto en la ciudad mercantil líder del Electorado de Sajonia, un electorado vecino de Turingia. ​ Aparte de sus breves ocupaciones en Arnstadt y Mühlhausen, este fue el primer trabajo estatal de Bach, en una carrera que había estado estrechamente ligada al servicio a la aristocracia. Durante ese tiempo, ganó más prestigio a través de nombramientos honorarios en las cortes de Köthen y Weissenfels, así como en la del elector Augusto II de Polonia en Dresde. ​ El compositor no solía estar de acuerdo con con su empleador, el concejo municipal de Leipzig, al que consideraba «tacaño». ​\n\nEste puesto, que mantuvo durante 27 años hasta su muerte, lo puso en contacto con las maquinaciones políticas de su empleador, el Ayuntamiento de Leipzig, dentro del cual había dos facciones: los absolutistas, leales al monarca sajón en Dresde, Augusto II de Polonia, y la facción de la ciudad-estado, que representaba los intereses de la clase mercantil, los gremios y los aristócratas menores. Los monárquicos fueron quienes lo contrataron, en particular por el alcalde de aquella época, Gottfried Lange, un abogado joven que había servido en la corte de Dresde. Coincidiendo con el nombramiento de Bach, a la facción de la ciudad-estado se le otorgó el control de la Thomasschule y se le requirió para varios compromisos con respecto a sus condiciones de trabajo. ​ ​\n\nEl trabajo de Bach consistía en instruir a los estudiantes de la Thomasschule en el canto y proveer semanalmente de música sacra a las principales iglesias de la ciudad. Además, tenía que enseñar latín, pero le permitieron emplear a cuatro ayudantes para que lo hicieran en su lugar, así como para ayudarle en la instrucción musical. ​ Le encargaron una cantata para el culto de los domingos y días festivos en la iglesia durante el año litúrgico.\n\nBach interpretaba habitualmente sus propias cantatas, muchas de las cuales las compuso durante sus primeros tres años en Leipzig. La primera de ellas fue Die Elenden sollen essen, BWV 75, estrenada en la Nikolaikirche el 30 de mayo de 1723, el primer domingo después del Domingo de Trinidad. Recopiló sus cantatas en ciclos anuales. Cinco son mencionados en sus obituarios, aunque solo existen tres. ​ La mayoría de estas obras se utilizaban en las lecturas del Evangelio prescritas para cada domingo y día festivo en el año luterano. ​ Comenzó un segundo ciclo anual el primer domingo después del de Trinidad de 1724 y compuso únicamente cantatas con coro; muchas de ellas fueron compuestas usando corales, himnos tradicionales de la Iglesia luterana, tal como O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 20; Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140; Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 62; y Wie schön leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1. ​\n\nPara los ensayos e interpretaciones de estas obras en la iglesia de Santo Tomás, probablemente se sentaba al clave o dirigía frente al coro de espaldas a la congregación. Detrás del coro y a un nivel por encima estaba el órgano y, en sendas galerías laterales a izquierda y derecha, las cuerdas, los vientos, la percusión y el bajo continuo. ​\n\nEl ayuntamiento solo autorizaba alrededor de ocho instrumentistas permanentes, limitación que fue fuente de constante fricción con Bach, que tuvo que reclutar al resto de los veinte o más músicos -requeridos para las partituras medianas o grandes- en la universidad, la Thomasschule y el público. ​ Bach seleccionaba a los coristas: sopranos y contraltos de la Thomasschule y tenores y bajos de la Thomasschule y de cualquier lugar de Leipzig. Las actuaciones en bodas y funerales daban un ingreso extra a estos grupos. Es probable que para este propósito, y para el entrenamiento escolar, escribiese al menos seis motetes, la mayoría para doble coro.[73]​ Como parte de su trabajo regular en la iglesia dirigía motetes de la Escuela veneciana y de alemanes, como Heinrich Schütz, que servirían como modelos formales para sus propios motetes.[13]​\n\nEl predecesor de Bach como Thomaskantor, Johann Kuhnau, también había sido director musical de la Paulinerkirche, la iglesia de la Universidad de Leipzig. Pero cuando Bach se instaló como Thomaskantor en 1723, se le puso a cargo solo de la música para los cultos festivos de la iglesia Paulinerkirche. Su petición de proporcionar también música para los cultos gndominicales regulares allí (con su correspondiente aumento salarial) llegó hasta el elector, pero fue denegada. Después de esto, en 1725, Bach «perdió interés» en trabajar incluso para los servicios festivos en la Paulinerkirche y apareció allí solo en «ocasiones especiales». ​ La Paulinerkirche tenía un órgano mucho mejor y más nuevo (1716) que los de la Thomaskirche o la Nikolaikirche. ​ Bach no estaba obligado a tocar ningún órgano en sus deberes oficiales, pero se cree que le gustaba tocar en el órgano de la Paulinerkirche «por su propio placer». ​\n\nAmplió sus horizontes compositivos más allá de la liturgia al hacerse cargo, en marzo de 1729, de la dirección del Collegium Musicum, una sociedad musical de estudiantes fundada en 1703 por Georg Philipp Telemann. Esta era una de las docenas de sociedades privadas creadas por estudiantes universitarios activos musicalmente que existían en las principales ciudades germanoparlantes y que, lideradas por los músicos profesionales más destacados de cada ciudad, se fueron adquiriendo progresivamente importancia en la vida pública musical. En palabras de Christoph Wolff, asumir la dirección fue un movimiento astuto que «consolidó el firme control que ejercía Bach sobre las principales instituciones musicales de Leipzig». ​ Durante todo el año, el Collegium Musicum de Leipzig actuaba regularmente en escenarios como la Cafetería Zimmermann (Zimmermannsches Caffeehaus), una cafetería en la calle Sainte Catherine frente a la plaza del mercado. Muchas de sus obras durante las décadas de 1730 y 1740 las escribió para el Collegium Musicum y este las interpretó. Entre esas obras se encuentran parte de sus Clavier-Übung y muchos de sus conciertos para violín y clave.[13]​\n\nSi bien está claro que nadie en el ayuntamiento dudaba de su genio, hubo una constante tensión entre el Kantor, que se consideraba el líder de la música eclesial de la ciudad, y la facción de la ciudad-estado, que lo veía como un maestro de escuela y quería reducir el énfasis en la composición de música tanto para la iglesia como para la Thomasschule. A partir de 1730, la facción de la ciudad-estado estaba encabezada por el teólogo y filólogo Johann August Ernesti. Profesor en la Universidad de Leipzig, Ernesti, junto con buena parte del claustro de la Universidad, propugnaba un cambio de modelo educativo que se reorientaría hacia disciplinas más ilustradas, como las ciencias naturales o la filología. Las múltiples prerrogativas de Bach como Kantor de Santo Tomás chocaban con esta pretensión, por lo que pronto surgió una agria disputa entre ambos, que pretendía relegar la importancia de la música a un segundo puesto, y retirar al Kantor toda competencia en materia educativa. El nivel de la disputa llegó a tal punto que Bach pidió ayuda al rey de Polonia, gran duque de Lituania y elector de Sajonia, Augusto III, que intervino a su favor. El hecho de que hiciera intervenir al elector de Sajonia escandalizó a la corporación de Leipzig, que consideraba el asunto un tema local, e interpretó su actitud como propia de alguien con delirios de grandeza. Tras la disputa, las relaciones entre Bach y sus patronos locales se degradaron rápidamente. Sea como fuera, el ayuntamiento nunca cumplió la promesa —que hizo Lange en la entrevista inicial— de ofrecer un salario de 1000 táleros anuales, si bien se le ofreció a él y a su familia una reducción de impuestos y un buen apartamento en una de las alas de la Thomasschule, que renovaron con gran gasto en 1732. ​ ​\n\nEn 1733, Bach compuso el «Kyrie» y «Gloria» de la Misa en si menor. Presentó el manuscrito a Augusto III, en un intento —finalmente exitoso- de persuadir al monarca para que lo nombrara Compositor Real de la Corte.[81]​ Posteriormente extendió dicha obra en una misa completa, añadiendo un «Credo», «Sanctus» y «Agnus Dei», música sacada casi por completo de sus propias cantatas. El nombramiento de Bach como compositor de la corte fue parte de su larga disputa para conseguir un mayor poder de negociación con el ayuntamiento de Leipzig. Aunque la misa completa nunca se representó probablemente en vida del compositor,[82]​ está considerada una de las obras corales más grandes de todos los tiempos.[83]​ Entre 1737 y 1739, el antiguo alumno de Bach Carl Gotthelf Gerlach asumió el puesto de director del Collegium Musicum.\n\nEn 1735, comenzó a preparar la primera publicación de su música de órgano, que se imprimió como el tercer Clavier-Übung en 1739.[84]​ A partir de ese año empezó a compilar y componer el conjunto de preludios y fugas para clavecín que se convertiría en su segundo libro de El clave bien temperado.[85]​\n\nDe 1740 a 1748 copió, transcribió, amplió o programó música en un estilo polifónico más antiguo (stile antico), entre otros, de Palestrina (BNB I/P/2),[86]​ Kerll (BWV 241),[87]​ Torri (BWV Anh. 30),[88]​ Bassani (BWV 1081),[89]​ Gasparini (Missa Canonica)[90]​ y Caldara (BWV 1082).[91]​ El estilo propio de Bach cambió en la última década de su vida, mostrando una mayor integración de estructuras polifónicas y cánones y otros elementos del stile antico.[92]​ Su cuarto y último volumen de Clavier-Übung, las Variaciones Goldberg, para clave de dos manuales, contenía nueve cánones y se publicó en 1741.[93]​ Durante este período, Bach también continuó adoptando música de contemporáneos, como Händel (BNB I/K/2)[94]​ y Stölzel (BWV 200),[95]​ y realizó la revisión final de muchas de sus propias composiciones anteriores, como las Pasiones según San Mateo y San Juan y los Dieciocho grandes preludios corales.[96]​ Asimismo programó y adaptó música de compositores de una generación más joven, tales como Pergolesi (BWV 1083)[97]​ y sus propios estudiantes como Goldberg (BNB I/G/2).[98]​\n\nEn 1747, Bach entró en la Correspondierende Societät der musicalischen Wissenschaften de Lorenz Christoph Mizler después de una larga preparación formal, necesaria para acceder a la Sociedad. Mizler llamaba a su antiguo profesor uno de sus «guten Freunde und Gönner» («buenos amigos y patrocinadores»).[99]​[100]​ Esto es particularmente notable porque Mizler era un apasionado representante de la Ilustración alemana y polaca.[101]​ Su afiliación tuvo varios efectos. Con ocasión de su entrada en la Sociedad, compuso las Variaciones canónicas sobre \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\", BWV 769.[102]​ En 1746, durante la preparación de la entrada del compositor, Elias Gottlob Haussmann pintó el famoso retrato de Bach. Se tenía que enviar un retrato a cada miembro de la Sociedad.[d]​ Bach dedicó por este retrato el Canon triplex a 6 (BWV 1076) a la Sociedad.[103]​ La Sociedad insistió en realizar un obituario de cada miembro, por lo que Mizler inició la historia de las biografías de Bach en la Musikalische Bibliothek.[104]​\n\nEse mismo año, Bach visitó la corte de Federico II el Grande en el palacio de Sanssouci (Potsdam), donde uno de sus hijos, Carl Philipp Emanuel, estaba al servicio del monarca como clavecinista de la corte. El rey interpretó un tema para él y lo desafió a improvisar una fuga basada en este. El compositor improvisó una fuga en tres partes en el pianoforte del monarca, entonces una novedad, y posteriormente presentó al rey Federico la Ofrenda musical, que consistía en fugas, cánones y un trío basado en ese Thema Regium. Su fuga en seis partes incluye un tema ligeramente alterado, más adecuado para una extensa elaboración. Las Corales Schübler, un conjunto de seis preludios corales transcritos de movimientos de cantatas que Bach había compuesto unas dos décadas antes, se publicaron al año siguiente.[105]​[106]​ Casi al mismo tiempo se imprimió también el conjunto de cinco variaciones canónicas que Bach había presentado al ingresar a la sociedad de Mizler en 1747.[107]​\n\nA menudo se ha argumentado que otras obras tardías del compositor pudieron tener conexión con la teoría musical basada en la Sociedad. Dos composiciones a gran escala ocuparon un lugar central en los últimos años de Bach. Desde alrededor de 1742 escribió y revisó los diversos cánones y fugas de El arte de la fuga, que continuó preparando para su publicación hasta poco antes de morir. Bach no pudo completar su fuga final.[108]​ ​ Consiste en 18 fugas y cánones complejos basados en un tema simple y fue publicada a título póstumo en 1751.[110]​ Después de extraer una cantata, Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191, de su Misa Kyrie-Gloria de 1733 para la corte de Dresde a mediados de la década de 1740, amplió ese escenario a su misa en si menor en los últimos años de su vida. Stauffer la describe como «la obra eclesiástica más universal de Bach. Consiste principalmente en movimientos reciclados de cantatas escritas durante un período de treinta y cinco años, que le permitió examinar sus piezas vocales por última vez y elegir movimientos selectos para su posterior revisión y refinamiento».[19]​ Aunque la misa completa nunca se representó eb vida del compositor, se considera una de las mejores obras corales de la historia.[83]​\n\nEn enero de 1749, la hija del compositor, Elisabeth Juliane Friederica, se casó con su alumno Johann Christoph Altnickol. La salud de Bach empeoró. El 2 de junio, Heinrich von Brühl escribió a uno de los burgomaestres de Leipzig para pedirle que su director de música, Gottlob Harrer, ocupara los cargos de Thomaskantor y director musical «ante el eventual [...] fallecimiento del señor Bach». ​ Se fue quedando progresivamente más ciego, por lo que el cirujano británico John Taylor lo operó durante su visita a Leipzig en marzo y de nuevo en abril de 1750.[112]​\n\nLa última obra de Bach completada fue un preludio coral para órgano, titulado Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiermit, BWV 668a, que dedicó a su yerno Johann Christoph Altnickol, desde su lecho de muerte. En las notas de los tres pentagramas de la cadencia final, leídas según la denominación germana, se encuentran las iniciales «JSB». ​\n\nEl 28 de julio de 1750, Johann Sebastian Bach falleció a la edad de 65 años.[13]​ Un periódico de la época informó de que «las infelices consecuencias de su muy poco exitosa operación» fueron la causa de su muerte. ​ Historiadores modernos especulan con que la causa de su muerte fue una apoplejía, complicada por una neumonía.[115]​[116]​[117]​ Actualmente se cree que su ceguera fue originada por una diabetes sin tratar.[118]​ Según ciertos médicos, padecía de blefaritis, enfermedad ocular visible en los retratos de sus últimos años.\n\nEl hijo del compositor Carl Philipp Emanuel se ocupó de que El arte de la fuga, aún sin terminar, se publicara en 1751.[119]​ Junto con uno de los antiguos alumnos del compositor, Johann Friedrich Agricola, el hijo también escribió el obituario («Nekrolog»), que se publicó en la Musikalische Bibliothek de Mizler en 1754.[120]​\n\nUn inventario elaborado unos meses después de que falleciera Bach muestra que su patrimonio incluía cinco clavecines, dos laúdes-clave, tres violines, tres violas, dos violonchelos, una viola da gamba, un laúd, una espineta y cincuenta y dos «libros sagrados», entre ellos obras de Martín Lutero y Flavio Josefo. ​ Fue enterrado en el viejo cementerio de San Juan en Leipzig. Su tumba estuvo sin identificar durante casi ciento cincuenta años hasta que, en 1894, se encontró finalmente su ataúd y lo trasladaron a una cripta en la iglesia de San Juan. Este edificio quedó destruido durante un bombardeo de los Aliados durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, por lo que los restos de Johann Sebastian Bach reposan desde 1950 en una tumba en la iglesia de Santo Tomás de Leipzig.[13]​\n\nLa obra de Bach se puede dividir en tres grandes períodos bien diferenciados, marcados por las influencias y la asimilación de los estilos de su época, el desarrollo, la búsqueda y evolución de su estilo personal, y los puestos profesionales que desempeñó. ​\n\nEl primer período, el de aprendizaje y estudio, va desde 1700 hasta 1713, estando ya en Weimar; en él escribió música para teclado y cantatas sacras, y formó su estilo, que sintetizaba toda la tradición de la música clásica europea precedente: la polifonía clásica fijada en tiempos de Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina; el primer Barroco de Girolamo Frescobaldi; la música francesa del siglo XVII y la de autores alemanes e italianos de su época, como Dietrich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel y Antonio Vivaldi. ​ De este último copió y adaptó obras desde su juventud: así lo hizo en Weimar, cuando, gracias al duque, pudo versionar algunas de sus obras en sus Conciertos BWV 592-597 y BWV 972-987.[123]​ Bach también se interesaba en compositores contemporáneos, a quienes estudiaba y con muchos de los cuales mantuvo una relación personal directa. Entre ellos se encontraban Jan Dismas Zelenka, Johann Mattheson, Georg Philipp Telemann, Reinhard Keiser y Georg Friedrich Händel. ​\n\nEl segundo período, ya de plena madurez, empieza en 1713 en Weimar y acaba en 1740, afincado ya en Leipzig. Bach dominaba los dos estilos principales de su época, el francés y el italiano (progresiones armónicas) ya plenamente tonales, claridad melódica y dinamismo rítmico, y, de hecho, su producción estuvo muy influida por el concierto italiano y la suite francesa. ​ Sintetizó en sus obras elementos de ambos junto a rasgos autóctonos alemanes, como el complejo contrapunto y textura interna y el coral, del que hace amplio uso en sus obras religiosas. Resulta de todo ello un estilo fácilmente reconocible, moderno, pero de claras raíces en el pasado.[123]​ En Leipzig y Köthen, ya forjado su estilo personal, adquiere un profundo dominio técnico. ​ Es así como utilizó ampliamente la técnica y las formas alemanas del órgano (tocatas, preludios, fugas, corales), las francesas del clave (suites, oberturas) y las italianas del violín (conciertos, sonatas, sinfonías).[123]​\n\nEl último período de su música va desde la publicación de Clavier-Übung III, en 1739 hasta su muerte en 1750. En esta etapa compuso el El arte de la fuga. Durante los últimos años de su vida —dominados ya en Alemania por la estética de la Ilustración— su obra era considerada anticuada, árida, difícil y saturada de adornos. En este período escribió obras instrumentales singularmente densas, como haría más adelante Beethoven, y su estilo personal se volvió más contrapuntístico, con apenas una leve influencia de la nueva música galante o estilo preclásico naciente en aquellos momentos, que se caracterizaba por su carácter homofónico y apenas utilizaba el cargado contrapunto que Bach usaba. ​ Así, el 14 de mayo de 1737, Johann Adolph Scheibe, crítico musical de la nueva mentalidad ilustrada, criticó duramente su música en Der Critischer Musikus: «sus piezas son extremadamente difíciles de tocar, pues exige que los cantantes e instrumentistas hagan con sus gargantas e instrumentos exactamente lo que él puede tocar en el clavecín».[125]​\n\nEscribió en casi todos los géneros y formas de su época, en multitud de combinaciones instrumentales y vocales. Culminó y realizó obras destacables en todos ellos e incluso creó géneros nuevos, como la sonata para teclado y un instrumento.[123]​ La única excepción fue la ópera, ​ género para el cual no compuso, aunque el lenguaje e influencia de la ópera seria del siglo XVIII está presente en toda su producción vocal.[123]​ La influencia de la ópera se plasma, sin embargo, especialmente en las cantatas, pasiones y oratorios. Schweigt stille, plaudert nicht, BWV 211 (conocida como Cantata del café) de 1735 es, prácticamente, una pequeña ópera sin representación escénica, y sus pasiones (como la Pasión según San Mateo, BWV 244, de 1727) contienen muchos elementos operísticos.\n\nDespués de Bach, algunas formas musicales, como las pasiones, las cantatas sacras, las tocatas y las fugas, fueron cayendo en desuso para los grandes compositores.[126]​ Tras su muerte, la música tomó una rumbo en el que su obra no tenía cabida; él es el punto final respecto a una forma de entender la música que se remontaba a la Edad Media, cuando tenían más importancia la polifonía que la armonía o el timbre. Pero también fue innovador y abrió caminos para la música del futuro: por ejemplo, fue el primer gran maestro del concierto para teclado. De hecho, el quinto Concierto de Brandeburgo n.º 5, BWV 1050 (1719), en el cual el teclado adquiere un papel solista que hasta entonces nunca había tenido, puede considerarse el primer concierto escrito para teclado, que continuó en la serie de conciertos BWV 1052-1065 (1735).[127]​[128]​ En ese sentido, Bach desempeñó un papel destacado en el desarrollo de dicho género. ​\n\nEn 1950, Wolfgang Schmieder elaboró el registro o catálogo de sus obras, que abarca en total 1128 obras. Se conoce por las siglas «BWV», que significan «Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis» o «Catálogo de las obras de Bach». Es un sistema de numeración usado para identificar las obras del compositor alemán, que se agrupan en dos grandes secciones.[130]​[131]​\n\nPrimera, la música vocal (BWV 1-524), que comprende cantatas (BWV 1-224); obras corales a gran escala (BWV 225-249), incluyendo pasiones (BWV 250-524), oratorios y corales, y otras obras sacras.[130]​[131]​\n\nDespués la música instrumental (BWV 525-1127), que abarca obras para órgano (BWV 525-748), otras obras para teclado (BWV 772-994), música para laúd (BWV 995-1000), música de cámara (BWV 1001-40), música orquestal (BWV 1041-71) y cánones y fugas (BWV 1072-1126), además de otro tipo de música instrumental, como conciertos (varios para un único solista y otros con hasta cuatro solistas), sonatas, suites, oberturas, preludios, fantasías, ricercares, variaciones y pasacalles. A su vez, dentro de cada una de estas dos divisiones, las obras se agrupan por géneros, y no por fecha de composición.[130]​[131]​ Por esta razón, un número BWV menor no indica una obra cronológicamente temprana.[132]​ La primera edición del catálogo listaba 1080 composiciones supervivientes indiscutidamente compuestas por Bach.[133]​ También existe un catálogo elaborado por Christoph Wolff, de menor difusión.\n\nLa música vocal de Bach que se conserva consta de 525 obras, aunque solo 482 de ellas están completas. ​ En su mayoría es sacra —solo 24 cantatas, cuatro lieder y un quodlibet son profanos— y compuesta para la liturgia de la Iglesia luterana alemana, en la que la música ocupa un importante lugar.[135]​\n\nLa gran mayoría de su música vocal la compuso en Leipzig entre los años 1723 y 1741, cuando Bach era Kantor y tenía entre sus obligaciones componer cantatas, pasiones y motetes para las cinco iglesias más grandes de la ciudad, además de para actos civiles y religiosos, como por ejemplo funerales.[136]​\n\nEl compositor diferenciaba escasamente en estilo sus obras profanas frente a las religiosas. Un ejemplo de ello es la utilización de los mismos textos para la música sacra y la profana, como sucede con la música del «Hosanna» de la Misa en si menor, BWV 232, que antes había empleado en una cantata en homenaje a Augusto II de Polonia con motivo de una de sus visitas oficiales a Leipzig, Es lebe der König, der Vater im Lande, BWV Anh. 11. ​\n\nDe su música instrumental se conservan 227 piezas para órgano, 189 piezas para clavicémbalo, 20 para instrumentos a solo, 16 de cámara, 30 orquestales y 18 especulativas. En total, son 494 las obras instrumentales completas. Están compuestas para una amplia gama de instrumentos de su época, incluso algunos experimentales, como el laúd-clave, aunque especialmente significativos son el órgano, el clavecín y el violín. ​\n\nDe su música instrumental solo los corales para órgano están destinados a su uso en la iglesia. Mucha de ella, especialmente la destinada al teclado, es de carácter didáctico, con frecuencia escritas para el aprendizaje de su hijo Wilhelm Friedemann. Entre las didácticas destacan El clave bien temperado y las series de Suites inglesas y francesas. ​\n\nEl órgano y el clavecín ocupan un papel central en la obra de Bach con más de 400 obras destinadas a ellos, aparte de ser el sostén como bajo continuo de las obras orquestales, las cantatas, las misas, las pasiones y algunas obras de cámara (que solía dirigir desde el teclado). El clavecín adquiere un papel importante como solista en los conciertos para cuerdas y uno, dos, tres o cuatro teclados. ​\n\nSu aporte a la literatura musical, avances técnicos y de interpretación, evolución e historia de estos dos instrumentos fue capital, ya que explotó al límite sus capacidades, investigó y mejoró su afinación, recursos y ejecución, y exploró las 24 tonalidades mayores y menores en El clave bien temperado, BWV 846-893. ​[142]​ Entre sus obras didácticas para clave están las Invenciones a dos voces y las Sinfonías a tres voces.[143]​\n\nEntre la música organística de Bach destacan también sus preludios corales, unos 170 aproximadamente.[13]​ La antología Orgelbüchlein (Pequeño libro para órgano), que él mismo recopiló en Weimar y en Köthen, comprende breves preludios corales, que muchas veces destinaba a fines educativos. De hecho, tras el título de la Orgelbüchlein dice que este «pequeño libro para órgano, por medio del cual un principiante del órgano recibe instrucciones para desarrollar un coral de formas muy diferentes, y al mismo tiempo adquiere facilidad en el estudio del pedaleo, ya que los corales contenidos en él tratan al pedaleo como un obbligato (es decir, esencial, no optativo)». ​\n\nDurante su estancia en Leipzig compiló tres antologías corales para órgano: los seis Corales Schübler, que son transcripciones de movimientos de cantata, y dieciocho corales, que revisó entre 1747 y 1749 y que fueron compuestos en épocas anteriores. Todos ellos incluyen composiciones para órgano, como variaciones, fugas, fantasías, tríos y diversos preludios corales. ​ ​\n\nBach conocía bien los instrumentos de cuerda, base de la orquesta barroca —cuya música solía escribirse para dos grupos de violines, uno de violas y un bajo continuo que solía incluir violonchelo y contrabajo—. Escribió repertorio para violín solista (sonatas y partitas) y violonchelo (suites), aún hoy plenamente vigentes y de alta dificultad técnica.[147]​ Escribió sonatas para un instrumento en solitario, como la viola de gamba, acompañado de clavecín o continuo, así como sonatas trío (dos instrumentos y continuo).\n\nBach escribió para instrumentos individuales, dúos y conjuntos pequeños. La Ofrenda musical y El arte de la fuga son obras contrapuntistas tardías que contienen piezas para combinaciones de instrumentos no especificados. El arte de la fuga es una obra que se corresponde muy bien con la concepción contemporánea de la música y por ello ha pasado de ser interpretada por conjuntos barrocos, hoy día todos con instrumentos de época, a ser una parte del repertorio de los principales cuartetos de cuerda.[148]​ También se interpreta frecuentemente al piano, donde puede apreciarse el carácter trascendente de la composición.[149]​\n\nLas obras sobrevivientes en la forma de concierto incluyen dos Conciertos para violín (BWV 1041 y BWV 1042) y un Concierto para dos violines, BWV 1043, a menudo denominado concierto «doble» de Bach. Este concierto tiene la particularidad de que la parte del segundo violín es más virtuosística que la del primer solista, lo que hace que los grandes solistas no tengan inconveniente en colaborar y quizá ha contribuido a su popularidad entre el público.[150]​\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach encabezó una familia numerosa con un total de veinte hijos, nacidos entre sus 23 y sus 57 años. Tuvo siete hijos de su primer matrimonio, de los cuales sobrevivieron cuatro, y trece del segundo, de los cuales sobrevivieron solo cinco. Su primera esposa fue su prima segunda, Maria Barbara Bach (1684-1720), con la que se casó en 1707. Su segunda esposa fue la cantante Anna Magdalena Wilcke (1701-1760), con la que contrajo matrimonio en 1721. ​\n\nCinco de los hijos se dedicaron a la música, aunque uno de ellos (Johann Gottfried Bernhard) abandonó su carrera y murió prematuramente a los 24 años. Los otros cuatro llegaron a convertirse en compositores e intérpretes reputados por derecho propio: ​ Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel (de quien Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart tenía muy buena opinión),[e]​ Johann Christoph Friedrich y Johann Christian, epígono de la época preclásica y una de las influencias principales del propio Mozart.[153]​ Carl Philipp Emanuel y Johann Christian llegaron a ser más famosos en su época de lo que había sido su padre.[154]​\n\nA la muerte del compositor, su familia dividió su legado musical. Wilhelm Friedemann perdió o vendió para saldar deudas varias obras compuestas por su padre. En cambio, Carl Phillip Emanuel conservó una buena parte de ellas. ​\n\nBach tuvo numerosos alumnos y estudiantes a lo largo de su vida; según el estudioso Hans Löffler, más de ochenta. Entre ellos se cuenta Johann Christoph Altnickol, yerno suyo, que en los últimos años del maestro fue copista de sus obras, además de ayudarlo en la redacción de sus últimas composiciones, como en el caso de uno de sus últimos corales para órgano, el BWV 668, el último coral del Ciclo de Leipzig BWV 651-668.[157]​\n\nYa en su vejez, cuando la gente se refería al apellido Bach lo hacía pensando en su famoso hijo Carl Phillip Emanuel. En las generaciones posteriores al compositor, solo algunos compositores y músicos conocían su obra. Básicamente eran sus hijos y sus alumnos. Gracias a ellos se conservó y no cayó en el olvido, mientras que el resto del mundo no tardaría muchos años en olvidarlo después de su muerte, en plena mitad del siglo XVIII. ​\n\nLorenz Christoph Mizler, un antiguo alumno, publicó un detallado obituario de Bach en 1754, cuatro años después de su muerte, en Musikalische Bibliothek, un periódico musical. El obituario sigue siendo probablemente «la más rica y confiable» de las primeras fuentes documentales sobre el compositor. ​ Después de su muerte, la reputación de Bach como compositor declinó en un primer momento. Su obra se consideraba pasada de moda en comparación con el emergente estilo galante.[159]​ Inicialmente, era más recordado como intérprete y profesor.\n\nLa falta de material impreso impidió una mayor difusión de su obra. Solo se publicaron tiradas muy reducidas de algunas obras instrumentales para órgano y clave. ​ Muchas de sus obras fueron compuestas para eventos determinados; por lo tanto, las interpretaron solamente una o dos veces y no se le ocurría que podría interesarle a alguien escucharlas otra vez. Por eso no se preocupaba por publicarlas.\n\nDe la única pieza que existían muchas copias manuscritas era de El clave bien temperado. Incluso Beethoven tenía una copia a los once años. Mozart lo conocía por haber escuchado hablar de su obra, pero nunca había visto nada suyo impreso. Una vez que escuchó un coro que lo cantaba quedó tan impresionado que pidió ver sus partituras, pero estas no existían.[160]​\n\nEn 1844, se hizo la primera interpretación moderna del Oratorio de Navidad, BWV 248. ​ En 1911, se halló una cantata inédita que se cataloga como Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut, BWV 199. ​ En 1924, se descubrió un fragmento de cantata, catalogada como Bekennen will ich seinen Namen, BWV 200. ​ En 1985, se encontró un manuscrito en Halle que contenía los corales BWV 1090-1120, inéditos hasta entonces. ​ En 2005, se halló un manuscrito que contiene un aria vocal Alles mit Gott und nichts ohn' ihn, BWV 1127.[164]​\n\nEn 2008, se hace en Berlín una reconstrucción moderna de su cabeza y rostro con técnicas de modelación por ordenador, dando una imagen de fidelidad muy aproximada a la real.[165]​ Ese mismo año se encontró un manuscrito que contenía un coral para órgano inédito hasta la fecha.[166]​\n\nA finales del siglo XVIII y comienzos del XIX, Bach era ampliamente reconocido por su obra para teclado. Músicos célebres, como Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann o Frédéric Chopin estaban entre sus más destacados admiradores y tuvieron un gran aprecio por las obras que conocieron de Bach; comenzaron escribiendo en un estilo más contrapuntístico después de conocer su música.[167]​ Mozart, tras haber escuchado el motete Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225 durante una visita a Leipzig, solicitó examinar cuanto allí había del compositor, exclamando «¡Al fin algo de lo que se puede aprender!».[168]​ Beethoven, sin conocer la totalidad de su obra, lo describió como el «Urvater der Harmonie» («Padre original de la armonía»).[169]​ También lo definió con un juego de palabras en alemán: «Nicht Bach, sondern Meer sollte er heissen», cuya traducción es «No debiera llamarse Bach ('arroyo', en alemán), sino Meer ('mar')».[170]​\n\nLa reputación de Bach entre el público en general mejoró en parte gracias a la biografía del compositor que realizó Johann Nikolaus Forkel en 1802.[171]​ Felix Mendelssohn contribuyó de manera significativa en la recuperación de la reputación de Bach con su representación de la Pasión según San Mateo el 11 de marzo de 1829 en Berlín. ​ Este hecho es destacado, ya que se trataba de música muy antigua para su época. En la actualidad, se acostumbra interpretar obras de otros siglos, mientras que en el período romántico no era habitual. ​ En 1850, se fundó la Bach Gesellschaft (Sociedad Bach) para promover las obras del compositor; en 1899, la Sociedad publicó una edición completa de las obras del compositor con poca intervención editorial. ​ En 1838, se reinterpretaron por primera vez las Suites para orquesta. ​ En 1900, se fundó la Neue Bachgesellschaft, una vez que la antigua sociedad cumplió su meta. ​\n\nDurante el siglo XX, el proceso de reconocimiento tanto musical como del valor pedagógico de algunas de sus obras continuó, quizás más notablemente en la promoción de sus Suites para violonchelo solo por parte de Pau Casals, el primer artista importante que grabó dichas suites.[174]​[g]​ Otra novedad ha sido el crecimiento del movimiento «auténtico» o «interpretación historicista», que intenta presentar la música como la entendía el compositor originalmente. Como ejemplos, se incluyen la interpretación de las obras para teclado con un clave en lugar de con un piano moderno, el uso de pequeños coros o voces solistas en lugar de grandes elencos al estilo de los preferidos por los intérpretes en el siglo XIX y comienzos del XX,[176]​ como también las grabaciones de la música integral de órgano en instrumentos del periodo barroco que realizó Marie-Claire Alain, quien también se dedicó a estudiar en profundidad la obra de Bach para interpretarla con los estándares barrocos de su tiempo.[177]​\n\nSu música sirvió de influencia para muchos compositores del siglo XX, entre ellos Astor Piazzolla, quien empleó el contrapunto y la fuga,[178]​ o Brian Wilson (de The Beach Boys), que se inspiró en la música coral de Bach para componer Pet Sounds (1966), un álbum caratulado de pop barroco.[179]​\n\nSegún Christoph Wolff, «Bach ahora asume un lugar en la música comparable con el de Shakespeare en la literatura o Rafael y Miguel Ángel (en Alemania también Durero) en las bellas artes». ​\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach es uno de los compositores más conocidos de la música barroca. Se ha utilizado su imagen en diversos formatos artísticos y de otra índole, como pósteres, caricaturas y postales.[181]​ Se han emitido sellos postales y otros documentos filatélicos y numismáticos en numerosos países del mundo, en muchos casos para conmemorar los aniversarios de su nacimiento y muerte.[182]​ También se han acuñado monedas, medallas y medallones conmemorativos.[183]​\n\nAparece asimismo en diversos artículos de merchandising, como relojes,[184]​ objetos para fumar (como pipas, vitolas de puro o cajetillas de tabaco),[185]​ tazas y jarras,[186]​ muñecos de juguete,[187]​ o caramelos y chocolatinas.[188]​\n\nEn Alemania, durante el siglo XX, se nombraron muchas calles en su honor. Además, se erigieron estatuas y placas conmemorativas en diversos países del mundo, incluidos Alemania, Bélgica, Canadá, China, Finlandia, Francia, Países Bajos, Irlanda, España, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos.[189]​ También se han realizado bustos y estatuillas con su imagen[190]​ y aparece en las vidrieras de varias iglesias.\n\nSu música ha sido incluida tres veces —más que ningún otro compositor— en el Disco de oro de las Voyager, una grabación fonográfica que contiene un amplio conjunto de imágenes, sonidos comunes, lenguajes y música de la Tierra, enviada al espacio exterior con las sondas espaciales Voyager.[191]​\n\nEl asteroide (1814) Bach, descubierto el 9 de octubre de 1931 por Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth, recibe su nombre en honor al compositor.[192]​ Así mismo, el cráter de impacto en el planeta Mercurio denominado «cráter Bach» también lleva su nombre. En la Antártida, se encuentra la barrera de hielo Bach, una plataforma de hielo que recibe su nombre por él.[193]​\n\nEn su condición de autor de música religiosa, su nombre figura entre las celebraciones del Calendario de Santos Luterano y comparte fecha con Georg Friedrich Händel y Heinrich Schütz. Además, se le honra con un día festivo del Calendario de Santos de la iglesia episcopal. Se celebra el 28 de julio y lo comparte con Händel y Henry Purcell. Bach y Händel también se conmemoran en el calendario de los santos preparado por la Order of Saint Luke para uso de la Iglesia metodista unida.[194]​\n\nEn 1985, cuando se cumplieron 300 años de su nacimiento, se editó el primer registro completo de todas las cantatas sacras, dirigido por Helmuth Rilling. La edición constaba de 69 cedés y fue realizada por el sello discográfico alemán Hänssler. ​ En 1989, se terminó el ciclo comenzado en 1971 de la grabación de cantatas realizado por Gustav Leonhardt y Nikolaus Harnoncourt y se editó en 60 cedés del sello discográfico Teldec. Esta grabación fue revolucionaria, pues se aplicó la concepción histórica de la interpretación y se cambió ésta para siempre. ​ En 2000, se celebraron los 250 años de su muerte y tres sellos discográficos (Brilliant, Hänssler y Teldec) publicaron ediciones conmemorativas con toda la música grabada del compositor alemán, en 155, 172 y 160 cedés, respectivamente. Además, durante ese año se celebraron innumerables actos de toda índole dedicados al estudio y divulgación del artista y su obra, especialmente en su Alemania natal.[196]​\n\nSe ha mostrado al compositor biográficamente en numerosas ocasiones en el cine, en el teatro y en la televisión, como por ejemplo: Crónicas de Ana Magdalena Bach (1968), de Jean Marie Straub y Danièle Huillet,[197]​ Johann Sebastian Bachs vergebliche Reise in den Ruhm (1980) de Victor Vicas,[198]​ Johann Sebastian Bach (1983) de Lothar Bellag,[199]​ Ein Denkmal für Johann Sebastian (1984) de Peter Milinski,[200]​ Mi nombre es Bach (2003) de Dominique de Rivaz[201]​ y El silencio antes de Bach (2007) de Pere Portabella.[202]​ Además, se ha usado su música en más de 1500 películas y programas de televisión.[203]​\n• Partituras libres de Johann Sebastian Bach en el Proyecto Biblioteca Internacional de Partituras Musicales (IMSLP).\n• Obra completa de Johann Sebastian Bach en formato midi, mp3 y pdf\n• Compendio de las cantatas de Bach"}

He began acting in television before transitioning into a leading man in films. His accolades include a Primetime Emmy Award and three Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for two Academy Awards, a British Academy Film Award, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards.\n\nTravolta came to prominence starring in the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–1979), followed by leading roles in Carrie (1976), Grease (1978), Urban Cowboy (1980), and Blow Out (1981). He earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles in Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Pulp Fiction (1994). His other notable films include Get Shorty (1995), Broken Arrow (1996), Michael (1996), Face/Off (1997), A Civil Action (1998), Primary Colors (1998), The General's Daughter (1999), The Punisher (2004), Wild Hogs (2007), Hairspray (2007), Bolt (2008), and Savages (2012).\n\nTravolta returned to television portraying lawyer Robert Shapiro in the series The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story. He received an Emmy Award as a producer as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie. He was also Emmy-nominated for his role in the action-comedy web series Die Hart (2021).\n\nOutside of acting, Travolta has released nine albums, including four singles that have charted on the Billboard Hot 100's Top 40. His albums have typically accompanied films he has starred in, such as Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture (1978), which topped the Billboard 200. Travolta is also a private pilot.[2]\n\nThe youngest of six children,[3] Travolta was born and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, an inner-ring suburb of New York City in Bergen County, New Jersey.\n\nHis father, Salvatore \"Sam\" Travolta, was a semiprofessional American football player turned tire salesman and partner in a tire company, Travolta Tire Exchange.[4] His mother, Helen Cecilia (née Burke), was an actress and singer who had appeared in The Sunshine Sisters, a radio vocal group, and acted and directed before becoming a high school drama and English teacher.[5] His siblings Joey, Ellen, Ann, Margaret, and Sam Travolta were all inspired by their mother's love of theater and drama and became actors.[5] His father was a second-generation Italian American with roots in Godrano, Sicily, and his mother was Irish American.[6][7]\n\nHe grew up in an Irish-American neighborhood and said that his household was predominantly Irish in culture.[8][9] He was raised Catholic, but later converted to Scientology in 1975 at age 21.[7][10] He converted after being given the book Dianetics from former actress Joan Prather.[11] Travolta attended Dwight Morrow High School, but dropped out as a junior at age 17 in 1971.[12]\n\nAfter dropping out of school, Travolta moved across the Hudson River to New York City and landed a role in the touring company of the musical Grease as Doody and on Broadway in Over Here!, singing the Sherman Brothers' song \"Dream Drummin'\".[13][14] He then moved to Los Angeles for professional reasons. Travolta's first screen role in California was as a fall victim in Emergency! (Season 2, Episode 2) in September 1972,[15] but his first significant movie role was as Billy Nolan, a bully who was goaded into playing a prank on Sissy Spacek's character in the horror film Carrie (1976) directed by Brian de Palma.[16] Around that time, he landed his star-making role as Vinnie Barbarino in the ABC TV sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–1979), in which his sister, Ellen, also occasionally appeared (as Arnold Horshack's mother).[17]\n\nTravolta had a hit single titled \"Let Her In\", peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in July 1976.[18][19][20] In the next few years, he starred in the television movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble and two of his most noted screen roles: Tony Manero in the dance drama Saturday Night Fever (1977) and Danny Zuko in the musical Grease (1978).[5] The films were among the most commercially successful pictures of the decade and catapulted Travolta to international stardom.[21] Saturday Night Fever earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor,[22] making him, at age 24, one of the youngest performers ever nominated for the Best Actor Oscar.[23] His mother and his sister Ann appeared very briefly in Saturday Night Fever and his sister Ellen played a waitress in Grease. Travolta performed on the Grease soundtrack album.[24] After the failure of the romance Moment by Moment (1978), in which he starred with Lily Tomlin, Travolta rebounded in 1980, riding a nationwide country music craze that followed on the heels of his hit film Urban Cowboy, in which he starred with Debra Winger.[25]\n\nTravolta followed up Urban Cowboy with a starring role in Brian de Palma's 1981 film Blow Out, which was critically lauded but a box office disappointment, likely due to its bleak ending.[26] After Blow Out came a series of commercial and critical failures which sidelined Travolta's acting career. These included Two of a Kind (1983), a romantic comedy reuniting him with Olivia Newton-John, and Perfect (1985), co-starring Jamie Lee Curtis. He also starred in Staying Alive, the 1983 sequel to Saturday Night Fever, for which he trained rigorously to portray a professional dancer and lost 20 pounds (9.1 kg);[27] the film was a financial success, grossing over $65 million, though it, too, was scorned by critics.\n\nDuring that time, Travolta was offered, but declined, lead roles in what would become box-office hits, including American Gigolo[28] and An Officer and a Gentleman, both of which went to Richard Gere, as well as Splash, which went to Tom Hanks.[29] In 1989, Travolta starred with Kirstie Alley in Look Who's Talking, which grossed $297 million, making it his most successful film since Grease.\n\nTravolta subsequently starred in Look Who's Talking Too (1990) and Look Who's Talking Now (1993), but it was not until he played against type as Vincent Vega in Quentin Tarantino's hit Pulp Fiction (1994), with Samuel L. Jackson, for which he received an Academy Award nomination, that his career was revived.[5][30][31] It was Travolta's third film alongside Bruce Willis.[32] The movie shifted him back onto the A-list and he was inundated with many diverse offers. Notable roles following Pulp Fiction include a movie-buff loan shark in Get Shorty (1995), a factory worker in White Man's Burden (1995), a corrupt U.S. Air Force pilot in Broken Arrow (1996), an everyman with extraordinary powers in Phenomenon (1996), an archangel in Michael (1996), an FBI agent and terrorist in Face/Off (1997), a desperate attorney in A Civil Action (1998), a Bill Clinton–esque presidential candidate in Primary Colors (1998),[5] and a military investigator in The General's Daughter (1999).\n\nIn 2000, Travolta starred in and co-produced the science fiction film Battlefield Earth, based on the novel of the same name by L. Ron Hubbard, in which he played the villainous leading role as a leader of a group of aliens that enslaves humanity on a bleak future Earth. The film was a dream project for Travolta since the book's release in 1982, when Hubbard wrote to him to try to help make a film adaptation.[33] The film received almost universally negative reviews and did very poorly at the box office.[34] Travolta's performance in Battlefield Earth also earned him two Razzie Awards.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Travolta remained busy as an actor, starring in Swordfish (2001); Lucky Numbers (2000); Domestic Disturbance (2001); Ladder 49 (2004); Be Cool (2005); Lonely Hearts (2006); Wild Hogs (2007); the Disney animated film Bolt (2008), in which Travolta voiced the title character; The Taking of Pelham 123; and Old Dogs (both 2009).\n\nIn 2007, Travolta played Edna Turnblad in the remake of Hairspray, his first musical since Grease.[35]\n\nSince 2010, Travolta has starred mostly in action films and thrillers, such as From Paris with Love (2010) and Savages (2012). In 2016, he returned to television in the first season of the anthology series American Crime Story, titled The People v. O. J. Simpson, in which he played lawyer Robert Shapiro.[36] For his performance he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\n\nFollowing the death of his wife Kelly Preston in July 2020, Travolta hinted on his Instagram account that he would be putting his career on hold, stating \"I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don't hear from us for a while\".[37]\n\nTravolta is a pilot[2] and rated to fly Boeing 707, 737, and 747 planes.[a] He owns four aircraft. Travolta owned an ex-Qantas Boeing 707-138B (Ex-VH-EBM) which bears an old livery of Qantas, and Travolta acted as an official goodwill ambassador for the airline wherever he flew.[38] Travolta named his 707 \"Jett Clipper Ella\", in honor of his children. The \"Clipper\" in the name refers to the use of that word by Pan Am as the company's call sign[39] as well as in the names of their aircraft.[40] In 2017, Travolta donated the Boeing 707 to the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society (HARS) near Wollongong, Australia. This was expected to be flown to Australia in November 2019,[41] but was later delayed to sometime in 2020 due to condition of the aircraft.[42] Travolta planned to be on board when the aircraft was to be flown to Illawarra Regional Airport, where HARS is based, however was not allowed to fly it, because it was to be registered as an Australian aircraft.[41]\n\nOn November 24, 1992, Travolta was piloting his Gulfstream N728T at night above a solid undercast when he experienced a total electrical system failure while flying under instrument flight rules into Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event attributed to a risky decision by an air traffic controller.[43]\n\nIn 1984, Travolta was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and presented with the Golden Plate Award by Awards Council member General Chuck Yeager, USAF.[44] Travolta was inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation in 2007 and acts as the award show's official ambassador.[45]\n\nOn September 13, 2010, during the first episode of the final season of her talk show, Oprah Winfrey announced that she would be taking her entire studio audience on an eight-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Australia, with Travolta serving as pilot for the trip. He had helped Winfrey plan the trip for more than a year.[46]\n\nHe is the author of the book Propeller One-Way Night Coach, the story of a young boy's first flight.[47]\n\nHis estate in Ocala, Florida, is situated at Jumbolair Airport with its own runway and taxiway right to his house, with two outbuildings for covered access to planes.[2][48]\n\nAfter the 2010 Haiti earthquake, joining other celebrities in helping with the relief efforts, Travolta reportedly flew his Boeing 707 full of supplies, doctors, and Scientologist Volunteer Ministers into the disaster area.[49]\n\nTravolta was in a relationship with actress Diana Hyland, whom he met while filming The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976). They remained together until Hyland's death from breast cancer on March 27, 1977. In 1980, Travolta dated French actress Catherine Deneuve.[50] Travolta also had an on-again/off-again relationship with actress Marilu Henner, which ended permanently in 1985.[51] In 1988 while filming The Experts, Travolta met actress Kelly Preston, whom he married in Paris in 1991. They had three children: Jett (1992–2009), Ella Bleu (born 2000), and Benjamin (born 2010).[52] They regularly attended marriage counseling and Travolta has stated that therapy helped the marriage.[53] They lived near Ocala, Florida.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, Jett died at age sixteen while on a Christmas vacation in The Bahamas.[54][55] A Bahamian death certificate was issued, attributing the cause of death to a seizure.[56] Jett, who had a history of seizures, reportedly had Kawasaki disease since the age of two.[57][58] Travolta confirmed that Jett was autistic and had regular seizures, and immediately made his public statements while giving testimony at the trial of two defendants (a paramedic and a former Bahamas senator) who Travolta alleged tried to blackmail him with a multimillion-dollar extortion plot involving private information in connection with the death of his son Jett.[59] After a mistrial, Travolta dropped the charges and has credited his immediate family and Scientology with helping him to cope with Jett's death and move forward with his career.[60][61][62] In memory of Jett, Travolta created the Jett Travolta Foundation, a nonprofit organization to help children with special needs.[63] It has contributed to organizations such as the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, and Simon Wiesenthal Center.[64]\n\nOn July 12, 2020, Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston, died at the age of 57, at their home in Clearwater, Florida,[65] two years after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.[66] Preston had undergone treatment at different hospitals, and at the time of her death, was receiving treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.[67]\n\nIn May 2012, an anonymous masseur filed a lawsuit against Travolta, citing claims of sexual assault and battery. A lawyer for Travolta said that the allegations were \"complete fiction and fabrication\". Travolta's counsel also stated that his client would be able to prove that he was not in California on the day in question and asserted that Travolta would \"sue the attorney and Plaintiff for malicious prosecution\" after getting the case thrown out.[68] A second masseur later joined the lawsuit, making similar claims.[69][70] Both lawsuits were subsequently dropped by the complainants and dismissed without prejudice.[71]\n\nOn September 27, 2012, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Malcolm Mackey dismissed a defamation lawsuit against Travolta and his attorney Marty Singer by writer Robert Randolph because he found that a letter, written by Singer in response to allegations in a book by Randolph, was protected by free speech.[72]\n\nTravolta was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performances in Saturday Night Fever and Pulp Fiction. He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for his performance in Get Shorty and has received a total of six nominations, the most recent being in 2011. In 2014, he received the IIFA Award for Outstanding Achievement in International Cinema.[83]\n• List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees – Youngest Nominees for Best Actor in a Leading Role\n• John Travolta collected news and commentary at The New York TimesJohn Travolta: John Travolta has been honored twice with Academy Award nominations, the latest for his riveting portrayal of a philosophical hit-man in Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction.” He also received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for this highly acclaimed role and was named Best Actor by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, among other distinguished awards.\n\nTravolta garnered further praise as a Mafioso-turned-movie producer in the comedy sensation “Get Shorty,” winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. In 1998, Travolta was honored by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts with the Britanna Award: and in that same year he received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Chicago Film Festival. Travolta also won the prestigious Alan J. Pakula Award from the US Broadcast Critics Association for his performance in “A Civil Action,” based on the best-selling book and directed by Read More >>The Thin Red Line (1998 film) - Wikipedia: The Thin Red Line is a 1998 American epic war film written and directed by Terrence Malick. It is the second film adaptation of the 1962 novel by James Jones, following the 1964 film. Telling a fictionalized version of the Battle of Mount Austen, which was part of the Guadalcanal Campaign in the Pacific Theater of the Second World War, it portrays U.S. soldiers of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, played by Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Elias Koteas, and Ben Chaplin. The novel's title alludes to a line from Rudyard Kipling's poem \"Tommy\", from Barrack-Room Ballads, in which he calls Scottish foot soldiers \"the thin red line of heroes\",[3] referring to the stand of the 93rd Regiment in the Battle of Balaclava of the Crimean War.\n\nThe film marked Malick's return to filmmaking after a 20-year absence. It co-stars Adrien Brody, George Clooney, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Jared Leto, John C. Reilly, and John Travolta. Reportedly, the first assembled cut took seven months to edit and ran five hours. By the final cut, footage of performances by Bill Pullman, Lukas Haas, and Mickey Rourke had been removed (one of Rourke's scenes was included in the special features outtakes of the Criterion Blu-ray and DVD release). The film was scored by Hans Zimmer and shot by John Toll. Principal photography took place in Queensland, Australia and in the Solomon Islands.\n\n20th Century Fox released The Thin Red Line on December 25, 1998, and grossed $98 million against a $52 million budget. Critics gave it a positive reception, praising it for its philosophical depiction of war, Malick's direction, musical score, cinematography, screenplay, editing, and performances of the cast. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound. It won the Golden Bear at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival. Martin Scorsese ranked it as his second-favorite film of the 1990s. On At the Movies, Gene Siskel called it \"the finest contemporary war film I've seen.\"[4]\n\nUnited States Army Private Witt goes AWOL from his unit in 1942 to live among the carefree Melanesian natives in the South Pacific. He is found and imprisoned on a troopship by First Sergeant Welsh of his company. Witt is not allowed to rejoin his unit, and is instead punitively assigned to act as a stretcher bearer for the upcoming campaign.\n\nThe men of C Company, 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, have been brought to the island of Guadalcanal as reinforcements in the campaign to secure Henderson Field, seize the island from the Japanese, and block off their route to Australia. C Company is commanded by Capt. James Staros. As they wait in the hold of a Navy transport ship, they contemplate their lives and the upcoming invasion.\n\nThe company lands on Guadalcanal unopposed. They march into the interior of the island, and along the way encounter natives and evidence of the ongoing Japanese presence. The company soon finds its objective: Hill 210, a key enemy position.\n\nThe attack commences at dawn the next day. Charlie Company storms up the hill, but is immediately repelled by heavy machine-gun fire. One group, a squad led by Sergeant Keck, hides behind a knoll safe from enemy fire \"to await reinforcements\". When they are fired upon, Keck reaches for a grenade on his belt and accidentally pulls the pin, then throws himself back on the grenade so that he will be the only one killed by the blast. At another point, Sergeant Welsh attempts to rescue a dying soldier, only to provide him with enough morphine to put him out of his misery.\n\nLt. Col. Gordon Tall orders Staros over the field telephone to capture the bunker by frontal assault, at whatever cost. Staros balks, stating that he will not commit his men to what he sees as a suicide mission. Meanwhile, Pvt. Bell covertly scouts the summit of the hill by himself and assesses the Japanese stronghold.\n\nFurious at Staros's refusal to obey his command, Tall ventures up to Charlie Company's position, accompanied by his battalion executive officer, Captain John Gaff. When they arrive, they find that the Japanese resistance seems to have lessened, and Tall's opinion of Staros is sealed. After being advised of Bell's reconnaissance of the Japanese position, Tall suggests a small detachment of men to perform a flanking maneuver on the bunker to capture it. Among the men to volunteer for the mission are Pvts. Witt, Doll, and Bell. Captain Gaff is given command of the detachment, and they proceed up the hill toward the bunker. A fierce battle ensues, but ultimately the American forces are victorious, and the hill is captured.\n\nFor their efforts, the men are given a week's leave, though they find little joy in the respite in the fighting. While the company is bivouacked, Staros is relieved of his command by Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C. During this time, Bell receives a letter from his wife, informing him that she has fallen in love with another man and seeks a divorce. Witt, meanwhile, comes across some of the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of outsiders, and regularly quarrel with each other.\n\nThe company is sent on patrol up a river under the command of Lieutenant Band. Witt, along with Cpl. Fife, and Pvt. Coombs, scout upriver and encounter an advancing Japanese column. As they attempt to retreat, Coombs is wounded. Witt draws away the Japanese to buy time for Fife, but Witt is encircled by one of their squads. The Japanese demand Witt surrender, but he raises his rifle and is killed. His body is buried by his squadmates, including a visibly grieving Sgt. Welsh. The company soon receives a new commander, Captain Bosche. They are relieved of duty and evacuated from Guadalcanal by a waiting LCT.\n\nBeyond these numerous top-billed cast, the ensemble included appearances in smaller roles by many other well-known actors, including Kirk Acevedo, Penny Allen, Mark Boone Junior, Matt Doran, Don Harvey, Danny Hoch, Thomas Jane, Miranda Otto, Donal Logue, and Nick Stahl.\n\nLukas Haas, Bill Pullman and Mickey Rourke were also part of the film, but their scenes were ultimately cut.\n\nNew York-based producer Bobby Geisler first approached Malick in 1978 and asked him to direct a film adaptation of David Rabe's play In the Boom Boom Room. Malick declined the offer, but instead discussed the idea of a film about the life of Joseph Merrick. Once word got out about David Lynch's film of The Elephant Man, he shelved the idea. In 1988, Geisler and John Roberdeau met with Malick in Paris about writing and directing a movie based on D. M. Thomas' 1981 novel The White Hotel. Malick declined, but told them that he would be willing instead to write either an adaptation of Molière's Tartuffe, or of James Jones' The Thin Red Line. The producers chose the latter and paid Malick $250,000 to write a screenplay.[5]\n\nMalick began adapting The Thin Red Line on January 1, 1989. Five months later, the producers received his first draft, which was 300 pages long.[6] In 1990, Malick met with James Jones' widow Gloria and Jones' daughter Kaylie about adapting The Thin Red Line into a film.[7] The producers spent a lot of time talking with Malick about his vision of the film. Geisler said,\n\nMalick spent years working on other projects, including a stage production of Sansho the Bailiff and a script known as The English-Speaker, spending $2 million of the producers' money, half of which for writing.[5] According to an article in Entertainment Weekly, the producers gained Malick's confidence by \"catering to his every whim,\"[8] providing him with obscure research material, including a book titled Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, an audiotape of Kodō's Heartbeat Drummers of Japan, information on the Navajo code talkers recruited by the United States Marine Corps, making his travel plans, and helping the director and his wife Michele get a mortgage for their Paris apartment.[9]\n\nBy January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which project he would complete. They approached Malick's former agent, Mike Medavoy, who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on The Thin Red Line.[5] Medavoy had a deal with Sony Pictures and Malick began scouting locations in Panama and Costa Rica before settling on the rain forests of northern Australia.[10] In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in Queensland, because new studio chairman John Calley did not think Malick could make his movie with the proposed $52 million budget.[10] Malick traveled to Los Angeles with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. 20th Century Fox agreed to put up $39 million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars from a list of 10 who were interested.[10] Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8 million to the budget, and Phoenix Pictures added $3 million.[10]\n\nCasting for the film became a hot topic. When Sean Penn met Malick, he told him, \"Give me a dollar and tell me where to show up.\"[8] Scripts were also sent to Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Tom Cruise. In 1995, once word went out that Malick was making another movie after many years, numerous actors approached him, flooding the casting directors until they had to announce they wouldn't be accepting more requests. Some A-list actors including Brad Pitt, Al Pacino, Gary Oldman, and George Clooney offered to work for a fraction and some even offered to work for free. Bruce Willis even went as far as offering to pay for first-class tickets for the casting crew, to get a few lines for the movie. At Medavoy's home in 1995, Malick staged a reading with Martin Sheen delivering the screen directions, and Kevin Costner, Will Patton, Peter Berg, Lukas Haas, and Dermot Mulroney playing the main roles.[5] In June of that year, a five-day workshop was scheduled at Medavoy's with Pitt dropping by, and culminating with Malick putting on the soundtrack of Where Eagles Dare and playing Japanese taiko drums. Malick met with an interested Johnny Depp about the project at the Book Soup Bistro on the Sunset Strip.[5]\n\nEdward Norton flew out to Austin and met Malick, who had been impressed by the actor's screen test for Primal Fear. Matthew McConaughey reportedly took a day off filming A Time to Kill to see Malick. Others followed, including William Baldwin, Edward Burns, Josh Hartnett, Crispin Glover, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Stephen Dorff, and Leonardo DiCaprio; the last of these flew up from the Mexico set of Romeo + Juliet to meet Malick at the American Airlines lounge in the Austin airport.[9] Before the casting was finalized, Nicolas Cage had lunch with Malick in Hollywood in February 1996. Malick went off to scout locations and tried calling Cage that summer only to find out that his phone number had been disconnected. Tom Sizemore, however, was offered a more substantial role in Saving Private Ryan and, when he could not contact Malick for several days, decided to do Steven Spielberg's film instead.[9] Actors Bill Pullman, Mickey Rourke, and Lukas Haas filmed scenes for the movie but were cut from the final film due to time constraints.[11] Publicity stills of Pullman (as Sgt. MacTae, in a scene opposite Brody and Chaplin) can be seen online, Haas is pictured in the booklet of the CD soundtrack, and one of Rourke's scenes was restored for the Criterion Blu-Ray/DVD release of the film. Malick wrote a part specifically for Oldman, but the character was eventually scrapped before production began due to too many characters being in the film. He was later thanked in the credits along with Lukas, Viggo Mortensen, Sheen, Rourke, Pullman and Jason Patric.\n\nJames Caviezel, who was cast as Private Witt, credits Malick's casting of him as the turning point in his career.[12]\n\nCinematographer John Toll began talking to Malick in August 1996 several times over the phone about the film.[13] Toll met Malick in September of the same year and was asked to do the film in the beginning of 1997. Malick and Toll began location scouting in February 1997 and started principal photography in June of that year.[13]\n\nPre-production went slowly. Weeks before filming began, Malick told Geisler and Roberdeau not to show up in Australia where the film was being made, ostensibly because George Stevens Jr. would be the on-location producer supporting line producer Grant Hill.[5] Malick told them that they had upset the studio for refusing to give up above-the-title production credit to Stevens. He did not tell them that in 1996 he had a clause inserted in his contract barring the producers from the set.[8] Geisler and Roberdeau were mystified about this behavior; Geisler told Entertainment Weekly, \"I didn't think he was capable of betrayal of this magnitude.\"[8]\n\nMalick and Toll shot for 100 days in Australia using Panavision cameras and lenses, 24 days in the Solomon Islands and three days in the United States. They scouted the historic battlefields on Guadalcanal and shot footage, but health concerns over malaria limited filming to daylight hours only. Logistics were also difficult to shoot the entire film there:[13] As director of photography John Toll put it, \"It's still a bit difficult to get on and off the island, and we had some scenes that involved 200 or 300 extras. We would have had to bring everybody to Guadalcanal, and financially it just didn't make sense.\"[14] The Thin Red Line was filmed predominantly in the Daintree Rainforest and on Bramston Beach, both in north Queensland, Australia.[15] Filming also took place on Dancer Mountain, which had such rough terrain that trailers and production trucks could not make it up the hill. A base camp was set up and roads carved out of the mountain. Transporting 250 actors and 200 crew members up the hill took two hours. Filming took place in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California near Santa Catalina Island.\n\nMalick's unconventional filming techniques included shooting part of a scene during a bright, sunny morning only to finish it weeks later at sunset. He made a habit of pointing the camera away during an action sequence and focus on a parrot, a tree branch or other fauna.[7] Malick's reputation and working methods commanded great respect among the actors, with both Woody Harrelson and John Savage staying on for an extra month after they finished all of their scenes just to watch him at work.[7]\n\nBill Pullman, Lukas Haas and Mickey Rourke performed but their scenes were eventually cut. Billy Bob Thornton recorded narration that was scrapped. Martin Sheen and Viggo Mortensen participated in readthroughs of the script and are thanked in the end credits.[16] Editor Leslie Jones was on location for five months and rarely saw Malick, who left her to her own devices.[17] After principal photography wrapped, she came back with a five-hour first cut and spent seven months editing, with Thornton contributing three hours of narrative voice-over material.[8][17] It was at this point that editor Billy Weber joined and they spent 13 months in post-production and the last four months mixing the film, using four Avid machines with a fifth added at one point.[17] Malick edited the footage one reel at a time with the sound off while listening to a Green Day CD.[18] There were no preview screenings but several in-house ones, the largest for marketing executives which was attended by 15 people.[17] The editors faced the challenge of blending footage of veteran actors with less-experienced ones, integrating the many cameos, and the voice-overs. According to Jones, \"Malick removed scenes with dialogue whenever possible, with the final film varying greatly from the original concept.\"[17] Four months after principal photography, Malick invited Toll to a rough-cut screening of the film.[13] In December 1998, Toll did the first color correction at the lab prior to the film's release in North America.[13]\n\nThe editing resulted in many of the well-known cast members being on screen for only a brief period. John Travolta and George Clooney's appearances are little more than cameos, yet Clooney's name appears prominently in the marketing of the movie. The unfinished film was screened for the New York press in December 1998 and Adrien Brody attended a screening to find that his originally significant role, \"to carry the movie\", as he put it, had been reduced to two lines and approximately five minutes of screen time.[19]\n\nMalick was upset that the studio screened his unfinished version for critics and Penn ended up helping him in the editing room, shaping the final version.[8] Malick spent three more months and cut 45 additional minutes from the film. The director refused to subject his film to test screenings before delivering his final cut.[20] After Geisler and Roberdeau told their story to Vanity Fair magazine, Medavoy's attorneys declared them in breach of contract and threatened to remove their names from the film unless they agreed to do no future interviews until after the Academy Awards.[5]\n\nThe film score was composed by Hans Zimmer, with additional music from John Powell. The album was nominated for Best Dramatic Score at the 71st Academy Awards. It was Hans Zimmer's fifth Oscar nomination as a composer, but he lost out to Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful (music by Nicola Piovani). The album was released by RCA Victor and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Among the music not written by Zimmer which appears in the film is In Paradisum from Requiem by Gabriel Fauré and the opening minutes of The Unanswered Question by Charles Ives.\n\nZimmer wrote several hours of music, and an abundance of different themes, before Malick started to shoot the film. The director played the music on the set, while filming, to get himself, and the rest of the crew and actors in the right frame of mind.\n\nThe official soundtrack features tracks that were not used on the film and some tracks from the film are not found on the CD. The film features several pieces of Melanesian choral music sung by the Choir of All Saints in Honiara and the Melanesian Brotherhood in Tabalia, only one of which is featured on the soundtrack.[21] However, another soundtrack was released containing several tracks from the choirs, titled Melanesian Choirs: The Blessed Islands – Chants from the Thin Red Line, which has since gone out of circulation.[22] This album was re-released by La-La Land Records as part of a special edition in 2019.[23]\n\nThe Thin Red Line was given a limited release on December 25, 1998, in five theaters where it grossed $282,534 on its opening weekend. The film was given a wide release on January 15, 1999, in 1,528 theaters where it grossed $9.7 million during its opening weekend. The film earned $98,126,565 at the worldwide box office.[2]\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Thin Red Line holds an approval rating of 80% based on 107 reviews, and an average rating of 7.3/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"The Thin Red Line is a daringly philosophical World War II film with an enormous cast of eager stars.\"[24] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[25] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C\" on an A+ to F scale.[26]\n\nGene Siskel described The Thin Red Line as the \"finest contemporary war film I've seen, supplanting Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan from earlier this year, or even Oliver Stone's Platoon from 1986.\"[4][better source needed] A more subdued Roger Ebert gave it three stars out of four, saying that it felt confused and unfinished. He wrote, \"The movie's schizophrenia keeps it from greatness (this film has no firm idea of what it is about), but doesn't make it bad. It is, in fact, sort of fascinating... The battle scenes themselves are masterful, in creating a sense of the geography of a particular hill, the way it is defended by Japanese bunkers, the ways in which the American soldiers attempt to take it ... Actors like Sean Penn, John Cusack, Jim Caviezel and Ben Chaplin find the perfect tone for scenes of a few seconds or a minute, and then are dropped before a rhythm can be established.\"[27]\n\nIn his review for Time, Richard Corliss wrote, \"Some films deal in plot truth; this one expresses emotional truth, the heart's search for saving wisdom, in some of the most luscious imagery since Malick's last film, the 1978 Days of Heaven.\"[28] Mike Clark of USA Today gave the film four out of four stars.[29][better source needed] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post wrote, \"The Thin Red Line is a movie about creation growing out of destruction, about love where you'd least expect to find it and about angels – especially the fallen kind – who just happen to be men.\"[30]\n\nAndrew Johnston of Time Out New York wrote: \"Like Malick's previous efforts – Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978) – Line is a film of incredible beauty. However, the atmosphere created by John Toll's breathtaking cinematography and Hans Zimmer's powerful score is occasionally compromised. The parade of cameos (John Travolta, George Clooney, Woody Harrelson and John Cusack briefly appear) is somewhat distracting, and the fact that Bell and Witt both have Appalachian accents sometimes makes the characters hard to differentiate. Yet, even though it's confusing at times (and perhaps a little long), Line is still a film of rare substance and power.\"[31]\n\nOwen Gleiberman gave the film a \"B−\" in his review for Entertainment Weekly and wrote, \"The Thin Red Line could, I think, turn out to be this season's Beloved, a movie too paralyzingly high-minded to connect with audiences.\"[32] In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin called it \"intermittently brilliant\" and wrote, \"The heart-piercing moments that punctuate its rambling are glimpses of what a tighter film might have been.\"[33]\n\nIn a special episode of Siskel and Ebert, guest host Martin Scorsese selected The Thin Red Line as the second best film of the 1990s behind The Horse Thief.[34][35]\n\nTime magazine ranked Malick's film #6 on their Best of 1998 Cinema list.[59]\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum, film critic for the Chicago Reader, ranked Malick's film as his second favorite film of 1999.[60]\n\nOn September 28, 2010, The Criterion Collection released a special edition of The Thin Red Line on DVD and Blu-ray with a new, restored 4K digital transfer, supervised and approved by Terrence Malick and cinematographer John Toll.[61] The release was met with positive reviews.[62][63]\n\nVarious lines of dialogue have been sampled from the movie.[64]\n• Sampled in \"Have You Passed Through This Night?\" by post-rock band Explosions in the Sky, released in 2001.\n• Sampled in \"Eye for an Eye\" by electronic music act UNKLE, released in 2003.\n• Sampled in \"Eye for an Eye\" by electronic music act UNKLE, released in 2003.\n• Sampled in \"Red Line\" by Drum & Bass musicians Fierce and Break.\n\n\"I Feel Sorry For You Kid\"\n• Sampled in \"Taco DE Macque\" by ambient music duo The Dead Texan\n• None Schaffer, Bill (July 2000). \"The Shape of Fear: Thoughts after The Thin Red Line\".

Some of them have been in the Army more than 10 years. Some of them however have never seen real action before and this is a hot and uncomfortable location, despite the lovely tropical scenery. Some crack up, some die, some do heroic deeds. Their leaders are not particularly admirable; one is quite happy to get his men killed if he can come out of the action looking good.\n\n\n\nOut of sight for most of the film are the Melanesian inhabitants, the Solomon Islanders, who are carrying on living as best they can while the war rages around them. Their serenity is in sharp contrast to the frenetic military activity. Of course, there is nowhere for them to go.\n\n\n\nThere is some action excitingly filmed but as in real wars much of the time is spent preparing and waiting. Personal stories unfold but at the end it is survival that matters.\n\n\n\nThe lighting and photography is quite superb, the lighting in particular fitting the mood perfectly. Filming was not actually on Guadalcanal but near Port Douglas in Northern Queensland where there is similar tropical rainforest and fauna but with much easier logistics. It took ages apparently but seems more than worth the effort.\n\n\n\nThis is probably one of the four or five greatest war films ever made, right up there with \"All Quiet on the Western Front, \" \"Paths of Glory,\" \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"The Longest Day.\" Never has a movie better portrayed what it's like to be a frontline soldier.\n\n\n\nTerrence Malick has the reputation of being an eccentric, difficult director - Kubrick without the fear of flying. Yet this is not a particularly unconventional movie - it's just that everything hangs together - the story, dialogue, performances, photography and settings. On thing is clear - this is a better interpretation of James Jones' novel than the 1964 version.Amazon.com: The Thin Red Line : James Caviezel, Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, Kirk Acevedo, Penelope Allen, Adrien Brody, Benjamin Green, Simon Billig, Ben Chaplin, Mark Boone Junior, George Clooney, John Cusack, Terrence Malick, James Jones, Terrence Malick: Películas y TV: Recoger en las ubicaciones de recolección cercanas\n\nSelecciona la opción “Recolección” en la página del producto o al proceder al pago.\n\nUna vez que tu paquete esté listo para recolección, recibirás una notificación por correo electrónico y por la aplicación.\n\nLleva tu identificador de pedido o el aviso de entrega (si aplica) a la ubicación de recolección elegida para recoger tu paquete."}

The city, located 300 km (186 mi) northwest of Buenos Aires on the west bank of the Paraná River, is the third-most populous city in the country after Buenos Aires and Cordoba. With a growing and important metropolitan area, Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,750,000 as of 2020 .[5][6] One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical, Art Nouveau,[7] and Art Deco architecture that has been preserved in hundreds of residences, houses and public buildings. The city is also famous for being the birthplace of the award-winning Argentine footballer Lionel Messi.[8]\n\nRosario is the head city of the Rosario Department and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina. The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina. Ships reach the city via the Paraná River, which allows the existence of a 10-metre-deep (34 ft) port. The Port of Rosario is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically.[9] Exports include wheat, flour, hay, linseed and other vegetable oils, corn, sugar, lumber, meat, hides, and wool. Manufactured goods include flour, sugar, meat products, and other foodstuffs. The Rosario-Victoria Bridge, opened in 2004, spans the Paraná River, connecting Rosario with the city of Victoria, across the Paraná Delta. The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce, and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy.\n\nAlong with Paraná, Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that cannot point to a particular individual as its founder. The city's patron is the \"Virgin of the Rosary\", whose feast day is 7 October.\n\nEven though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof, most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants.[10] Nonetheless, the town was officially declared a city on 3 August 1852, at the time it was known as Pago de los Arroyos (\"land of the streams\"), a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe, like the Ludueña Stream, the Saladillo Stream and others, emptying into the Paraná River. In 1689, captain Luís Romero de Piñeda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree, as payment for services to the Spanish Crown. Before that, the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes, some of which lived in reducciones, a type of mission founded by Franciscans. These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the Chaco region.\n\nRomero de Piñeda established the first permanent settlement, an estancia — intended as farmland, not as a town. In 1719, the Jesuits bought another part and established Estancia San Miguel. The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority; it was ruled from the provincial capital (Santa Fe), and in turn from Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 1724, another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro, who set up a mill, drew plans for the future town, built a chapel, and was appointed mayor in 1751. The area of control of this local government extended northward from today's Rosario; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions.\n\nOn February 27, 1812, General Manuel Belgrano raised the newly created Argentine flag on the shores of the Paraná, for the first time. Because of this, Rosario is known as the \"Cradle of the Argentine Flag\". The National Flag Memorial marks the occasion.\n\nThe province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820. Demographic growth was relatively slow. During this period, Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires. In 1823, it was elevated to the category of \"village\" (Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario). Charles Darwin travelled through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as \"a large town\" with about 2,000 residents. In 1841, a decree of the caudillo and Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, banned navigation of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers to non-Argentine vessels, and thus shut off the Port of Rosario to foreign trade.\n\nOn 25 December 1851, a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival caudillo Justo José de Urquiza. As a reward for their participation in the Battle of Caseros, triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status. Governor Domingo Crespo justified the request at the provincial legislative body, marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade, and on 5 August, Rosario was formally declared a city.\n\nUrquiza opened up the river for free international trade. The city's economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate. By 1880, Rosario had become the first export outlet of Argentina. During the last 15 years of the 19th century, the city more than doubled its population, in part due to immigration. By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants, of whom 40% were European immigrants, who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a politically progressive city (contrasting with the more conservative, aristocratic Santa Fe).\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic. Ovidio Lagos, founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper, La Capital, was one of the strongest proponents of this idea (one of the main avenues in Rosario now carries his name). Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions, but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch (once by Bartolomé Mitre and twice by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento). In 1911, the French-owned railway company Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano opened a line between Rosario and Puerto Belgrano, Argentina's main naval base. By 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I.\n\nIn 1969 workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the \"Rosariazo\" against the dictatorship. A few years later, in 1976, the military dictatorship made hundreds of dissident citizens \"disappear\" in what is known as the Dirty War.\n\nIn 1983, Argentina returned to democratic rule, but in 1989, hyperinflation caused the economic collapse of the country. In Rosario there were riots and looting episodes. Under the Menem administration, the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition, and agricultural exports stagnated. In 1995, unemployment in the area reached 21.1% and a large part of Rosario's population fell below the poverty line.\n\nSince the recovery of the national economy that followed the 2001 collapse, Rosario's economic situation has improved. The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in consumer spending and investment. The Socialist Party has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman Héctor Cavallero's 1989 election. Cavallero's successor, Hermes Binner (elected in 1995), was elected Governor of Santa Fe in 2007 and became the runner-up in the 2011 presidential election on the FAP ticket. Mayor Miguel Lifschitz's administration, elected in 2007, took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in public works as well as in public health (which takes up about a quarter of the whole budget). Mayor Mónica Fein became, in 2011, the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history.[11]\n\nAfter the 1990s, Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina, headed by a drug dealing family called \"Los Monos\" (\"The Monkeys\").[12] Early during 2018, it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs (\"Los Funes\" and \"Los Camino\") was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours.[13][14]\n• on a train during an electoral campaign (1926) on a train during an electoral campaign (1926) Hipólito Yrigoyen on a train during an electoral campaign (1926)\n\nRosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a mayor (seat: Palacio de los Leones), and a legislative branch, consisting of a Deliberative Council (seat: Palacio Vassallo). The mayor is elected for a four-year term, and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years.\n\nSince 1997, a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out, materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District (Centre, North, South, West, Northwest and Southwest).\n\nThe city is divided into six large administrative districts (Center, North, Northwest, West, Southwest, and South), with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population.\n\nFor years, local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of Autonomous City. Some, with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe, Entre Ríos and Córdoba as well as other important politicians, have put forward a legislative project to move the National Congress to Rosario, to decentralize the national government.[15]\n\nSince the return to democracy in 1983, the mayors of Rosario were Horacio Usandizaga, Héctor Cavallero (standing in for Usandizaga, then re-elected), Hermes Binner (re-elected once), Miguel Lifschitz (re-elected once), and, since December 2011 to December 2019, Mónica Fein. Currently, the mayor is Pablo Javkin, whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023. From Cavallero on (1989), the mayor has been a member of the Socialist Party, since December 2019, Rosario's mayor is from a different political party, ending more than 30 years of socialism.\n\nThe city does not have a police force of its own (it is served by the provincial police), but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called Guardia Urbana Municipal (\"Municipal Urban Guard\"), which was later used as a model for Buenos Aires and other cities.\n\nThe municipality of Rosario comprises 178.69 square kilometres (69.0 sq mi), of which 117.2 km2 (45 sq mi) are urbanized, in 6,306 housing blocks. Of this area, 9.3 km2 (3.6 sq mi), 5.3% is devoted to green spaces (parks, boulevards, plazas), which gives over 10 m2 of green space per inhabitant.\n\nElectric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97% of the population (about 350,000 homes). Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes.[16]\n\nWith the recovery of the national economy since 2002, the city experienced a real-estate boom. In the period 2003–2006, the construction sector added 2 million m2, investing about $900 million. Despite this increased supply, both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s.\n\nAccording to experts, this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario, helped by competitive exports, and the overall preference for safer investment options.[17]\n\nRosario has several public health centers: five municipal hospitals (including a children's hospital and an emergency hospital/trauma center) and a municipal outpatient-only center, plus two large provincial hospitals (Hospital Provincial and Hospital Centenario), and their associated primary care centers in the city proper and its metropolitan area.\n\nRosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry, generating the second-largest urban gross regional product of Argentina, after Greater Buenos Aires.[citation needed][18] The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry, whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of Greater Rosario; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world[19] Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city. Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20% of the cars, 4% of the domestic refrigerators, 80% of the machinery for the food industry and 100% of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina.\n\nOther important sectors include the petrochemical sector, with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin; the chemistry sector, with plants for sulphuric acid, fertilizers, resins and other products; the cellulose industry; the meat industry; ironworks; auto parts; the plants and equipment for bottled oil; agricultural machinery; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry. Worldwide international companies settled in Rosario include, among others, General Motors, Cargill, Unilever, John Deere, Petrobrás, ICI, Dow, Tenneco and Mahle.\n\nThe main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the Municipal Bank of Rosario. Its central offices are located in the financial district, on San Martín St., and there are several additional offices throughout the city. It is focused on small and medium enterprises and other organizations, especially through micro credits, and may be considered an \"ethical bank.\"[20]\n\nThe Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province, centered in Rosario. At the time, the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paraná River. The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli, citing the proliferation of \"centers of usury\" that exploited those in need of credit, especially the poor (something not addressed by the profile of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe, which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons). Acting on this, the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill (on 1 February 1895) dictating an \"Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts;\" the bank opened exactly one year later.\n\nThe seat of the bank was moved in 1905. Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill. Its location was moved again, for the last time so far, in 1986. Following some political controversy, the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the Central Bank, and transformed into a joint stock company, with only 1% of the stock belonging to the municipal state. A special clause was added, dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable, to prevent hypothetical attempts at privatization.[21]\n\nThe Rosario Board of Trade mainly deals in cereals and oilseeds. The banking sector includes the state-owned Municipal Bank of Rosario, with branches and offices throughout the city, and the central branch of the New Bank of Santa Fe.\n\nThe largest technological center in Argentina – Polo Tecnológico Rosario (PTR) – is located in Rosario within La Siberia site. The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas: biotechnology, software development, and telecommunications. It currently employs 3,500 people, and it is expected to grow 100% by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America.\n\nRosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach. The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music, painting, philosophy, politics, poetry, literature, medicine, and law. Among the city's important theaters are El Círculo, Sala Lavardén, Broadway, Astengo Auditorium, and La Comedia. A cultural complex known as Puerto de la Música,[22] designed by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer (of Brasília fame), is to be built along the banks of the Paraná River. If completed, it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America. In 2012, after years without progress, it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints. January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship, held in the Parana River. Three years later, in 1998, a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion.\n\nThe city has several museums, including Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum, Dr. Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum, City Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario (MACRo). The Dr. Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006. Rosario also has a public astronomy complex, located in Urquiza Park, which consists of an observatory (inaugurated in 1970) and a planetarium (1984).\n\nThe Fundación Italia is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a \"cultural bond with Italy\". It has organized a Neapolitan music concert, performances of Madame Butterfly and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina. Among the people invited to give these talks were economists Domingo Cavallo and Alfonso Prat Gay, renowned scholars Beatriz Sarlo and Silvia Bleichmar, journalists Alejandro Rozitchner and Jorge Asís, filmmaker Fernando Solanas and former presidents of Chile (Ricardo Lagos), Argentina (Eduardo Duhalde), and Uruguay (Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera).\n\nThe Independence Hippodrome opened on December 8 of 1901, when the first ride meeting was held. The Hippodrome was located in the heart of the Parque de la Independencia and occupied a prominent place in the city's social scene. In 1919, construction began of the Popular Opinion. La Tribuna rose Partners in 1928. Moreover, it had started the construction of a new box office. In 1941, the Tribune Paddock (formerly Partners Tribune) was demolished. The final podium of professional construidaes, begun in 1972. Independence Hippodrome was the initiator in Argentina night time racing, with lighting facilities for this purpose. There's also the Jockey Club de Rosario.\n\nThe racecourse features three tracks that are used for entertainment, vacation, and skills. The Main Track has 1,794 metres (5,886 ft) of sand. This track is open on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for tests, with Sunday competitions.\n\nThe Assistant Track 1 has 1,650 m (5,413 ft) with sand, used on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays inclusive for the tournaments and some special courses such as race trot.\n\nThe Assistant Track 2 has 1,450 m (4,757 ft) of land used to jog and tame.\n• Ex-Tribune Partners: with a privileged view of the oval track and focused, this building covers 1,300 m2 (13,990 sq ft) and three levels, the second is a restaurant seating 150 people.\n• Professional-Tribune, has a covered area of 300 m2 (3,229 sq ft). On the ground floor is the technical area and the Commissariat sector.\n• Paddock-Tribune, has covered area of 900 m2 (9,688 sq ft). It has a gambling parlor and a VIP room with a buffet area for the fans. It has the office of the Administration and the boxes for journalists.\n\nThe National Flag Memorial in Rosario is a monumental complex built near the banks of the Paraná River. It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20, 1957 – the anniversary of the death of Manuel Belgrano, creator of the Argentine flag, who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27, 1812.\n\nThe complex has a total area of about 10,000 m2 (107,600 sq ft) and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes. The structure was designed by the architects Ángel Guido and Alejandro Bustillo, and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors Lola Mora, Eduardo Barnes, Alfredo Bigatti, and José Fioravanti.[25][26]\n\nThe Memorial (Monumento) has three parts: the Tower (Torre) or mast, 70 metres (230 ft) high, which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano's crypt in its base; the Civic Courtyard (Patio Cívico), which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state (the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows), and the Triumphal Propylaeum (Propileo Triunfal), representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution. Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America (where the flags of all American nations are displayed).\n\nThe complex faces Belgrano Avenue, and is delimited by Córdoba and Santa Fe Streets, the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point. The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento (\"Oath Passage\"), which starts at Buenos Aires St. between the municipal building (Palacio de los Leones) and the Cathedral, in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo (May 25 Square). Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora.\n\nThe Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20. The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex, in 2007, was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system. [27] El Puerto de la Música will be a theater with a total capacity of 30,000 people located by the Paraná River.\n\nArchitect Oscar Niemeyer came up with the concept by expanding the show from inside the theater to a much larger outside audience. The concrete curvilinear shape building with an area of 215,278 sq ft (20,000.0 m2) is the first design of Oscar Niemeyer in Argentina.[28] The project will be a distinctive part of Rosario's skyline. Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014.\n\nLocated in Urquiza Park, Rosario's Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region.\n\nThe planetarium has a core team, together with its secondary elements, providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display.\n\nThe assembly is installed in the Room \"Oscar Claudio Caprile\", located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet.\n\nFor its technical characteristics in terms of size, quality of sound and image, and interior comfort, this room is considered among the best in the world.\n\nThe building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" observatory and the experimental science museum.\n\nMunicipal Astronomical Observatory \"Prof. Victor Capolongo\" was inaugurated on June 18, 1970, and named its first director.\n\nThe Observatory facilitates outreach, teaching, and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky, such as eclipses, planetary configurations, passages of comets, etc.\n\nTo that end, the Observatory has installed two telescopes. One Coudé refractor has a 150 mm (5.9 in) aperture and 2,250 mm (88.6 in) focal distance provided with Lyot's monochromatic filter for solar observation. Another Cassegrain reflector has 300 mm (11.8 in) aperture, constructed by the Carl Zeiss company.\n\nThere are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario's sky, according to time of year and especially the Sun, the Moon, and the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, and Venus.\n\nThe asteroid 14812 Rosario was named in the city's honor as a result.[29]\n\nThis museum was inaugurated on September 24, 1987. It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums, in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature, which can be interactively used by the general public.\n\nThus, visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers, sound mixers, radios of various types, computers, solar cells, etc.\n\nTo complement this, exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology: mathematics and computer science, engineering, physics, astronomy, astronautics, geology, chemistry, and biology. In addition, an important area is intended for periodic samples, such as the Space Age, energy: renewable and rational use, from sand to glass, among others. The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office, the Municipality of Rosario, and the contributions made by institutions and individuals.\n\nThe museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science, which has an area called \"CIENCIANIÑO\" (ChildScience) for children aged 4 to 10. The museum works in the evening, similar to the Planetarium. Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments.\n\nThe 4-metre-tall bronze statue of Che Guevara was unveiled on 14 June 2008[30] to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his birth. It is made from 75,000 bronze keys donated by Argentines nationwide[30] and weighs 2.7 tons. The statue was made by artist Andrés Zerneri and is the first such monument to Guevara in his native Argentina.[31]\n\nRosario is located in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina. This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million (1,159,004 est.), thus being Argentina's third most populated urban settlement, after Córdoba.[32] Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself (population about 910,000) and a large area around it, spreading in all directions except eastward (because of the Paraná River). Directly to the south, it includes the city of Villa Gobernador Gálvez, with a population of about 75,000, about 10 km (6.2 mi) from Rosario city center.\n\nTo the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities (Funes, Roldán, Pérez, Soldini); Roldán is 23 km (14 mi) from the Rosario city centre. These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario, and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario.\n\nThe farthest end is to the north, following the coast of the river; from Rosario, one finds, in succession and usually merging into each other, the towns of Granadero Baigorria, Capitán Bermúdez, Fray Luis Beltrán, San Lorenzo (already in a different departamento, with a population of over 40,000), and Puerto General San Martín, the last being at a distance of 35 km (22 mi) from Rosario.\n\nThe north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called Cordón Industrial (\"Industrial Corridor\"), since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region. The prelude to the economic crisis in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports. These sectors were largely revitalized by 2006 as the national economy continued to recover, but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city's western neighborhoods (official surveys indicated that in 2011, 6.5% of the metro area population was under the poverty line; and that in 2012, 8.3% of the labor force was unemployed).[6][33]\n\nIn 1876 the total population was 203,509; by 1926, Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants, 47% of them foreign, many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I. Most of these were Italian, and among them, a majority from the north-western region of Liguria.\n\nAs of the 2010 Census, there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and 31 surrounding districts, making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off.[3] The population density in Rosario proper was 6,680 inhabitants per square kilometer (17,300 inhabitants/sq mi); but, only about 2,400/km2 (6,200/sq mi) in the suburbs.[34]\n\nThe 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population. With 21% under the age of fifteen and 17% over sixty, the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities. They are, likewise, more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole (of whom 25% were under 15 and 14%, over 60).[3]\n\nThe ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century, when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this the city's population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin. As Buenos Aires was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s, Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people.[citation needed] The main contributors were Spain, Italy, France, Croatia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Ukraine, the Balkans (especially Greece, Serbia and Montenegro), Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Scandinavia (especially Sweden). By the 1910s, 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked.[35][36]\n\nMost immigrants, regardless of origin, settled in the city or around Greater Rosario. However, in the first stages of immigration, some formed colonies (especially agricultural colonies) in different parts of the city, often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations.\n\nChristianity is the dominant faith with Roman Catholicism as the most practiced, followed by Protestantism. Judaism is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest Jewish communities in Argentina. There is also a local Islamic society.[37]\n\nRosario is divided into six districts, most named by location, although the easternmost is called Centre District for it includes the oldest part of the city, historically called Centro (City Centre). The data given below are from the 2001 census [INDEC].\n\nAt Rosario city center, Córdoba Street is the main avenue. It begins at the Flag Memorial Park, climbs towards the district area, and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks, between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles. Along Córdoba Ave to the west Paseo del Siglo (\"Walk of the Century\") was settled, with former houses of wealthy families, finally there is also the San Martín Square, and elsewhere, Plaza Montenegro (on Peatonal San Martín, the pedestrian-only four blocks of San Martín Street) and Plaza Sarmiento.\n\nOroño Boulevard (going north–south) and Pellegrini Avenue (east-west) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river. At their confluence starts the Parque de la Independencia, that houses the Juan B. Castagnino Fine Arts Museum, the Newell's Old Boys football club, and the sports clubs Provincial and Gimnasia y Esgrima, as well as the horse racetrack and the former Sociedad Rural (Rural Society).\n\nTowards the south, beyond Pellegrini Avenue, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez. To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main barrios in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream.\n\nAmong the districts in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy and Fisherton. To the north-east there lie Pichincha, Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of Rosario Central's stadium) and Empalme Graneros.\n\nNext to the stadium, there is the Parque Alem, and nearby the Sorrento thermal power plant. To the north lie the districts of Alberdi, La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), Parque Field (built under US President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress development plans) and Rucci. The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge and the city of Granadero Baigorria). These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\nAn important part of Rosario's urban character is its riverbank. The city recovered the riverbank of the Paraná not long ago, thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system. Going from the center immediately north of the port, the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks; Argentine flag Memorial, Parque de España, Parque de las Colectividades and Parque Sunchales.\n\nThrough the years, Rosario has spread in all directions. Towards the south, beyond Pellegrini, there are two more boulevards, 27 de Febrero and Seguí, and avenues Uriburu, Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.To the west, after Oroño, there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia, Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue. The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada, Parque Casado, Las Heras, Las Delicias and Las Flores. The city ends in the Saladillo Stream (the natural border with Villa Gobernador Gálvez). This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli.\n\nAmong the neighborhoods in the west are Echesortu, Belgrano, Triángulo, Moderno, Godoy, and Fisherton (near the west end of the city, formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario). To the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of Pichincha (a red-light district in the early 20th century, now home to an open-air antiquities fair: Mercado de antigüedades \"Feria Retro La Huella\"), Ludueña, Lisandro de la Torre (home of the Rosario Central football club) and Empalme Graneros; these last three are in the influence area of the Ludueña Stream, now contained by underground piping, but until the 1980s a source of floods.\n\nNext to the Rosario Central stadium, there is a large park, Parque Alem, and not far from it, there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric power plant. North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood, there are Alberdi (formerly an independent town), La Florida (with a popular beach resort of the same name), and Rucci.\n\nThe main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation, Rondeau Boulevard (which leads to the north exit of the city, the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, and the town of Granadero Baigorria). These major arteries are crossed by several avenues: Las Tres Vías, Génova, Sorrento, and Puccio.\n\nRosario's strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the Mercosur, the Common Market for the South.[38]\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 50 min. 9% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min, while 19% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3 km, while 4% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.[39]\n\nThe Rosario trolleybus system consists of only one main trunk line. It is presently operated by a government-owned corporation, SEMTUR (Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario, \"Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport\"), as are some of Rosario's other urban bus lines.\n\nPlaza Sarmiento is the hub of the city bus system, about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nBus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices, automatic vending machines, and private businesses. For occasional use, a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit. The interurban lines have differential fares, and some allow payment in cash only. The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards, in favor of the plastic ones, during the second half of 2012.\n\nThe urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy, since 2003, and consists of about 730 units. In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months. Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles. According to the Rosario Transportation Office, in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month,[40] by 2007, usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day (12.6 million per month).\n\nA significant number of buses run on natural gas, as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives. The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper; most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel.\n\nIn 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area.[1] Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two. For the most part, they leave room to only one additional, narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles. They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well. They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden, as well as right turns. Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount.[41]\n\nRosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet, with units painted black and outlined in yellow. Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone; others only in the streets. As the economy of Argentina recovers, the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage. In September 2005, the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units, but this requirement has not been fulfilled.\n\nRosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal,[42] (Terminal de Omnibus), across from the Patio de la Madera Convention and Exposition Centre complex, about 15 blocks west of Plaza San Martin. The transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short, medium, and long-distance travel, carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations, which comprise most major domestic cities including Puerto Iguazú, Salta and Bariloche and international destinations such as Asunción, Paraguay, Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and Montevideo, Uruguay, destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable long-distance coaches with modern conveniences.\n\nRosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French railway companies that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries, with more than 15 stations operating in the city. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised during the presidency of Juan Perón, most of the stations (by then under the administration of State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos) were closed for passenger services to reduce costs, leaving only a few active.\n\nAfter the railway privatization in the early 1990s during Carlos Menem's presidency, the passenger services were considerably reduced. The lines operated by Nuevo Central Argentino (NCA) handle most of the cargo. Additionally, two private companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities. Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA) ran weekly trains south to Retiro in Buenos Aires and north to Santa Fe. The company Ferrocentral also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to Córdoba and Tucumán.\n\nNowadays, passenger services to Rosario are being operated by state-owned company Trenes Argentinos, running trains to Rosario Norte[43] with stop in Rosario Sur.\n\nThe other station in the main district, Rosario Oeste, used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948, but currently operates for freight trains only.\n\nAs of June 2021, only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city. The following chart describes the total of existing railway stations in Rosario:\n\nThere was a project to build a high-speed train between Buenos Aires-Rosario-Córdoba, scheduled to be started in 2008, with an inauguration in 2012, that would join Rosario and Buenos Aires in 85 minutes, and would reach Córdoba in another 90 minutes at speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph).[48] However it never was constructed and the project was finally suspended after the controversy it generated among the citizens and the media critics because of the high costs it implicated.[49]\n\nThe city once had a large tramway network with 192 km of track in the centre of the city, however this was abandoned in 1963 after fierce competition from bus transport in the city.[50] The city now has two heritage tramways, one of which uses vintage trams converted to run on rubber tyres, while the other uses the original trams from the city refurbished to run on rails.[51][52][53]\n\nMore recently, a metro system was proposed for the city, though this was shelved in favour of a new urban tramway network. The network is currently in the bidding process, with large firms like Siemens and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bidding for its construction.[54] It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated Rosario Sur Station and run northwards through the city.[55]\n\nRosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads: the Aramburu Highway (southeast, to Buenos Aires), National Route 9 (from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia), the Brigadier Estanislao López Highway (north, to Santa Fe City), National Route 11 (to the north of Santa Fe, Formosa and Paraguay), National Route 33 (to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires, and then through National Route 7 to San Luis, Mendoza and Chile), National Route 34 (north to Santiago del Estero, Tucumán and Bolivia), and National Route 174 (east, to Entre Ríos, over the Rosario-Victoria Bridge).\n\nIt is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called Circunvalación Motorway and A012 which in turn set the limits of the city.\n\nThe beltway is 30 km (19 mi) and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre, allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time. In its 30-kilometre (19 mi) length, it intersects with National Route 9, National Route 3, National Route 34, National Route 11 and National Route 174.\n\nThe official numbering system denotes this road as \"A008\" but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called \"Avenida de Circunvalación 25 de Mayo\" (\"25 of May Beltway Avenue\") commemorating the May Revolution of 1810. Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree. For example:\n• The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street (old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway, now access to Provincial Route 21), is called \"National Route A008 Tte. General Juan Carlos Sánchez\" by decree #232 of 14 May 1981.\n• The section between National Route 9 and the exit to Santa Fe (the state capital) National Route 11 on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called \"National Route A008 Dr. Constantino Razzetti\" by law #25769 of 1 September 2003.\n\nThe A012 is the second beltway at the southeast of the city. It has a semi-circular length centered around the city, running as a long-length beltway. From the National Route 9 junction on km marker 278, in the town of Esther, to the junction with National Route 11 on km marker 326 in the city of San Lorenzo it runs for 67 km (41.6 mi).\n\nThis road is popularly known as the Second Rosario Beltway, as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario. Through National Decree 1595 of 1979[56] this road switched to federal control. Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16.\n\nThe Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport is located 13 km (8 mi) west-northwest from the center of Rosario, a city in the Santa Fe Province of Argentina. The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport, and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds. The airport covers an area of 550 hectares (1,400 acres) and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe.[57][58]\n\nThe airport serves the Greater Rosario area and is the main hub for Sol Líneas Aéreas and is also served by Aerolíneas Argentinas, Copa and Gol Transportes Aéreos. There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mar del Plata (via Buenos Aires), Mendoza (vía Córdoba), Santa Fe and Villa Gesell (via Buenos Aires) cities as well as international services to, Porto Alegre, Brazil, and Punta del Este, Uruguay (direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall, winter and spring). The airport is at an altitude of 25 metres (82 ft). Its longest runway measures 3,000 metres (9,843 ft).\n\nThe Port of Rosario is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina, located in the city of Rosario, province of Santa Fe, on the left-hand (western) shore of the Paraná River, about 550 km (340 mi) upstream from the Atlantic Ocean.[59][60]\n\nAt this point of the course of the Paraná River (Kilometer 420, Mile 260), there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation. The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of 10 metres (34 ft) with minor periodic dredging. This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to Panamax standards. The Paraná is about 600 metres (1,970 ft) wide at Kilometer 418. It becomes 2,000 m (1.2 mi) wide downstream.\n\nThe port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the Greater Rosario that lie on the Paraná; the last (northernmost) able of overseas traffic being Puerto General San Martín (23 km (14 mi). It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor, which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires, Rosario, Córdoba, and the Cuyo region; going north–south it forms the axis of the Paraguay-Paraná waterway. It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports, and indirectly the whole Mercosur trade bloc. In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to 2.9 million tonnes (3,200,000 short tons).\n\nCargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the Nuevo Central Argentino, communicating with Córdoba (west) and Zárate, Buenos Aires (south), as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario. Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge, that joins the city with the province of Entre Ríos. The Rosario International Airport (located 15 km (9 mi) west) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic.\n\nRosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level. It is the home of the National University of Rosario (UNR) since 1968, which includes the Law Faculty, the Medicine Faculty, the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario (university city of Rosario) that is home to more than 10 colleges, among them the Faculty of Psychology, the Faculty of Political Sciences, and the Faculty of Architecture. It is also home of the Rosario Regional Faculty, a branch of the National Technological University (UTN). All of these national colleges are free.\n\nIn the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education, the Technical Institute, which depends directly on the UNR. With a solid tradition as for university education, it is head of several academic institutions, and is public, and free access.\n\nCurrently, there are some 80,000 university students at various institutions around the city, representing approximately 8.5% of the total population. This rate is one of the highest in Argentina. In Rosario, nearly 15% of the population benefits from higher education degrees, or have undergone at least some university studies.\n\nRosario has private colleges, as the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), the Austral University, the University of the Latin American Educational Center (UCEL), the Interamerican Open University (UAI), the Italian University of Rosario (IUNIR), the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions.\n\nRosario is the third largest urban center where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken, after Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect, notably the voseo (use of vos instead of tú as pronoun for the second person singular) and the sheísmo (form of yeísmo where ll- and y- are pronounced as a voiceless [ʃ]). Although the español rosarino does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect, it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region.\n\nOne of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario's area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the -s. When the -s is in implosive position, end of syllable or word followed by consonant, its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [h] (the word obispo is pronounced o̞ˈβihpo̞). In the popular and vulgar language, the final -s, -r, or -d are sometimes suppressed, although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education.[61]\n\nJust as in Buenos Aires, the voseo is pronominal and verbal. The pronoun tú and its associated verbal forms are non-existent (which is not the case in the Montevideo variant) The tendency to add a final -s to the verbal forms of the second person plural (vos fuistes, vos vinistes), which is rather common in Buenos Aires, is very unusual among Rosario natives.\n\nEven though the lexicon of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical, there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country (even areas where a different dialect prevails) but not with the capital, as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the rosarino speech, both formal and informal.\n\nThe Rosarigasino is a type of Jerigonza (game of words) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century. Although it has fallen into disuse, it has become a language of cult among certain local groups.\n\nRosario is the home of the football clubs Rosario Central (founded 1889) and Newell's Old Boys (founded 1903). Both play in Primera División Argentina. Central has won five National championships (in 1971, 1973, 1980, 1987 and in 2023), six National cups (1913, 1915, two cups in 1916, 1920 and 2018),[62][63][64] and one international title: the Conmebol Cup (in 1995, precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana).[65][66][67][68][69][70][71] Newell's has 6 National championships (in 1974, 1988, 1991, 1992, 2004 and in 2013) and 3 National cups (in 1911, 1921 and in 1949). Rosario's other football clubs are Club Atlético Central Córdoba, currently playing in Primera C, Club Atlético Tiro Federal Argentino in Torneo Argentino A and Argentino de Rosario in Primera D.\n\nIt is also the hometown of Argentine internationals Lionel Messi, Ángel Di María, Maximiliano Rodríguez, César Delgado, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Mauro Icardi, Giovani Lo Celso, Leandro Fernández, Ezequiel Garay, Luciana Aymar, Juan Imhoff, Ángel Correa, Nicolás Vergallo and Leonardo Senatore.\n\nThe city received international attention as the host of the II South American Games in 1982, as one of the host cities of the 1978 FIFA World Cup, the 1982 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, the 1993 FIVB Volleyball Men's U21 World Championship, the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship and the 1990 Basketball World Cup.[72] Rosario also bid for the 2019 Pan American Games but the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) voted to support La Punta instead.[73]\n\nRosario is the second choice site for Argentine rugby tests, after Buenos Aires. Famous rugby clubs from the city include Club Atlético del Rosario – one of the four UAR founding clubs – and also Jockey Club de Rosario and Duendes Rugby Club, both former winners of the Nacional de Clubes title. The city hosted the 2010 IRB Junior World Championship.\n\nThe 2010 Women's Hockey World Cup, 2004 and 2012 Champions Trophy and the 2014–15 Women's FIH Hockey World League Final were played there.\n\nIn 2014 the city hosted the Inline speed skating World Championship at Parque de la Independencia[74] and in 2015 it hosted the men's, women's and juniors' FIRS Inline Hockey World Championships at Club Atlético Provincial's indoor arena.[75]\n\nRosario hosted the 2017 World Archery Youth Championships, and will host the 2018 FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup, and the 2019 South American Beach Games.\n\nThe city was the starting point for the 2014 Dakar Rally, as well as the finishing point in 2016. It also hosted the 2015 World RX of Argentina.\n• Encuentro Internacional de Escultura en Madera-Piedra-Hierro de Rosario (International Meeting of Wood-Stone-Iron Sculpture in Rosario). Annual event (September/October), since 1993.\n• Encuentro y Fiesta Nacional de Colectividades (Communities Meeting and National Celebration). Annual event, starting in 1985, showcasing music, song, dance, cuisine and customs of foreign communities in Argentina, in the ample room provided by the Parque Nacional a la Bandera (National Flag Park). Usually held in November; in 2004 it was postponed to the beginning of December in order to avoid overlap with the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language.\n• Leyendas (\"Legends\"). A cartoon, role-playing and science fiction convention. Annually since 1999, usually in autumn (April/May), sometimes in spring (November).\n\nThe city of Rosario measures 178.69 km2 (69.0 sq mi), not all of them are fully urbanized. Its extreme points are:\n\nThe geographical center is approximately at 32°57′2″S 60°42′15″W﻿ / ﻿32.95056°S 60.70417°W﻿ / -32.95056; -60.70417\n\nThe city is located on a smoothly undulated plain typical of the Pampas, between 22.5 and 24.6 metres above mean sea level; the original settlement rests on the ravine on the right-hand shore of the Paraná, opposite a group of islands of the Paraná Delta which are partly in the jurisdiction of the province of Entre Ríos. The nearest city across the river's flood plain (60 km) is Victoria, Entre Ríos, linked to Rosario by the Rosario-Victoria Bridge.\n\nRosario lies on the ravine of the right-hand shore of the Paraná, about 24 metres (79 ft) above mean sea level, in a place with a natural slope to the low shore. The point of origin of the city is Plaza 25 de Mayo (\"May 25 Square\"), now surrounded by the municipality (Palacio de los Leones), the Basilica Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary, the Central Post Office, the Decorative Art Museum and a building called La Bola de Nieve (\"The Snowball\"). Between the Cathedral and the municipal building is Pasaje Juramento (\"Oath Passage\"), leading to the Flag Memorial. The streets mostly follow a regular checkerboard pattern.\n\nThe Rosario area has a Pampean, humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfa/Cwa),[76] and is well known for its changeable weather conditions. The city has average temperatures of 23.7 °C (74.7 °F) maximum and 11.8 °C (53.2 °F) minimum. The annual rainfall is 1,038 mm (40.9 in).\n\nRosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter. The lowest average in winter is 4.4 °C (40 °F). This is due in part to the city's flat topography, its situation on the Paraná River bank, and the presence of high density of urbanization. Those conditions have created a microclimate known as urban heat island that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas.\n\nThe temperature difference usually is greater at night than during the day, greater in winter than in summer and most apparent when winds are light. However snowfalls are extremely rare: the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007. During the spring Rosario commonly enjoys extended periods of warm weather and clear skies. Rosario has average day-night temperatures of 23–10 °C (73–50 °F). The city experiences hot and humid summer days, with maximum temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F), when northerly winds blow humid air from Brazil. The record high temperature is 40.5 °C (104.9 °F) on January 9, 2006, while the record low is −8.4 °C (17 °F) on July 15, 2020.[77]\n\nRosario has two private local television channels, Canal 3 and Canal 5 (the latter is part of the national network Telefé), and a relay station for the public national station, Canal 7 Argentina. There are also three cable TV networks (the national ones Cablevisión and Multicanal, and a local network, Cablehogar), which support two local channels, Canal 4 Noticias and Canal 6.\n\nThere are four AM radio stations: three private (licensed by the state) ones, LT3 Radio 2 (LT2), and LT8, and one public, Radio Nacional Rosario, property of the national state. Among the multitude (above 200) of FM stations, some notable ones are FM Vida, Estación del Siglo, FM Del Rosario, Cristal FM, Radio Hollywood, Fisherton-CNN, Continental Rosario, Radio 10 Rosario, Radiofónica, and Clásica Rosario.\n\nThe city has three notable newspapers: La Capital (Argentina's oldest newspaper, founded in 1867, and still published today), Rosario/12 (founded in 1991), and El Ciudadano & La Región (founded in 1999).\n\nRosario is located at the center of Argentina's optical fiber ring. The main data transport companies offer all their services in the city, from public phones to mobile networks and broadband Internet access through DSL, cable modem and Wi-Fi, and including public Internet navigation centers (cybercafes).\n\nAbout 96% of homes have a domestic telephone line, giving a total of 472,170 lines; cell phone usage has also become pervasive, as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century, reaching over 86% of the residents (866,000 mobile lines in July 2004). This demand, boosted by low prices and sale promotions, and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers, sometimes degrades the quality of the service. Most notably, the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of Christmas, New Year's Day and Friend's Day in 2004 and 2005.Rosario: Though she began her career as an acclaimed movie and television actress, Rosario Flores is a Latin Grammy Award-winning singer and songwriter. Her emotionally expressive, reedy alto careens through pop, rock and R&B to nuevo flamenco and all stops in between. As a performer, she offers theatrical creativity, physical energy, and an innate musicality that can mesmerize an audience; she consistently sells out concert halls across the globe. She has been one of Spain's premier media stars since the mid-'90s. Though better known by her full name, Rosario Flores , she bills herself simply as Rosario on her albums. Her 1995 outing De Ley -- whose songs were written by her brother Antonio -- was her popular breakthrough as a singer a decade after she began recording. The album's two singles, \"Mi Gato\" and \"Sabor Sabor,\" have since gone down in Spanish recorded music history. Her 2001 album Muchas Flores, a tribute to Catalan rhumba, became an international hit and placed on many world music charts, representing a return to her gypsy roots. She was awarded a Latin Grammy in 2002 for Best Female Pop Album. She won again for its sequel, 2003's De Mil Colores. 2008's Parte de Mí was a musical travelog and autobiography; it achieved platinum status in Spain. 2011's Raskatriski featured 11 self-penned songs. Titled for an all-but-forgotten Catalan rhumba, Rosario called it her album of \"gypsy funk.\" She served as a coach on La Voz, Spain, and a judge on Idol in Colombia, and also appeared in La Voz Kids contests in Spain and Mexico, in 2017 and 2018, while continuing to record and tour. The daughter of Antonio González (aka El Pescaílla), a musician, and Lola Flores , a dancer, singer, and actress, and the sister of Lolita Flores , an actress, and Antonio Flores , a singer/songwriter. Rosario was born on November 4, 1963, in Madrid. She began her career in the mid- to late '70s; billing herself as Rosario Rios, she recorded ¿Que Querrá Decir Esto? (1976) for CBS and acted in the film Al Fin Solos, Pero... (1977). Not much came of her efforts during this period, and her career went cold until 1984. In that year she acted in a made-for-TV Spanish miniseries, Proceso a Mariana Pineda, and recorded another album for CBS, Vuela de Noche. Rosario continued acting in the years that followed, but didn't record another album until 1992, when Sony Discos released De Ley. Co-written by her brother Antonio , De Ley was a major success in Spain, spinning off a couple big hits (\"Mi Gato\" and \"Sabor Sabor\") and warranting a follow-up. Siento (1995) proved to be an even greater success, and not just in Spain, and its hits (\"Estoy Aquí,\" \"La Estrella\") charted internationally. As before, most of the album was co-written by Antonio . For the next album, Mucho por Vivir (1996), Rosario either wrote or co-wrote the songs herself, with notable input from one of her co-producers, Fernando Illán. Mucho por Vivir didn't match the success of Siento, but it did manage one major hit, \"Yo Te Daré,\" that charted internationally. Rosario's next album, Jugar a la Locura (1999), again found her penning the songs herself. Also of note, Jugar a la Locura showcases an electronic production style that was very trendy for its time; however, this didn't amount to commercial gain, as the album met a lukewarm reception, furthering the slide in popularity for her that had begun an album earlier with Mucho por Vivir. Consequently, Rosario surrendered some of the control over her next album, Muchas Flores (2001), to professionals, most renowned among them singer/songwriter Jorge Drexler and producer Cachorro López. The end result was ideal, as Muchas Flores became a hit with critics as well as consumers. This grand comeback rejuvenated Rosario's career as an actress in addition to her recording career; the following year, she appeared as Lydia González, a bullfighter in Hable con Ella (2002), an acclaimed film by legendary Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar. The role was major and capped off Rosario's return to celebrity; won the Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar. In the following years, she continued her singing career, recording successful albums such as De Mil Colores (2004) and Contigo Me Voy (2006) for Sony. Her efforts were recognized by the Latin Grammy voters, who regularly nominated her for Best Pop Vocal Album, Female: she won in 2002 and 2004, for Muchas Flores and De Mil Colores, respectively, and though she didn't win in 2006 for Contigo Me Voy, she was nominated. Rosario returned in 2008 with her seventh album, Parte de Mí, paying tribute to some of her musical inspirations including her mother, Lola Flores . Followed by 2009's Cuéntame, Rosario delivered her ninth studio album, Raskatriski, in 2011. The following year she delivered the charting single \"Gipsy Funky Love Me Do,\" a duet with Tony Baez that was produced by Narada Michael Walden . The track was a rhumba interpretation of the Beatles ' hit, \"Love Me Do.\" The same year, Universal Spain issued Las Voces de Rosario, a compilation of her best duets. 2013's Rosario was nominated for a Latin Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album. While she busied herself with touring, coaching on La Voz Kids in Spain and Mexico, and other reality talent programs for the next couple of years, she did return to recording with 2016's Gloria a Ti. Posing on the cover in one of her mother's recital dresses, it was a heartfelt tribute to her musical family that marked a clear return to the influence of flamenco. The following year she delivered Noche de Gloria en El Teatro Real, a massive 24-track live offering that featured guest spots by some of the most popular singers in Spain including India Martinez , the electronic group Taburete Nina Pastori , and Marta Sanchez , to name a few. ~ Jason Birchmeier, RoviRosario Class Action: If you have applied for an initial Employment Authorization Document (EAD) based on a pending asylum application, you may be eligible to have your EAD processed within 30 days.\n\nA Feb. 7, 2022, court decision in Asylumworks v. Mayorkas requires USCIS to process all initial EAD applications from asylum applicants within 30 days. The decision vacates (sets aside) the Timeline Repeal Rule, a June 22, 2020, rule that removed the requirement for USCIS to process all asylum-based EAD applications (also referred to as (c)(8)s) within 30 days. This decision follows a Sept. 11, 2021, preliminary injunction in Casa de Maryland Inc. v.

Argentina covers an area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,500 sq mi),[B] making it the second-largest country in South America after Brazil, the fourth-largest country in the Americas, and the eighth-largest country in the world. It shares the bulk of the Southern Cone with Chile to the west, and is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. Argentina is a federal state subdivided into twenty-three provinces, and one autonomous city, which is the federal capital and largest city of the nation, Buenos Aires. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. Argentina claims sovereignty over the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, and a part of Antarctica.\n\nThe earliest recorded human presence in modern-day Argentina dates back to the Paleolithic period. The Inca Empire expanded to the northwest of the country in Pre-Columbian times. The country has its roots in Spanish colonization of the region during the 16th century. Argentina rose as the successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, a Spanish overseas viceroyalty founded in 1776. The declaration and fight for independence (1810–1818) was followed by an extended civil war that lasted until 1861, culminating in the country's reorganization as a federation. The country thereafter enjoyed relative peace and stability, with several waves of European immigration, mainly Italians and Spaniards, influencing its culture and demography.[17][18][19][20]\n\nFollowing the death of President Juan Perón in 1974, his widow and vice president, Isabel Perón, ascended to the presidency, before being overthrown in 1976. The following military junta, which was supported by the United States, persecuted and murdered thousands of political critics, activists, and leftists in the Dirty War, a period of state terrorism and civil unrest that lasted until the election of Raúl Alfonsín as president in 1983.\n\nArgentina is a regional power, and retains its historic status as a middle power in international affairs. A major non-NATO ally of the United States,[24] Argentina is a developing country with the second-highest HDI (human development index) in Latin America after Chile.[25] It maintains the second-largest economy in South America, and is a member of G-15 and G20. Argentina is also a founding member of the United Nations, World Bank, World Trade Organization, Mercosur, Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the Organization of Ibero-American States.\n\nThe description of the region by the word Argentina has been found on a Venetian map in 1536.[26]\n\nIn English, the name Argentina comes from the Spanish language; however, the naming itself is not Spanish, but Italian. Argentina (masculine argentino) means in Italian '(made) of silver, silver coloured', derived from the Latin argentum for silver. In Italian, the adjective or the proper noun is often used in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said l'Argentina.\n\nThe name Argentina was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators, such as Giovanni Caboto. In Spanish and Portuguese, the words for 'silver' are respectively plata and prata and '(made) of silver' is plateado and prateado, although argento for 'silver' and argentado for 'covered in silver' exist in Spanish. Argentina was first associated with the silver mountains legend, widespread among the first European explorers of the La Plata Basin.\n\nThe first written use of the name in Spanish can be traced to La Argentina,[E] a 1602 poem by Martín del Barco Centenera describing the region. Although \"Argentina\" was already in common usage by the 18th century, the country was formally named \"Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata\" by the Spanish Empire, and \"United Provinces of the Río de la Plata\" after independence.\n\nThe 1826 constitution included the first use of the name \"Argentine Republic\" in legal documents. The name \"Argentine Confederation\" was also commonly used and was formalized in the Argentine Constitution of 1853. In 1860 a presidential decree settled the country's name as \"Argentine Republic\", and that year's constitutional amendment ruled all the names since 1810 as legally valid.[F]\n\nIn English, the country was traditionally called \"the Argentine\", mimicking the typical Spanish usage la Argentina[33] and perhaps resulting from a mistaken shortening of the fuller name 'Argentine Republic'. 'The Argentine' fell out of fashion during the mid-to-late 20th century, and now the country is referred to as \"Argentina\".\n\nThe earliest traces of human life in the area now known as Argentina are dated from the Paleolithic period, with further traces in the Mesolithic and Neolithic. Until the period of European colonization, Argentina was relatively sparsely populated by a wide number of diverse cultures with different social organizations, which can be divided into three main groups.\n\nThe first group are basic hunters and food gatherers without the development of pottery, such as the Selk'nam and Yaghan in the extreme south. The second group are advanced hunters and food gatherers which include the Puelche, Querandí and Serranos in the centre-east; and the Tehuelche in the south—all of them conquered by the Mapuche spreading from Chile —and the Kom and Wichi in the north. The last group are farmers with pottery, such as the Charrúa, Minuane and Guaraní in the northeast, with slash and burn semisedentary existence; the advanced Diaguita sedentary trading culture in the northwest, which was conquered by the Inca Empire around 1480; the Toconoté and Hênîa and Kâmîare in the country's centre, and the Huarpe in the centre-west, a culture that raised llama cattle and was strongly influenced by the Incas.\n\nEuropeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 voyage of Amerigo Vespucci. The Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Sebastian Cabot visited the territory that is now Argentina in 1516 and 1526, respectively. In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the small settlement of Buenos Aires, which was abandoned in 1541.\n\nFurther colonization efforts came from Paraguay—establishing the Governorate of the Río de la Plata—Peru and Chile. Francisco de Aguirre founded Santiago del Estero in 1553. Londres was founded in 1558; Mendoza, in 1561; San Juan, in 1562; San Miguel de Tucumán, in 1565. Juan de Garay founded Santa Fe in 1573 and the same year Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera set up Córdoba. Garay went further south to re-found Buenos Aires in 1580. San Luis was established in 1596.\n\nThe Spanish Empire subordinated the economic potential of the Argentine territory to the immediate wealth of the silver and gold mines in Bolivia and Peru, and as such it became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776 with Buenos Aires as its capital.\n\nBuenos Aires repelled two ill-fated British invasions in 1806 and 1807. The ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the example of the first Atlantic Revolutions generated criticism of the absolutist monarchy that ruled the country. As in the rest of Spanish America, the overthrow of Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War created great concern.\n\nBeginning a process from which Argentina was to emerge as successor state to the Viceroyalty, the 1810 May Revolution replaced the viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros with the First Junta, a new government in Buenos Aires made up from locals. In the first clashes of the Independence War the Junta crushed a royalist counter-revolution in Córdoba, but failed to overcome those of the Banda Oriental, Upper Peru and Paraguay, which later became independent states. The French-Argentine Hippolyte Bouchard then brought his fleet to wage war against Spain overseas and attacked Spanish California, Spanish Peru and Spanish Philippines. He secured the allegiance of escaped Filipinos in San Blas who defected from the Spanish to join the Argentine navy, due to common Argentine and Philippine grievances against Spanish colonization.[48][49] Jose de San Martin's brother, Juan Fermín de San Martín, was already in the Philippines and drumming up revolutionary fervor prior to this.[50] At a later date, the Argentine sign of Inca origin, the Sun of May was adopted as a symbol by the Filipinos in the Philippine Revolution against Spain. He also secured the diplomatic recognition of Argentina from King Kamehameha I of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Historian Pacho O'Donnell affirms that Hawaii was the first state that recognized Argentina's independence. He was finally arrested in 1819 by Chilean patriots.\n\nRevolutionaries split into two antagonist groups: the Centralists and the Federalists—a move that would define Argentina's first decades of independence. The Assembly of the Year XIII appointed Gervasio Antonio de Posadas as Argentina's first Supreme Director.\n\nOn 9 July 1816, the Congress of Tucumán formalized the Declaration of Independence, which is now celebrated as Independence Day, a national holiday.[54] One year later General Martín Miguel de Güemes stopped royalists on the north. General José de San Martín joined Bernardo O'Higgins, and they led a combined army across the Andes and secured the independence of Chile; then it was sent by O'Higgins orders to the Spanish stronghold of Lima and proclaimed the independence of Peru.[G] In 1819 Buenos Aires enacted a centralist constitution that was soon abrogated by federalists.\n\nSome of the most important figures of Argentine independence made a proposal known as the Inca plan of 1816, which proposed that the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (Present Argentina) should be a monarchy, led by a descendant of the Inca. Juan Bautista Túpac Amaru (half-brother of Túpac Amaru II) was proposed as monarch.[58] Some examples of those who supported this proposal were Manuel Belgrano, José de San Martín and Martín Miguel de Güemes. The Congress of Tucumán finally decided to reject the Inca plan, creating instead a republican, centralist state.[59][60]\n\nThe 1820 Battle of Cepeda, fought between the Centralists and the Federalists, resulted in the end of the Supreme Director rule. In 1826 Buenos Aires enacted another centralist constitution, with Bernardino Rivadavia being appointed as the first president of the country. However, the interior provinces soon rose against him, forced his resignation and discarded the constitution. Centralists and Federalists resumed the civil war; the latter prevailed and formed the Argentine Confederation in 1831, led by Juan Manuel de Rosas. During his regime he faced a French blockade (1838–1840), the War of the Confederation (1836–1839), and an Anglo-French blockade (1845–1850), but remained undefeated and prevented further loss of national territory. His trade restriction policies, however, angered the interior provinces and in 1852 Justo José de Urquiza, another powerful caudillo, beat him out of power. As the new president of the Confederation, Urquiza enacted the liberal and federal 1853 Constitution. Buenos Aires seceded but was forced back into the Confederation after being defeated in the 1859 Battle of Cepeda.\n\nOverpowering Urquiza in the 1861 Battle of Pavón, Bartolomé Mitre secured Buenos Aires' predominance and was elected as the first president of the reunified country. He was followed by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento and Nicolás Avellaneda; these three presidencies set up the basis of the modern Argentine State.\n\nStarting with Julio Argentino Roca in 1880, ten consecutive federal governments emphasized liberal economic policies. The massive wave of European immigration they promoted—second only to the United States'—led to a near-reinvention of Argentine society and economy that by 1908 had placed the country as the seventh wealthiest developed nation in the world. Driven by this immigration wave and decreasing mortality, the Argentine population grew fivefold and the economy 15-fold: from 1870 to 1910, Argentina's wheat exports went from 100,000 to 2,500,000 t (110,000 to 2,760,000 short tons) per year, while frozen beef exports increased from 25,000 to 365,000 t (28,000 to 402,000 short tons) per year, placing Argentina as one of the world's top five exporters. Its railway mileage rose from 503 to 31,104 km (313 to 19,327 mi). Fostered by a new public, compulsory, free and secular education system, literacy quickly increased from 22% to 65%, a level higher than most Latin American nations would reach even fifty years later. Furthermore, real GDP grew so fast that despite the huge immigration influx, per capita income between 1862 and 1920 went from 67% of developed country levels to 100%: In 1865, Argentina was already one of the top 25 nations by per capita income. By 1908, it had surpassed Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands to reach 7th place—behind Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Argentina's per capita income was 70% higher than Italy's, 90% higher than Spain's, 180% higher than Japan's and 400% higher than Brazil's. Despite these unique achievements, the country was slow to meet its original goals of industrialization: after the steep development of capital-intensive local industries in the 1920s, a significant part of the manufacturing sector remained labour-intensive in the 1930s.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1884, the so-called Conquest of the Desert occurred, with the purpose of tripling the Argentine territory by means of the constant confrontations between natives and Criollos in the border,[75] and the appropriation of the indigenous territories. The first conquest consisted of a series of military incursions into the Pampa and Patagonian territories dominated by the indigenous peoples,[76] distributing them among the members of the Sociedad Rural Argentina, financiers of the expeditions.[77] The conquest of Chaco lasted up to the end of the century,[78] since its full ownership of the national economic system only took place when the mere extraction of wood and tannin was replaced by the production of cotton.[79] The Argentine government considered indigenous people as inferior beings, without the same rights as Criollos and Europeans.[80]\n\nIn 1912, President Roque Sáenz Peña enacted universal and secret male suffrage, which allowed Hipólito Yrigoyen, leader of the Radical Civic Union (or UCR), to win the 1916 election. He enacted social and economic reforms and extended assistance to small farms and businesses. Argentina stayed neutral during World War I. The second administration of Yrigoyen faced an economic crisis, precipitated by the Great Depression.\n\nIn 1930, Yrigoyen was ousted from power by the military led by José Félix Uriburu. Although Argentina remained among the fifteen richest countries until mid-century, this coup d'état marks the start of the steady economic and social decline that pushed the country back into underdevelopment.[82]\n\nUriburu ruled for two years; then Agustín Pedro Justo was elected in a fraudulent election, and signed a controversial treaty with the United Kingdom. Argentina stayed neutral during World War II, a decision that had full British support but was rejected by the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1943 a military coup d'état led by General Arturo Rawson toppled the democratically elected government of Ramón Castillo. Under pressure from the United States, later Argentina declared war on the Axis Powers (on 27 March 1945, roughly a month before the end of World War II in Europe).\n\nDuring the Rawson dictatorship a relatively unknown military colonel named Juan Perón was named head of the Labour Department. Perón quickly managed to climb the political ladder, being named defence minister in 1944. Being perceived as a political threat by rivals in the military and the conservative camp, he was forced to resign in 1945, and was arrested days later. He was finally released under mounting pressure from both his base and several allied unions. He later became president after a landslide victory over the UCR in the 1946 general election as the Labour candidate.[84]\n\nThe Labour Party (later renamed Justicialist Party), the most powerful and influential party in Argentine history, came into power with the rise of Juan Perón to the presidency in 1946. He nationalized strategic industries and services, improved wages and working conditions, paid the full external debt and claimed he achieved nearly full employment. He pushed Congress to enact women's suffrage in 1947, and developed a system of social assistance for the most vulnerable sectors of society. The economy began to decline in 1950 due in part to government expenditures and the protectionist economic policies.[87]\n\nHe also engaged in a campaign of political suppression. Anyone who was perceived to be a political dissident or potential rival was subject to threats, physical violence and harassment. The Argentine intelligentsia, the middle-class, university students, and professors were seen as particularly troublesome. Perón fired over 2,000 university professors and faculty members from all major public education institutions.[88]\n\nPerón tried to bring most trade and labour unions under his thumb, regularly resorting to violence when needed. For instance, the meat-packers union leader, Cipriano Reyes, organized strikes in protest against the government after elected labour movement officials were forcefully replaced by Peronist puppets from the Peronist Party. Reyes was soon arrested on charges of terrorism, though the allegations were never substantiated. Reyes, who was never formally charged, was tortured in prison for five years and only released after the regime's downfall in 1955.[89]\n\nPerón managed to get re-elected in 1951. His wife Eva Perón, who played a critical role in the party, died of cancer in 1952. As the economy continued to tank, Perón started losing popular support, and came to be seen as a threat to the national process. The Navy took advantage of Perón's withering political power, and bombed the Plaza de Mayo in 1955. Perón survived the attack, but a few months later, during the Liberating Revolution coup, he was deposed and went into exile in Spain.\n\nThe new head of State, Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, proscribed Peronism and banned the party from any future elections. Arturo Frondizi from the UCR won the 1958 general election. He encouraged investment to achieve energetic and industrial self-sufficiency, reversed a chronic trade deficit and lifted the ban on Peronism; yet his efforts to stay on good terms with both the Peronists and the military earned him the rejection of both and a new coup forced him out. Amidst the political turmoil, Senate leader José María Guido reacted swiftly and applied anti-power vacuum legislation, ascending to the presidency himself; elections were repealed and Peronism was prohibited once again. Arturo Illia was elected in 1963 and led an increase in prosperity across the board; however he was overthrown in 1966 by another military coup d'état led by General Juan Carlos Onganía in the self-proclaimed Argentine Revolution, creating a new military government that sought to rule indefinitely.\n\nFollowing several years of military rule, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse was appointed president by the military junta in 1971. Under increasing political pressure for the return of democracy, Lanusse called for elections in 1973. Perón was banned from running but the Peronist party was allowed to participate. The presidential elections were won by Perón's surrogate candidate, Hector Cámpora, a left-wing Peronist, who took office on 25 May 1973. A month later, in June, Perón returned from Spain. One of Cámpora's first presidential actions was to grant amnesty to members of organizations that had carried out political assassinations and terrorist attacks, and to those who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges. Cámpora's months-long tenure in government was beset by political and social unrest. Over 600 social conflicts, strikes, and factory occupations took place within a single month.[94] Even though far-left terrorist organizations had suspended their armed struggle, their joining with the participatory democracy process was interpreted as a direct threat by the Peronist right-wing faction.[95]\n\nAmid a state of political, social, and economic upheaval, Cámpora and Vice President Vicente Solano Lima resigned in July 1973, calling for new elections, but this time with Perón as the Justicialist Party nominee. Perón won the election with his wife Isabel Perón as vice president. Perón's third term was marked by escalating conflict between left and right-wing factions within the Peronist party, as well as the return of armed terror guerrilla groups such as the Guevarist ERP, leftist Peronist Montoneros, and the state-backed far-right Triple A. After a series of heart attacks and signs of pneumonia in 1974, Perón's health deteriorated quickly. He suffered a final heart attack on Monday, 1 July 1974, and died at 13:15. He was 78 years old. After his death, Isabel Perón, his wife and vice president, succeeded him in office. During her presidency, a military junta, along with the Peronists' far-right fascist faction, once again became the de facto head of state. Isabel Perón served as President of Argentina from 1974 until 1976, when she was ousted by the military. Her short presidency was marked by the collapse of Argentine political and social systems, leading to a constitutional crisis that paved the way for a decade of instability, left-wing terrorist guerrilla attacks, and state-sponsored terrorism.[87][96][97]\n\nThe \"Dirty War\" (Spanish: Guerra Sucia) was part of Operation Condor, which included the participation of other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone. The Dirty War involved state terrorism in Argentina and elsewhere in the Southern Cone against political dissidents, with military and security forces employing urban and rural violence against left-wing guerrillas, political dissidents, and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or somehow contrary to the neoliberal economic policies of the regime.[98][99][100] Victims of the violence in Argentina alone included an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 left-wing activists and militants, including trade unionists, students, journalists, Marxists, Peronist guerrillas,[101] and alleged sympathizers. Most of the victims were casualties of state terrorism. The opposing guerrillas' victims numbered nearly 500–540 military and police officials[102] and up to 230 civilians.[103] Argentina received technical support and military aid from the United States government during the Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and Reagan administrations.\n\nThe exact chronology of the repression is still debated, yet the roots of the long political war may have started in 1969 when trade unionists were targeted for assassination by Peronist and Marxist paramilitaries. Individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left can be traced back even further to the Bombing of Plaza de Mayo in 1955. The Trelew massacre of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance commencing in 1973, and Isabel Perón's \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during Operativo Independencia (Operation Independence) in 1975, are also possible events signaling the beginning of the Dirty War.[H]\n\nOnganía shut down Congress, banned all political parties, and dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two massive protests: the Cordobazo and the Rosariazo. The terrorist guerrilla organization Montoneros kidnapped and executed Aramburu. The newly chosen head of government, Alejandro Agustín Lanusse, seeking to ease the growing political pressure, allowed Héctor José Cámpora to become the Peronist candidate instead of Perón. Cámpora won the March 1973 election, issued pardons for condemned guerrilla members, and then secured Perón's return from his exile in Spain.\n\nOn the day Perón returned to Argentina, the clash between Peronist internal factions—right-wing union leaders and left-wing youth from the Montoneros—resulted in the Ezeiza Massacre. Overwhelmed by political violence, Cámpora resigned and Perón won the following September 1973 election with his third wife Isabel as vice-president. He expelled Montoneros from the party and they became once again a clandestine organization. José López Rega organized the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA) to fight against them and the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP).\n\nPerón died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, who signed a secret decree empowering the military and the police to \"annihilate\" the left-wing subversion, stopping ERP's attempt to start a rural insurgence in Tucumán province. Isabel Perón was ousted one year later by a junta of the combined armed forces, led by army general Jorge Rafael Videla. They initiated the National Reorganization Process, often shortened to Proceso.\n\nThe Proceso shut down Congress, removed the judges on the Supreme Court, banned political parties and unions, and resorted to employing the forced disappearance of suspected guerrilla members including individuals suspected of being associated with the left-wing. By the end of 1976, the Montoneros had lost nearly 2,000 members and by 1977, the ERP was completely subdued. Nevertheless, the severely weakened Montoneros launched a counterattack in 1979, which was quickly put down, effectively ending the guerrilla threat and securing the junta's position in power.[citation needed]\n\nIn March 1982, an Argentine force took control of the British territory of South Georgia and, on 2 April, Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. The United Kingdom dispatched a task force to regain possession. Argentina surrendered on 14 June and its forces were taken home. Street riots in Buenos Aires followed the humiliating defeat and the military leadership stood down.[115][116] Reynaldo Bignone replaced Galtieri and began to organize the transition to democratic governance.\n\nRaúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections campaigning for the prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations during the Proceso: the Trial of the Juntas and other martial courts sentenced all the coup's leaders but, under military pressure, he also enacted the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws,[118][119] which halted prosecutions further down the chain of command. The worsening economic crisis and hyperinflation reduced his popular support and the Peronist Carlos Menem won the 1989 election. Soon after, riots forced Alfonsín to an early resignation.\n\nMenem embraced and enacted neoliberal policies: a fixed exchange rate, business deregulation, privatizations, and the dismantling of protectionist barriers normalized the economy in the short term. He pardoned the officers who had been sentenced during Alfonsín's government. The 1994 Constitutional Amendment allowed Menem to be elected for a second term. With the economy beginning to decline in 1995, and with increasing unemployment and recession, the UCR, led by Fernando de la Rúa, returned to the presidency in the 1999 elections.\n\nDe la Rúa left Menem's economic plan in effect despite the worsening crisis, which led to growing social discontent. Massive capital flight from the country was responded to with a freezing of bank accounts, generating further turmoil. The December 2001 riots forced him to resign. Congress appointed Eduardo Duhalde as acting president, who revoked the fixed exchange rate established by Menem, causing many working- and middle-class Argentines to lose a significant portion of their savings. By late 2002, the economic crisis began to recede, but the assassination of two piqueteros by the police caused political unrest, prompting Duhalde to move elections forward. Néstor Kirchner was elected as the new president. On 26 May 2003, he was sworn in.[127]\n\nBoosting the neo-Keynesian economic policies laid by Duhalde, Kirchner ended the economic crisis attaining significant fiscal and trade surpluses, and rapid GDP growth. Under his administration, Argentina restructured its defaulted debt with an unprecedented discount of about 70% on most bonds, paid off debts with the International Monetary Fund, purged the military of officers with dubious human rights records, nullified and voided the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws,[132][I] ruled them as unconstitutional, and resumed legal prosecution of the Junta's crimes. He did not run for reelection, promoting instead the candidacy of his wife, senator Cristina Kirchner who won the 2007 and 2011 elections. During Kirchner's presidecy promoted foreign relations with countries such as Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba, whilst US and UK relations increasingly strained. Despite increased renewable energy production and subsidies during her tenure, the overall economy had been sluggish since 2011.[135]\n\nOn 22 November 2015, after a tie in the first round of presidential elections on 25 October, centre-right coalition candidate Mauricio Macri won the first ballotage in Argentina's history, beating Front for Victory candidate Daniel Scioli and becoming president-elect.[136] Macri was the first democratically elected non-peronist president since 1916 that managed to complete his term in office without being overthrown.[137] He took office on 10 December 2015 and inherited an economy with a high inflation rate and in a poor shape.[138] In April 2016, the Macri government introduced neoliberal austerity measures intended to tackle inflation and overblown public deficits.[139] Under Macri's administration, economic recovery remained elusive with GDP shrinking 3.4%, inflation totaling 240%, billions of US dollars issued in sovereign debt, and mass poverty increasing by the end of his term.[140][141] He ran for re-election in 2019 but lost by nearly eight percentage points to Alberto Fernández, the Justicialist Party candidate.[142]\n\nFernández and vice president Cristina Kirchner took office in December 2019,[143] just months before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Argentina and among accusations of corruption, bribery and misuse of public funds during Néstor and Cristina Kirchner's presidencies.[144][145] In November 2021, the centre-left coalition of Argentina's ruling Peronist party, Frente de Todos (Front for Everyone), lost its majority in Congress, for the first time in almost 40 years, in midterm legislative elections. The election victory of the centre-right coalition, Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change) limited Fernández' power during his final two years in office. Losing control of the Senate made it difficult for him to make key appointments, including to the judiciary. It also forced him to negotiate with the opposition on every initiative send to the legislature.[146][147]\n\nIn April 2023, Fernández announced that he would not seek re-election in the next presidential election.[148] The November 2023 election run-off ended in a win for libertarian outsider Javier Milei with 55.7% of the vote against 44.4% to ruling coalition candidate Sergio Massa.[149] Milei's presidency began on 10 December 2023.[150]\n\nWith a mainland surface area of 2,780,400 km2 (1,073,518 sq mi),[B] Argentina is located in southern South America, sharing land borders with Chile across the Andes to the west;[151] Bolivia and Paraguay to the north; Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east;[152] and the Drake Passage to the south; for an overall land border length of 9,376 km (5,826 mi). Its coastal border over the Río de la Plata and South Atlantic Ocean is 5,117 km (3,180 mi) long.[152]\n\nArgentina's highest point is Aconcagua in the Mendoza province (6,959 m (22,831 ft) above sea level),[154] also the highest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres. The lowest point is Laguna del Carbón in the San Julián Great Depression Santa Cruz province (−105 m (−344 ft) below sea level,[154] also the lowest point in the Southern and Western Hemispheres, and the seventh lowest point on Earth).[156]\n\nThe northernmost point is at the confluence of the Grande de San Juan and Mojinete rivers in Jujuy province; the southernmost is Cape San Pío in Tierra del Fuego province; the easternmost is northeast of Bernardo de Irigoyen, Misiones and the westernmost is within Los Glaciares National Park in Santa Cruz province.[152] The maximum north–south distance is 3,694 km (2,295 mi), while the maximum east–west one is 1,423 km (884 mi).[152]\n\nSome of the major rivers are the Paraná, Uruguay—which join to form the Río de la Plata, Paraguay, Salado, Negro, Santa Cruz, Pilcomayo, Bermejo and Colorado. These rivers are discharged into the Argentine Sea, the shallow area of the Atlantic Ocean over the Patagonian Shelf, an unusually wide continental platform. Its waters are influenced by two major ocean currents: the warm Brazil Current and the cold Falklands Current.\n\nArgentina is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world[161] hosting one of the greatest ecosystem varieties in the world: 15 continental zones, 2 marine zones, and the Antarctic region are all represented in its territory.[161] This huge ecosystem variety has led to a biological diversity that is among the world's largest:[161][162] 9,372 catalogued vascular plant species (ranked 24th);[J] 1,038 catalogued bird species (ranked 14th);[K] 375 catalogued mammal species (ranked 12th);[L] 338 catalogued reptilian species (ranked 16th); and 162 catalogued amphibian species (ranked 19th).\n\nIn Argentina forest cover is around 10% of the total land area, equivalent to 28,573,000 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, down from 35,204,000 hectares (ha) in 1990. In 2020, naturally regenerating forest covered 27,137,000 hectares (ha) and planted forest covered 1,436,000 hectares (ha). Of the naturally regenerating forest 0% was reported to be primary forest (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 7% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 0% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership, 4% private ownership and 96% with ownership listed as other or unknown.[163][164]\n\nThe original pampa had virtually no trees; some imported species such as the American sycamore or eucalyptus are present along roads or in towns and country estates (estancias). The only tree-like plant native to the pampa is the evergreen Ombú. The surface soils of the pampa are a deep black colour, primarily mollisols, known commonly as humus. This makes the region one of the most agriculturally productive on Earth; however, this is also responsible for decimating much of the original ecosystem, to make way for commercial agriculture.[citation needed] The western pampas receive less rainfall, this dry pampa is a plain of short grasses or steppe.[165][166]\n\nThe National Parks of Argentina make up a network of 35 national parks in Argentina. The parks cover a very varied set of terrains and biotopes, from Baritú National Park on the northern border with Bolivia to Tierra del Fuego National Park in the far south of the continent. The Administración de Parques Nacionales (National Parks Administration) is the agency that preserves and manages these national parks along with Natural monuments and National Reserves within the country.[167] Argentina had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.21/10, ranking it 47th globally out of 172 countries.[168]\n\nIn general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm humid subtropical, moderate humid subtropical, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features.[170][171] Although the most populated areas are generally temperate, Argentina has an exceptional amount of climate diversity,[172] ranging from subtropical in the north to polar in the far south.[173] Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including Subtropical rainforests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south.[174] The average annual precipitation ranges from 150 millimetres (6 in) in the driest parts of Patagonia to over 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in the westernmost parts of Patagonia and the northeastern parts of the country.[172] Mean annual temperatures range from 5 °C (41 °F) in the far south to 25 °C (77 °F) in the north.[172]\n\nMajor wind currents include the cool Pampero Winds blowing on the flat plains of Patagonia and the Pampas; following the cold front, warm currents blow from the north in middle and late winter, creating mild conditions. The Sudestada usually moderates cold temperatures but brings very heavy rains, rough seas and coastal flooding. It is most common in late autumn and winter along the central coast and in the Río de la Plata estuary. The Zonda, a hot dry wind, affects Cuyo and the central Pampas. Squeezed of all moisture during the 6,000 m (19,685 ft) descent from the Andes, Zonda winds can blow for hours with gusts up to 120 km/h (75 mph), fueling wildfires and causing damage; between June and November, when the Zonda blows, snowstorms and blizzard (viento blanco) conditions usually affect higher elevations.\n\nClimate change in Argentina is predicted to have significant effects on the living conditions in Argentina.[177]: 30 The climate of Argentina is changing with regards to precipitation patterns and temperatures. The highest increases in precipitation (from the period 1960–2010) have occurred in the eastern parts of the country. The increase in precipitation has led to more variability in precipitation from year to year in the northern parts of the country, with a higher risk of prolonged droughts, disfavouring agriculture in these regions.\n\nIn the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals.[178][179] Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina;[179] and the country alternated periods of democracy (1912–1930, 1946–1955, and 1973–1976) with periods of restricted democracy and military rule.[178] Following a transition that began in 1983,[180] full-scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished.[178][179] Argentina's democracy endured through the 2001–02 crisis and to the present day; it is regarded as more robust than both its pre-1983 predecessors and other democracies in Latin America.[179] According to the V-Dem Democracy indices, Argentina in 2023 was the second most electoral democratic country in Latin America.[181]\n\nArgentina is a federal constitutional republic and representative democracy. The government is regulated by a system of checks and balances defined by the Constitution of Argentina, the country's supreme legal document. The seat of government is the city of Buenos Aires, as designated by Congress. Suffrage is universal, equal, secret and mandatory.[M]\n\nThe federal government is composed of three branches. The Legislative branch consists of the bicameral Congress, made up of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties and has the power of the purse and of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting members of the government. The Chamber of Deputies represents the people and has 257 voting members elected to a four-year term. Seats are apportioned among the provinces by population every tenth year. As of 2014 ten provinces have just five deputies while the Buenos Aires Province, being the most populous one, has 70. The Chamber of Senators represents the provinces, and has 72 members elected at-large to six-year terms, with each province having three seats; one-third of Senate seats are up for election every other year. At least one-third of the candidates presented by the parties must be women.\n\nIn the Executive branch, the President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law—subject to Congressional override—and appoints the members of the Cabinet and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies. The President is elected directly by the vote of the people, serves a four-year term and may be elected to office no more than twice in a row.\n\nThe Judicial branch includes the Supreme Court and lower federal courts interpret laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional. The Judicial is independent of the Executive and the Legislative. The Supreme Court has seven members appointed by the President—subject to Senate approval—who serve for life. The lower courts' judges are proposed by the Council of Magistracy (a secretariat composed of representatives of judges, lawyers, researchers, the Executive and the Legislative), and appointed by the president on Senate approval.\n\nArgentina is a federation of twenty-three provinces and one autonomous city, Buenos Aires. Provinces are divided for administration purposes into departments and municipalities, except for Buenos Aires Province, which is divided into partidos. The City of Buenos Aires is divided into communes.\n\nProvinces hold all the power that they chose not to delegate to the federal government; they must be representative republics and must not contradict the Constitution. Beyond this they are fully autonomous: they enact their own constitutions, freely organize their local governments, and own and manage their natural and financial resources. Some provinces have bicameral legislatures, while others have unicameral ones.[N]\n\nLa Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and Formosa, Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Antártida e Islas del Atlántico Sur Province in 1990. It has three components, although two are nominal because they are not under Argentine sovereignty. The first is the Argentine part of Tierra del Fuego; the second is an area of Antarctica claimed by Argentina that overlaps with similar areas claimed by the UK and Chile; the third comprises the two disputed British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.[201]\n\nForeign policy is handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship, which answers to the President. The country is one of the G-15 and G-20 major economies of the world, and a founding member of the UN, WBG, WTO and OAS. In 2012 Argentina was elected again to a two-year non-permanent position on the United Nations Security Council and is participating in major peacekeeping operations in Haiti, Cyprus, Western Sahara and the Middle East.[202] Argentina is described as a middle power.[203]\n\nA prominent Latin American and Southern Cone regional power, Argentina co-founded OEI and CELAC. It is also a founding member of the Mercosur block, having Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela as partners. Since 2002 the country has emphasized its key role in Latin American integration, and the block—which has some supranational legislative functions—is its first international priority.\n\nArgentina claims 965,597 km2 (372,819 sq mi) in Antarctica, where it has the world's oldest continuous state presence, since 1904.[205] This overlaps claims by Chile and the United Kingdom, though all such claims fall under the provisions of the 1961 Antarctic Treaty, of which Argentina is a founding signatory and permanent consulting member, with the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat being based in Buenos Aires.[206]\n\nArgentina disputes sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas), and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are administered by the United Kingdom as Overseas Territories. Argentina is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.[208] Argentina is a Major non-NATO ally since 1998[24] and an OECD candidate country since January 2022.[209]\n\nThe president holds the title of commander-in-chief of the Argentine Armed Forces, as part of a legal framework that imposes a strict separation between national defence and internal security systems:[210][211] The National Defence System, an exclusive responsibility of the federal government, coordinated by the Ministry of Defence, and comprising the Army, the Navy and the Air Force.[213] Ruled and monitored by Congress through the Houses' Defence Committees,[215] it is organized on the essential principle of legitimate self-defence: the repelling of any external military aggression in order to guarantee freedom of the people, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity.[215] Its secondary missions include committing to multinational operations within the framework of the United Nations, participating in internal support missions, assisting friendly countries, and establishing a sub-regional defence system.[215]\n\nMilitary service is voluntary, with enlistment age between 18 and 24 years old and no conscription.[216] Argentina's defence has historically been one of the best equipped in the region, even managing its own weapon research facilities, shipyards, ordnance, tank and plane factories. However, real military expenditures declined steadily after the defeat in the Falklands/Malvinas War and the defence budget in 2011 was only about 0.74% of GDP, a historical minimum,[218] below the Latin American average. Within the defence budget itself, funding for training and even basic maintenance has been significantly cut, a factor contributing to the accidental loss of the Argentine submarine San Juan in 2017. The result has been a steady erosion of Argentine military capabilities, with some arguing that Argentina had, by the end of the 2010s, ceased to be a capable military power.[219]\n\nThe Interior Security System is jointly administered by the federal and subscribing provincial governments.[211] At the federal level it is coordinated by the Interior, Security and Justice ministries, and monitored by Congress.[211] It is enforced by the Federal Police; the Prefecture, which fulfills coast guard duties; the Gendarmerie, which serves border guard tasks; and the Airport Security Police.[220] At the provincial level it is coordinated by the respective internal security ministries and enforced by local police agencies.[211]\n\nArgentina was the only South American country to send warships and cargo planes in 1991 to the Gulf War under UN mandate and has remained involved in peacekeeping efforts in multiple locations such as UNPROFOR in Croatia/Bosnia, Gulf of Fonseca, UNFICYP in Cyprus (where among Army and Marines troops the Air Force provided the UN Air contingent since 1994) and MINUSTAH in Haiti. Argentina is the only Latin American country to maintain troops in Kosovo during SFOR (and later EUFOR) operations where combat engineers of the Argentine Armed Forces are embedded in an Italian brigade.\n\nIn 2007, an Argentine contingent including helicopters, boats and water purification plants was sent to help Bolivia against their worst floods in decades.[221] In 2010 the Armed Forces were also involved in Haiti and Chile humanitarian responses after their respective earthquakes.\n\nBenefiting from rich natural resources, a highly literate population, a diversified industrial base, and an export-oriented agricultural sector, the economy of Argentina is Latin America's third-largest,[222] and the second-largest in South America.[223] Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world, on the 20th century in 1913 it was one of the wealthiest countries in the world by GDP per capita[224] It has a \"very high\" rating on the Human Development Index[13] and ranks 66th by nominal GDP per capita,[225] with a considerable internal market size and a growing share of the high-tech sector. As a middle emerging economy and one of the world's top developing nations, it is a member of the G-20 major economies.[226][O]\n\nArgentina is the largest producer in the world of yerba-maté (due to the large domestic consumption of maté), one of the five largest producers in the world of soybeans, maize, sunflower seed, lemon and pear, one of the ten largest producers in the world of barley, grape, artichoke, tobacco and cotton, and one of the 15 largest producers in the world of wheat, sugarcane, sorghum and grapefruit. It is the largest producer in South America of wheat, sunflower seed, barley, lemon and pear.[228][229] In wine, Argentina is usually among the ten largest producers in the world.[230] Argentina is also a traditional meat exporter, having been, in 2019, the 4th world producer of beef, with a production of 3 million tons (only behind US, Brazil and China), the 4th world producer of honey, and the 10th world producer of wool, in addition to other relevant productions.[231][232]\n\nThe mining industry of Argentina is less prominent compared to other countries but stands out as the fourth-largest producer of lithium,[233] the 11th-largest of silver[234] and 17th-largest of gold[235] worldwide. The country also excels in natural gas production, being the largest producer in South America and the 18th-largest globally. Additionally Argentina produces an average of 500,000 barrels/day of petroleum, despite the under-utilization of the Vaca Muerta field due to technical and financial limitations in resource extraction.[236][237]\n\nIn 2012 , manufacturing accounted for 20.3% of GDP—the largest sector in the nation's economy.[238] Well-integrated into Argentine agriculture, half of the industrial exports have rural origin.[238] With a 6.5% production growth rate in 2011 ,[239] the diversified manufacturing sector rests on a steadily growing network of industrial parks (314 as of 2013 )[240][241] In 2012 the leading sectors by volume were: food processing, beverages and tobacco products; motor vehicles and auto parts; textiles and leather; refinery products and biodiesel; chemicals and pharmaceuticals; steel, aluminium and iron; industrial and farm machinery; home appliances and furniture; plastics and tires; glass and cement; and recording and print media.[238] In addition, Argentina has since long been one of the top five wine-producing countries in the world.[238]\n\nHigh inflation—a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades—has become a trouble once again,[242] with an annual rate of 24.8% in 2017.[243] In 2023 the inflation reached 102.5% among the highest inflation rates in the world.[244] Approximately 43% of the Argentina's population lives below the poverty line as of 2023.[245] To deter it and support the peso, the government imposed foreign currency control.[246] Income distribution, having improved since 2002, is classified as \"medium\", although it is still considerably unequal.[12] In January 2024, Argentina's poverty rate reached 57.4%, the highest poverty rate in the country since 2004.[247]\n\nArgentina ranks 85th out of 180 countries in the Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index,[248] an improvement of 22 positions over its 2014 rankings.[249] Argentina settled its long-standing debt default crisis in 2016 with the so-called vulture funds after the election of Mauricio Macri, allowing Argentina to enter capital markets for the first time in a decade.[250] The government of Argentina defaulted on 22 May 2020 by failing to pay a $500 million bill by its due date to its creditors. Negotiations for the restructuring of $66 billion of its debt continue.[251]\n\nPoverty in Argentina was 41.7 percent at the end of the second half of 2023.[252]\n\nThe country had 5.57 million visitors in 2013, ranking in terms of international tourist arrivals as the top destination in South America, and second in Latin America after Mexico.[253] Revenues from international tourists reached US$4.41 billion in 2013, down from US$4.89 billion in 2012.[253] The country's capital city, Buenos Aires, is the most visited city in South America.[254] There are 30 National Parks of Argentina including many World Heritage Sites.\n\nBy 2004 Buenos Aires, all provincial capitals except Ushuaia, and all medium-sized towns were interconnected by 69,412 km (43,131 mi) of paved roads, out of a total road network of 231,374 km (143,769 mi).[255] In 2021, the country had about 2,800 km (1,740 mi) of dual carriageways, most leaving the capital Buenos Aires, linking it with cities such as Rosario and Córdoba, Santa Fe, Mar del Plata and Paso de los Libres (in border with Brazil), there are also dual carriageways leaving from Mendoza towards the capital, and between Córdoba and Santa Fé, among other locations.[256] Nevertheless, this road infrastructure is still inadequate and cannot handle the sharply growing demand caused by deterioration of the railway system.[257]\n\nArgentina has the largest railway system in Latin America, with 36,966 km (22,970 mi) of operating lines in 2008 , out of a full network of almost 48,000 km (29,826 mi).[258] This system links all 23 provinces plus Buenos Aires City, and connects with all neighbouring countries.[257] There are four incompatible gauges in use; this forces virtually all interregional freight traffic to pass through Buenos Aires.[257] The system has been in decline since the 1940s: regularly running up large budgetary deficits, by 1991 it was transporting 1,400 times less goods than it did in 1973.[257] However, in recent years the system has experienced a greater degree of investment from the state, in both commuter rail lines and long-distance lines, renewing rolling stock and infrastructure.[259][260] In April 2015, by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law which re-created Ferrocarriles Argentinos (2015), effectively re-nationalizing the country's railways, a move which saw support from all major political parties on both sides of the political spectrum.[261][262][263]\n\nIn 2012 there were about 11,000 km (6,835 mi) of waterways,[264] mostly comprising the La Plata, Paraná, Paraguay and Uruguay rivers, with Buenos Aires, Zárate, Campana, Rosario, San Lorenzo, Santa Fe, Barranqueras and San Nicolas de los Arroyos as the main fluvial ports. Some of the largest sea ports are La Plata–Ensenada, Bahía Blanca, Mar del Plata, Quequén–Necochea, Comodoro Rivadavia, Puerto Deseado, Puerto Madryn, Ushuaia and San Antonio Oeste. Buenos Aires has historically been the most important port; however since the 1990s the Up-River port region has become dominant: stretching along 67 km (42 mi) of the Paraná river shore in Santa Fe province, it includes 17 ports and in 2013 accounted for 50% of all exports.\n\nIn 2013 there were 161 airports with paved runways[265] out of more than a thousand.[257] The Ezeiza International Airport, about 35 km (22 mi) from downtown Buenos Aires, is the largest in the country, followed by Cataratas del Iguazú in Misiones, and El Plumerillo in Mendoza.[257] Aeroparque, in the city of Buenos Aires, is the most important domestic airport.\n\nIn 2020, more than 60% of Argentina's electricity came from non-renewable sources such as natural gas, oil and coal. 27% came from hydropower, 7.3% from wind and solar energy and 4.4% from nuclear energy.[269] At the end of 2021 Argentina was the 21st country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (11.3 GW), the 26th country in the world in terms of installed wind energy (3.2 GW) and the 43rd country in the world in terms of installed solar energy (1.0 GW).[270]\n\nThe wind potential of the Patagonia region is considered gigantic, with estimates that the area could provide enough electricity to sustain the consumption of a country like Brazil alone. However, Argentina has faces infrastructural challenges in transferring electricity from wind-rich rural areas to its population hubs[271]\n\nIn 1974 it was the first country in Latin America to put in-line a commercial nuclear power plant, Atucha I. Although the Argentine-built parts for that station amounted to 10% of the total, the nuclear fuel it uses are since entirely built in the country. Later nuclear power stations employed a higher percentage of Argentine-built components; Embalse, finished in 1983, a 30% and the 2011 Atucha II reactor a 40%.[272]\n\nArgentines have received three Nobel Prizes in the Sciences. Bernardo Houssay, the first Latin American recipient, discovered the role of pituitary hormones in regulating glucose in animals, and shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1947. Luis Leloir discovered how organisms store energy converting glucose into glycogen and the compounds which are fundamental in metabolizing carbohydrates, receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1970. César Milstein did extensive research in antibodies, sharing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984. Argentine research has led to treatments for heart diseases and several forms of cancer. Domingo Liotta designed and developed the first artificial heart that was successfully implanted in a human being in 1969. René Favaloro developed the techniques and performed the world's first coronary bypass surgery.\n\nArgentina's nuclear programme has been highly successful. In 1957 Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build a research reactor with homegrown technology, the RA-1 Enrico Fermi. This reliance on the development of its own nuclear-related technologies, instead of buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina's nuclear programme conducted by the civilian National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA). Nuclear facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia and Egypt. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing weapon-grade uranium, a major step needed to assemble nuclear weapons; since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes.[273] As a member of the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Argentina has been a strong voice in support of nuclear non-proliferation efforts[274] and is highly committed to global nuclear security.[275]\n\nDespite its modest budget and numerous setbacks, academics and the sciences in Argentina have enjoyed international respect since the turn of the 1900s, when Luis Agote devised the first safe and effective means of blood transfusion as well as René Favaloro, who was a pioneer in the improvement of the coronary artery bypass surgery. Argentine scientists are still on the cutting edge in fields such as nanotechnology, physics, computer sciences, molecular biology, oncology, ecology and cardiology. Juan Maldacena, an Argentine-American scientist, is a leading figure in string theory.\n\nSpace research has also become increasingly active in Argentina. Argentine-built satellites include LUSAT-1 (1990), Víctor-1 (1996), PEHUENSAT-1 (2007),[276] and those developed by CONAE, the Argentine space agency, of the SAC series.[277] Argentina has its own satellite programme, nuclear power station designs (4th generation) and public nuclear energy company INVAP, which provides several countries with nuclear reactors.[278] Established in 1991, the CONAE has since launched two satellites successfully and,[279] in June 2009, secured an agreement with the European Space Agency for the installation of a 35-m diametre antenna and other mission support facilities at the Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's foremost cosmic ray observatory.[280] The facility will contribute to numerous ESA space probes, as well as CONAE's own, domestic research projects. Chosen from 20 potential sites and one of only three such ESA installations in the world, the new antenna will create a triangulation which will allow the ESA to ensure mission coverage around the clock[281] Argentina was ranked 76th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[282]\n\nThe 2022 census [INDEC] conducted by the counted 46,044,703 inhabitants, up from 40,117,096 in 2010.[10][283][284] Argentina ranks third in South America in total population, fourth in Latin America and 33rd globally. Its population density of 15 persons per square kilometre of land area is well below the world average of 50 persons. The population growth rate in 2010 was an estimated 1.03% annually, with a birth rate of 17.7 live births per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.4 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants. Since 2010, the crude net migration rate has ranged from below zero to up to four immigrants per 1,000 inhabitants per year.[285]\n\nArgentina is in the midst of a demographic transition to an older and slower-growing population. The proportion of people under 15 is 25.6%, a little below the world average of 28%, and the proportion of people 65 and older is relatively high at 10.8%. In Latin America, this is second only to Uruguay and well above the world average, which is currently 7%. Argentina has a comparatively low infant mortality rate. Its birth rate of 2.3 children per woman is considerably below the high of 7.0 children born per woman in 1895,[286] though still nearly twice as high as in Spain or Italy, which are culturally and demographically similar.[287][288] The median age is 31.9 years and life expectancy at birth is 77.14 years.[289]\n\nAttitudes towards LGBT people are generally positive within Argentina.[290] In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth worldwide to legalize same-sex marriage.[291][292]\n\nArgentina is considered a country of immigrants.[293][294][295] Argentines usually refer to the country as a crisol de razas (crucible of races, or melting pot). A 2010 study conducted on 218 individuals by the Argentine geneticist Daniel Corach established that the average genetic ancestry of Argentines is 79% European (mainly Italian and Spanish), 18% indigenous and 4.3% African; 63.6% of the tested group had at least one ancestor who was Indigenous.[296][297] The majority of Argentines descend from multiple European ethnic groups, primarily of Italian and Spanish descent, with over 25 million Argentines (almost 60% of the population) having some partial Italian origins.[298]\n\nArgentina is also home to a notable Asian population, the majority of whom are descended from either West Asians (namely Lebanese and Syrians)[299] or East Asians (such as the Chinese,[300] Koreans, and the Japanese).[301] The latter of whom number around 180,000 individuals. The total number of Arab Argentines (most of whom are of Lebanese or Syrian origin) is estimated to be 1.3 to 3.5 million. Many immigrated from various Asian countries to Argentina during the 19th century (especially during the latter half of the century) and the first half of the 20th century.[302][303] Most Arab Argentines belong to the Catholic Church (including both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches) or the Eastern Orthodox Church. A minority are Muslims. There are 180,000 Alawites in Argentina. [304][305]\n\nFrom the 1970s, immigration has mostly been coming from Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru, with smaller numbers from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Romania.[306] The Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a programme[307] to encourage illegal immigrants to declare their status in return for two-year residence visas—so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the programme.[308] As of July 2023, more than 18,500 Russians have come to Argentina after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[309]\n\nThe de facto[P] official language is Spanish, spoken by almost all Argentines. The country is the largest Spanish-speaking society that universally employs voseo, the use of the pronoun vos instead of tú (\"you\"), which imposes the use of alternative verb forms as well. Owing to the extensive Argentine geography, Spanish has a strong variation among regions, although the prevalent dialect is Rioplatense, primarily spoken in the Pampean and Patagonian regions and accented similarly to the Neapolitan language. Italian and other European immigrants influenced Lunfardo—the regional slang—permeating the vernacular vocabulary of other Latin American countries as well.\n\nThere are several second-languages in widespread use among the Argentine population: English (by 2.8 million people);[312] Italian (by 1.5 million people);[Q] Arabic (specially its Northern Levantine dialect, by one million people); Standard German (by 200,000 people);[R] Guaraní (by 200,000 people, mostly in Corrientes and Misiones);[3] Catalan (by 174,000 people); Quechua (by 65,000 people, mostly in the Northwest); Wichí (by 53,700 people, mainly in Chaco where, along with Kom and Moqoit, it is official de jure);[5] Vlax Romani (by 52,000 people); Albanian (by 40,000 people);[313] Japanese (by 32,000 people); Aymara (by 30,000 people, mostly in the Northwest); and Ukrainian (by 27,000 people).\n\nChristianity is the largest religion in Argentina. The Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. Although it enforces neither an official nor a state faith, it gives Roman Catholicism a preferential status.[S]\n\nAccording to a 2008 CONICET poll, Argentines were 76.5% Catholic, 11.3% Agnostics and Atheists, 9% Evangelical Protestants, 1.2% Jehovah's Witnesses, and 0.9% Mormons, while 1.2% followed other religions, including Islam, Judaism and Buddhism. These figures appear to have changed quite significantly in recent years: data recorded in 2017 indicated that Catholics made up 66% of the population, indicating a drop of 10.5% in nine years, and the nonreligious in the country standing at 21% of the population, indicating an almost doubling over the same period.[319]\n\nThe country is home to both one of the largest Muslim[317] and largest Jewish communities in Latin America, the latter being the seventh most populous in the world. Argentina is a member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.[317]\n\nArgentines show high individualization and de-institutionalization of religious beliefs; 23.8% claim to always attend religious services; 49.1% seldom do and 26.8% never do.\n\nOn 13 March 2013, Argentine Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the Cardinal Archbishop of Buenos Aires, was elected Bishop of Rome and Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church. He took the name \"Francis\", and he became the first Pope from either the Americas or from the Southern Hemisphere; he is the first Pope born outside of Europe since the election of Pope Gregory III (who was Syrian) in 741.[323]\n\nHealthcare is provided through a combination of employer and labour union-sponsored plans (Obras Sociales), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans. Healthcare cooperatives number over 300 (of which 200 are related to labour unions) and provide healthcare for half the population; the national INSSJP (popularly known as PAMI) covers nearly all of the five million senior citizens.[324]\n\nThere are more than 153,000 hospital beds, 121,000 physicians and 37,000 dentists (ratios comparable to developed nations).[325][326] The relatively high access to medical care has historically resulted in mortality patterns and trends similar to developed nations': from 1953 to 2005, deaths from cardiovascular disease increased from 20% to 23% of the total, those from tumors from 14% to 20%, respiratory problems from 7% to 14%, digestive maladies (non-infectious) from 7% to 11%, strokes a steady 7%, injuries, 6%, and infectious diseases, 4%. Causes related to senility led to many of the rest. Infant deaths have fallen from 19% of all deaths in 1953 to 3% in 2005.[325][327]\n\nThe availability of healthcare has also reduced infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948[328] to 12.1 in 2009[325] and raised life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76.[328] Though these figures compare favourably with global averages, they fall short of levels in developed nations and in 2006, Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America.[326]\n\nThe Argentine education system consists of four levels.[329] An initial level for children between 45 days to 5 years old, with the last two years[330] being compulsory. An elementary or lower school mandatory level lasting 6 or 7 years.[T] In 2010 the literacy rate was 98.07%.[331] A secondary or high school mandatory level lasting 5 or 6 years.[T] In 2010 38.5% of people over age 20 had completed secondary school.[332] A higher level, divided in tertiary, university and post-graduate sub-levels. in 2013 there were 47 national public universities across the country, as well as 46 private ones.[333]\n\nIn 2010 7.1% of people over age 20 had graduated from university.[332] The public universities of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, La Plata, Rosario, and the National Technological University are some of the most important. The Argentine state guarantees universal, secular and free-of-charge public education for all levels.[U] Responsibility for educational supervision is organized at the federal and individual provincial states. In the last decades the role of the private sector has grown across all educational stages.\n\nArgentina is highly urbanized, with 92% of its population living in cities:[334] the ten largest metropolitan areas account for half of the population. About 3 million people live in the city of Buenos Aires, and including the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area it totals around 13 million, making it one of the largest urban areas in the world.[335] The metropolitan areas of Córdoba and Rosario have around 1.3 million inhabitants each.[335] Mendoza, San Miguel de Tucumán, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe have at least half a million people each.[335]\n\nThe population is unequally distributed: about 60% live in the Pampas region (21% of the total area), including 15 million people in Buenos Aires province. The provinces of Córdoba and Santa Fe, and the city of Buenos Aires have 3 million each. Seven other provinces have over one million people each: Mendoza, Tucumán, Entre Ríos, Salta, Chaco, Corrientes and Misiones. With 64.3 inhabitants per square kilometre (167/sq mi), Tucumán is the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average; by contrast, the southern province of Santa Cruz has around 1.1/km2 (2.8/sq mi).[336]\n\nArgentina is a multicultural country with significant European influences. Modern Argentine culture has been largely influenced by Italian, Spanish and other European immigration from France, Russia, United Kingdom, among others. Its cities are largely characterized by both the prevalence of people of European descent, and of conscious imitation of American and European styles in fashion, architecture and design.[338] Museums, cinemas, and galleries are abundant in all the large urban centres, as well as traditional establishments such as literary bars, or bars offering live music of a variety of genres although there are lesser elements of Amerindian and African influences, particularly in the fields of music and art. The other big influence is the gauchos and their traditional country lifestyle of self-reliance. Finally, indigenous American traditions have been absorbed into the general cultural milieu. Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato has reflected on the nature of the culture of Argentina as follows:\n\nAlthough Argentina's rich literary history began around 1550, it reached full independence with Esteban Echeverría's El Matadero, a romantic landmark that played a significant role in the development of 19th century's Argentine narrative, split by the ideological divide between the popular, federalist epic of José Hernández' Martín Fierro and the elitist and cultured discourse of Sarmiento's masterpiece, Facundo.\n\nThe Modernist movement advanced into the 20th century including exponents such as Leopoldo Lugones and poet Alfonsina Storni; it was followed by Vanguardism, with Ricardo Güiraldes's Don Segundo Sombra as an important reference.\n\nJorge Luis Borges, Argentina's most acclaimed writer and one of the foremost figures in the history of literature, found new ways of looking at the modern world in metaphor and philosophical debate and his influence has extended to authors all over the globe. Short stories such as Ficciones and The Aleph are among his most famous works. He was a friend and collaborator of Adolfo Bioy Casares, who wrote one of the most praised science fiction novels, The Invention of Morel. Julio Cortázar, one of the leading members of the Latin American Boom and a major name in 20th century literature, influenced an entire generation of writers in the Americas and Europe.\n\nA remarkable episode in Argentine literary history is the social and literarial dialectica between the so-called Florida Group, named this way because its members used to meet together at the Richmond Cafeteria at Florida street and published in the Martín Fierro magazine, such as Jorge Luis Borges, Leopoldo Marechal, Antonio Berni (artist), among others; versus the Boedo Group of Roberto Arlt, Cesar Tiempo, Homero Manzi (tango composer), that used to meet at the Japanese Cafe and published their works with the Editorial Claridad, with both the cafe and the publisher located at Boedo Avenue.\n\nOther highly regarded Argentine writers, poets and essayists include Estanislao del Campo, Eugenio Cambaceres, Pedro Bonifacio Palacios, Hugo Wast, Benito Lynch, Enrique Banchs, Oliverio Girondo, Ezequiel Martínez Estrada, Victoria Ocampo, Leopoldo Marechal, Silvina Ocampo, Roberto Arlt, Eduardo Mallea, Manuel Mujica Láinez, Ernesto Sábato, Silvina Bullrich, Rodolfo Walsh, María Elena Walsh, Tomás Eloy Martínez, Manuel Puig, Alejandra Pizarnik, and Osvaldo Soriano.\n\nTango, a Rioplatense musical genre with European and African influences, is one of Argentina's international cultural symbols. The golden age of tango (1930 to mid-1950s) mirrored that of jazz and swing in the United States, featuring large orchestras such as those of Osvaldo Pugliese, Aníbal Troilo, Francisco Canaro, Julio de Caro and Juan d'Arienzo. After 1955, virtuoso Astor Piazzolla popularized Nuevo tango, a subtler and more intellectual trend for the genre. Tango enjoys worldwide popularity nowadays with groups such as Gotan Project, Bajofondo and Tanghetto.\n\nArgentina developed strong classical music and dance scenes that gave rise to renowned artists such as Alberto Ginastera, composer; Alberto Lysy, violinist; Martha Argerich and Eduardo Delgado, pianists; Daniel Barenboim, pianist and symphonic orchestra director; José Cura and Marcelo Álvarez, tenors; and to ballet dancers Jorge Donn, José Neglia, Norma Fontenla, Maximiliano Guerra, Paloma Herrera, Marianela Núñez, Iñaki Urlezaga and Julio Bocca.\n\nA national Argentine folk style emerged in the 1930s from dozens of regional musical genres and went on to influence the entirety of Latin American music. Some of its interpreters, such as Atahualpa Yupanqui and Mercedes Sosa, achieved worldwide acclaim. The romantic ballad genre included singers of international fame such as Sandro de América. Tenor saxophonist Leandro \"Gato\" Barbieri and composer and big band conductor Lalo Schifrin are among the most internationally successful Argentine jazz musicians.\n\nArgentine rock developed as a distinct musical style in the mid-1960s, when Buenos Aires and Rosario became cradles of aspiring musicians. Founding bands such as Los Gatos, Sui Generis, Almendra and Manal were followed by Seru Giran, Los Abuelos de la Nada, Soda Stereo and Patricio Rey y sus Redonditos de Ricota, with prominent artists including Gustavo Cerati, Litto Nebbia, Andrés Calamaro, Luis Alberto Spinetta, Charly García, Fito Páez and León Gieco.\n\nA dance and a musical genre popular at present is Cachengue, a subgenre of Argentine cumbia and reggaeton spreading in popularity in nearby countries such as Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, and Bolivia.[355]\n\nBuenos Aires is one of the great theatre capitals of the world,[358] with a scene of international caliber centred on Corrientes Avenue, \"the street that never sleeps\", sometimes referred to as the Broadway of Buenos Aires. Teatro Colón is a global landmark for opera and classical performances; its acoustics are considered among the world's top five.[V]\n\nThe Argentine film industry has historically been one of the three most developed in Latin American cinema, along with those produced in Mexico and Brazil.[361][362] Started in 1896; by the early 1930s it had already become Latin America's leading film producer, a place it kept until the early 1950s. The world's first animated feature films were made and released in Argentina, by cartoonist Quirino Cristiani, in 1917 and 1918.[364]\n\nArgentine films have achieved worldwide recognition: the country has won two Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film, for The Official Story (1985) and The Secret in Their Eyes (2009). In addition, Argentine composers Luis Enrique Bacalov and Gustavo Santaolalla have been honoured with Academy Awards for Best Original Score, and Armando Bó and Nicolás Giacobone shared in the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for 2014. Also, the Argentine French actress Bérénice Bejo received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2011 and won the César Award for Best Actress and won the Best Actress award in the Cannes Film Festival for her role in the film The Past.[365] Argentina also has won seventeen Goya Awards for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film, being by far the most awarded country in Latin America with twenty-four nominations. Many other Argentine films also have been acclaimed by international critique. In 2013 about 100 full-length motion pictures were being created annually.[366]\n\nSome of the best-known Argentine painters are Cándido López and Florencio Molina Campos (Naïve style); Ernesto de la Cárcova and Eduardo Sívori (Realism); Fernando Fader (Impressionism); Pío Collivadino, Atilio Malinverno and Cesáreo Bernaldo de Quirós (Postimpressionism); Emilio Pettoruti (Cubism); Julio Barragán (Concretism and Cubism) Antonio Berni (Neofigurativism); Roberto Aizenberg and Xul Solar (Surrealism); Gyula Košice (Constructivism); Eduardo Mac Entyre (Generative art); Luis Seoane, Carlos Torrallardona, Luis Aquino, Alfredo Gramajo Gutiérrez (Modernism); Lucio Fontana (Spatialism); Tomás Maldonado, Guillermo Kuitca (Abstract art); León Ferrari, Marta Minujín (Conceptual art); Gustavo Cabral (Fantasy art), and Fabián Pérez (Neoemotionalism).[vague]\n\nIn 1946 Gyula Košice and others created The Madí Movement in Argentina, which then spread to Europe and the United States, where it had a significant impact.[367] Tomás Maldonado was one of the main theorists of the Ulm Model of design education, still highly influential globally. Other Argentine artists of worldwide fame include Adolfo Bellocq, whose lithographs have been influential since the 1920s, and Benito Quinquela Martín, the quintessential port painter, inspired by the immigrant-bound La Boca neighbourhood. Internationally laureate sculptors Erminio Blotta, Lola Mora and Rogelio Yrurtia authored many of the classical evocative monuments of the Argentine cityscape.[citation needed]\n\nThe colonization brought the Spanish Baroque architecture, which can still be appreciated in its simpler Rioplatense style in the reduction of San Ignacio Miní, the Cathedral of Córdoba, and the Cabildo of Luján. Italian and French influences increased at the beginning of the 19th century with strong eclectic overtones that gave the local architecture a unique feeling.[368]\n\nThe print media industry is highly developed in Argentina, with more than two hundred newspapers. The major national ones include Clarín (centrist, Latin America's best-seller and the second most widely circulated in the Spanish-speaking world), La Nación (centre-right, published since 1870), Página/12 (leftist, founded in 1987), La Voz del Interior (centre, founded in 1904).\n\nArgentina began the world's first regular radio broadcasting on 27 August 1920, when Richard Wagner's Parsifal was aired by a team of medical students led by Enrique Telémaco Susini in Buenos Aires' Teatro Coliseo.[371] By 2002 there were 260 AM and 1150 FM registered radio stations in the country.[372]\n\nThe Argentine television industry is large, diverse and popular across Latin America, with many productions and TV formats having been exported abroad. Since 1999 Argentines enjoy the highest availability of cable and satellite television in Latin America,[373] as of 2014 totaling 87.4% of the country's households, a rate similar to those in the United States, Canada and Europe.[374]\n\nBy 2011 Argentina also had the highest coverage of networked telecommunications among Latin American powers: about 67% of its population had internet access and the ratio of mobile phone subscriptions to population was 137.2%.[375][better source needed]\n\nBesides many of the pasta, sausage and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, Argentines enjoy a wide variety of Indigenous and Criollo creations, including empanadas (a small stuffed pastry), locro (a mixture of corn, beans, meat, bacon, onion, and gourd), humita and mate. In various localities of Argentina, this dish is consumed as a beefmelt.\n\nThe country has the highest consumption of red meat in the world,[377] traditionally prepared as asado, the Argentine barbecue. It is made with various types of meats, often including chorizo, sweetbread, chitterlings, and blood sausage.\n\nCommon desserts include facturas (Viennese-style pastry), cakes and pancakes filled with dulce de leche (a sort of milk caramel jam), alfajores (shortbread cookies sandwiched together with chocolate, dulce de leche or a fruit paste), and tortas fritas (fried cakes)\n\nArgentine wine, one of the world's finest,[380] is an integral part of the local menu. Malbec, Torrontés, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Chardonnay are some of the most sought-after varieties.\n\nPato is the national sport,[382] an ancient horseback game locally originated in the early 1600s and predecessor of horseball.[384]\n\nThe most popular sport is football. Along with Brazil, Germany and France, the men's national team is the only one to have won each of the World Cup (in 1978, 1986 and 2022), Confederations Cup, and the Olympic gold. They have also won 16 Copas América, 7 Pan American Gold Medals and many other trophies. Alfredo Di Stéfano, Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi are widely considered to be among the best players in the game's history.\n\nThe country's women's field hockey team Las Leonas, is one of the world's most successful with four Olympic medals, two World Cups, a World League and seven Champions Trophy. Luciana Aymar is recognized as the best female player in the history of the sport,[388] being the only player to have received the FIH Player of the Year Award eight times.[389]\n\nBasketball is a very popular sport. The men's national team is the only one in the FIBA Americas zone that has won the quintuplet crown: World Championship, Olympic Gold Medal, Diamond Ball, Americas Championship, and Pan American Gold Medal. It has also conquered 13 South American Championships, and many other tournaments.[390] Emanuel Ginóbili, Luis Scola, Andrés Nocioni, Fabricio Oberto, Pablo Prigioni, Carlos Delfino and Juan Ignacio Sánchez are a few of the country's most acclaimed players, all of them part of the NBA. Argentina hosted the Basketball World Cup in 1950 and 1990.\n\nRugby is another popular sport in Argentina. As of 2017 , the men's national team, known as 'Los Pumas' has competed at the Rugby World Cup each time it has been held, achieving their highest-ever result in 2007 when they came third. Since 2012, the Los Pumas have competed against Australia, New Zealand & South Africa in The Rugby Championship, the premier international Rugby competition in the Southern Hemisphere. Since 2009 the secondary men's national team known as the 'Jaguares' has competed against the US, Canada, and Uruguay first teams in the Americas Rugby Championship, which Los Jaguares have won six out of eight times it has taken place.\n\nArgentina has produced some of the most formidable champions for boxing, including Carlos Monzón, the best middleweight in history;[391] Pascual Pérez, one of the most decorated flyweight boxers of all times; Horacio Accavallo, the former WBA and WBC world flyweight champion; Víctor Galíndez, as of 2009 , record holder for consecutive world light heavyweight title defences and Nicolino Locche, nicknamed \"The Untouchable\" for his masterful defence; they are all inductees into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nTennis has been quite popular among people of all ages. Guillermo Vilas is the greatest Latin American player of the Open Era, while Gabriela Sabatini is the most accomplished Argentine female player of all time—having reached number 3 in the WTA ranking, are both inductees into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.[395] Argentina has won the World Team Cup four times, in 1980, 2002, 2007 and 2010 and has reached the semifinals of the Davis Cup 7 times in the last 10 years, losing the finals against Russia in 2006 and Spain in 2008 and 2011; the Argentine team also played the final in 1981, where they lost against the United States. The national squad won the 2016 Davis Cup.\n\nArgentina reigns undisputed in polo, having won more international championships than any other country and been seldom beaten since the 1930s. The Argentine Polo Championship is the sport's most important international team trophy. The country is home to most of the world's top players, among them Adolfo Cambiaso, the best in Polo history.\n\nHistorically, Argentina has had a strong showing within auto racing. Juan Manuel Fangio was a five-time Formula One world champion under four different teams, winning 102 of his 184 international races, and is widely ranked as the greatest driver of all time. Other distinguished racers were Oscar Alfredo Gálvez, Juan Gálvez, José Froilán González and Carlos Reutemann.\n• None Margheritis, Ana (2010).

Su dominio en materia nuclear y espacial le ha permitido diseñar, construir y exportar satélites, radares, reactores nucleares, aviones de combate, helicópteros, etc. Lidera en exportación de automóviles, software, biotecnología, equipamiento médico, maquinaria, ingeniería y tecnología agrícola, etc. Tiene capacidad para alimentar a 800 millones de personas y es uno de los principales agroexportadores a nivel mundial.\n\nAsí mismo, ha hecho contribuciones significativas en deportes, música, literatura, cine y política. El baypass coronario, las huellas digitales, la transfusión sanguínea, la birome, la jeringa descartable, los dibujos animados y el primer diseño funcional de los helicópteros modernos, son los inventos argentinos más reconocidos en el globo.[18]​[19]​[20]​\n\nArgentina integra el G20 —bloque que reúne a las naciones más ricas e industrializadas del planeta— y es miembro fundador del Mercosur, de Naciones Unidas, la Organización de Estados Americanos y el NIC o nuevos países industrializados.[21]​\n\nSu territorio bicontinental abarca una superficie de 2 780 400 km²,[3]​ es el país hispanohablante más extenso del planeta, el segundo más grande de América Latina y octavo en el mundo, si se considera solo la superficie continental sujeta a soberanía efectiva. Su plataforma continental, reconocida por la ONU en 2016, alcanza los 6 581 500 km²,[22]​ convirtiéndose en una de las más grandes del mundo,[23]​ extendiéndose desde el continente americano hasta el Polo Sur en la Antártida, a través del Atlántico Sur. Si se cuentan las islas Malvinas, Georgias del Sur, Sandwich del Sur y otras numerosas islas menores (administradas por el Reino Unido, pero de soberanía en litigio), más una porción del área antártica llamada Antártida Argentina al sur del paralelo 60° S, sobre la cual Argentina reclama soberanía, la superficie se eleva a 3 761 274 km².[24]​ Es una de las veinte naciones con presencia continua en la Antártida y posee la mayor cantidad de bases permanentes, con seis en total.\n\nSu territorio reúne una gran diversidad de climas, causada por una amplitud latitudinal que supera los 30° —incluyendo varias zonas geoastronómicas—, una diferencia en la altitud que va de 107 m bajo el nivel del mar (Laguna del Carbón) a casi 7000 m s. n. m. y la extensión del litoral marítimo que alcanza 4725 km. Amplias llanuras húmedas limitan con extensos desiertos y altas montañas, mientras que la presencia de climas tropicales y subtropicales en el norte, contrastan con las nevadas y fríos extremos en las zonas cordilleranas y el sur.\n\nLos primeros registros de pobladores en el actual territorio argentino se remontan a los trece mil años AP, durante el Paleoamericano. En tiempos protohistóricos, periodo precolombino, fue habitado por numerosos pueblos indígenas, algunos de los cuales aún habitan el país; entre ellos guaycurúes, guaraníes, mapuches, tehuelches y diaguitas, estos últimos formaban parte del Imperio incaico. La conquista española del actual territorio argentino comenzó con viajes exploratorios desde el año 1512, el establecimiento de una población en 1528 y la distribución del territorio a los adelantados. Más tarde, quedó bajo la jurisdicción del virreinato del Perú. En 1776, la Corona española fundó el virreinato del Río de la Plata, el cual sería una entidad política precedente a la actual República Argentina. El 25 de mayo de 1810 fue sustituido el sistema virreinal, deponiendo al último virrey que gobernó desde Buenos Aires,[25]​ organizándose así la Primera Junta de gobierno, que actuaba de forma autónoma desconociendo al Consejo de Regencia de España. El día 9 de julio de 1816 fue proclamada la independencia en San Miguel de Tucumán.[26]​\n\nEl nombre oficial del país es República Argentina, literalmente, «República del Plata». Por elipsis, suele denominarse, «la Argentina». El uso sin artículo está muy extendido y no se considera incorrecto,[27]​ si bien la Academia Argentina de Letras lo ha calificado de «reprensible».[28]​\n\nArgentina es el femenino del adjetivo poético «argentino» que indica algo que tiene cualidades de la plata o relacionado con ella,[29]​ del latín argentum (‘plata’).[30]​ Argentum, a su vez, procede del protoitálico: *argentom, derivado del protoindoeuropeo: *h₂r̥ǵn̥tóm, sustantivo formado a partir del adjetivo *h₂erǵ- (‘blanco’, ‘brillante’).[31]​[32]​[33]​[34]​\n\nArgentina fue una denominación poética de los países ribereños del Plata,[35]​ río llamado así porque era un acceso a los yacimientos argentíferos del Alto Perú, donde la ciudad de La Plata (Charcas, actual Sucre) era también llamada Civitas Argentina (Ciudad Argentina).[36]​\n\nEl uso como topónimo, aunque con una declinación diferente, aparece por primera vez en 1554 en el mapa de Lopo Homem: donde los territorios de la región litoral son llamados: Terra Argentea.[37]​ Más tarde, Martín del Barco Centenera la eligió, a imitación de La Araucana (1569), como título de un poema épico sobre la conquista: La Argentina (1602).[27]​ Desde entonces y hasta finales del siglo XVIII, Argentina y argentino fueron denominaciones literarias del territorio y los pobladores de la región rioplatense.[27]​\n\nCon la creación del Virreinato del Río de la Plata y su posterior independencia como Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata, Argentina y argentino se hicieron más comunes, aunque a veces con una connotación restringida a Buenos Aires y las provincias cercanas.[27]​\n\nLa Constitución de 1826, usó Argentina como nombre oficial del Estado y, desde entonces, a pesar del rechazo a dicha constitución, fue usado de manera habitual. A partir de la década de 1830, Rosas, formalmente gobernador de Buenos Aires, era el «encargado de dirigir las relaciones exteriores de la República Argentina».[36]​\n\nLa reforma constitucional argentina de 1860 sancionó como artículo 35 la norma que estableció los nombres oficiales del país, vigente desde entonces:\n\nEn 1860, en la ciudad de Paraná, entonces capital de la Confederación Argentina, el presidente Santiago Derqui decretó que para «uniformar los actos administrativos» se usaría siempre República Argentina.[38]​ Dos años más tarde, en 1862, Bartolomé Mitre, primer presidente del país reunificado, se refirió a su cargo como: presidente de la Nación Argentina.[39]​\n\nLa Primera Junta de Gobierno, oficialmente Junta Provisional Gubernativa de las Provincias del Río de la Plata a nombre del Señor Don Fernando VII fue la Junta de gobierno surgida el viernes 25 de mayo de 1810 en Buenos Aires, capital del Virreinato del Río de la Plata, como consecuencia del triunfo de la Revolución de Mayo que destituyó al virrey Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros y nombró a Cornelio Saavedra como el presidente de la Primera Junta de las Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata. La sede del gobierno fue fijada en el Fuerte de Buenos Aires, que sirviera desde 1776 como residencia de los virreyes y donde hoy se encuentra la Casa de Gobierno. La Primera Junta existió como tal hasta el 18 de diciembre del mismo año, ya que con la incorporación de diputados del interior se transformó en la Junta Grande, que dio origen a la prolongada Guerra de la Independencia de las Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata contra España (1810-1824).\n\nMientras se desarrollaba la guerra de independencia, también tenía lugar una compleja disputa por la forma de organización del nuevo Estado, que generó en 1814 el inicio de una guerra civil que —con intermitencias— duraría más de medio siglo. El líder de la fracción federal, el oriental José Gervasio Artigas fue proclamado Protector de la Unión de los Pueblos Libres, una liga de provincias que se negaban a ser administrados por el gobierno unitario de Buenos Aires. La misma organizó el llamado Congreso de Oriente en Concepción del Uruguay, del cual aún se discute si alcanzó a proclamar —como se proponía— la independencia de España.[57]​\n\nEl 9 de julio de 1816, en la ciudad de San Miguel de Tucumán, reunido el congreso de diputados de las provincias del noroeste y centro-oeste del país y de la de Buenos Aires, junto con algunos diputados exiliados del Alto Perú,[m]​ proclamó la independencia de las Provincias Unidas en Sud América, utilizando la siguiente fórmula:[58]​\n\nEn varios puntos de Sudamérica los nuevos gobiernos debieron enfrentar la resistencia contrarrevolucionaria de los ejércitos realistas, que intentaban restaurar la autoridad de la monarquía española en la región. Comenzaron las guerras por la independencia. Algunos de los principales comandantes fueron Manuel Belgrano, al mando del Ejército del Norte, José de San Martín, creador del Ejército de los Andes, Martín Miguel de Güemes, organizador de la guerra gaucha y Juana Azurduy, comandante de la guerra de guerrillas en el Alto Perú. El Estado argentino considera a San Martín como el mayor héroe militar de su independencia y lo honra con el título de «Padre de la Patria». Junto a Simón Bolívar, fueron los máximos responsables de las gestas libertadoras que terminaron con la presencia española en el continente.\n\nLa formación del Estado federal\n\nLas primeras décadas como país independiente fueron conflictivas: ante la hegemonía de los unitarios, los federales se alzaron repetidamente en defensa de la autonomía de las provincias, llevando —tras la llamada Anarquía del Año XX— a la división del país en provincias autónomas gobernadas generalmente por caudillos militares, mientras que el país —excepto un breve intervalo entre 1825 y 1827— careció de un gobierno nacional hasta 1852. Cada provincia asumió la plenitud del gobierno en el ámbito de su territorio.\n\nLa guerra de la independencia continuó hasta el año 1825, pero se luchó preferentemente en la frontera norte y en el Perú. Mientras tanto, la Provincia Oriental fue invadida por el reino de Portugal, de quien pasó al Imperio del Brasil. La consecuente guerra del Brasil culminó con la Convención Preliminar de Paz de 1828, que declaró independiente al territorio en disputa, con el nombre de Estado Oriental del Uruguay.[59]​ Poco antes, en 1825, el Alto Perú formó la República de Bolivia y al año siguiente le fue agregada la ciudad de Tarija y su jurisdicción.\n\nEl territorio restante —que había logrado aumentar en algo su control territorial con algunas exitosas campañas militares contra los indígenas— comenzó a usar el nombre de «Argentina» de manera oficial a mediados de la década de 1820. La denominación oficial «Provincias Unidas del Río de la Plata» continúa considerándose, constitucionalmente, un nombre alternativo para el país, aunque ha caído en práctico desuso.[60]​\n\nA principios de los años 1830, los federales lograron triunfar en todo el país, que adoptó el nombre de Confederación Argentina. Durante más de veinte años, el gobernador federal de Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, asumió en los hechos la máxima autoridad nacional, aunque en teoría solo era el depositario de la representación externa del conjunto de las provincias. ​\n\nDurante la época de su hegemonía combatió y derrotó sucesivos levantamientos de los unitarios,[o]​ un bloqueo del Río de la Plata por parte de Francia y luego otro bloqueo conjunto por parte de Gran Bretaña y Francia. También mantuvo conflictos bélicos contra la Confederación Perú-Boliviana y contra el llamado Gobierno de la Defensa de Montevideo, la capital uruguaya, debido a la injerencia de los dos partidos de ese país —blancos y colorados— en las guerras civiles argentinas.\n\nPese a la paz que fue capaz de imponer y el crecimiento económico —al menos de las provincias del Litoral—, los enemigos de Rosas reclamaban libertades individuales, políticas y de expresión, que eran férreamente anuladas por el gobernador porteño; el núcleo de sus reclamos era la sanción de una constitución política que organizara formalmente el Estado nacional y garantizara los derechos de los ciudadanos.\n\nEn 1852, Rosas fue derrotado en la batalla de Caseros por el Ejército Grande, una alianza entre las provincias de Entre Ríos y Corrientes, las tropas coloradas de Uruguay y otras de Brasil. La alianza fue encabezada por el federal antirrosista Justo José de Urquiza, gobernador de Entre Ríos, quien asumió la presidencia provisional.[62]​\n\nEste período duró hasta la sanción de una Constitución en 1853, que con algunos cambios ha regido en el país hasta la actualidad. La misma adoptó un régimen federal, pero la provincia de Buenos Aires se separó de la Confederación Argentina, que debió establecer su capital en la ciudad de Paraná. En 1859, la Confederación derrotó a Buenos Aires en la batalla de Cepeda, forzándola a firmar el Pacto de San José de Flores, por el cual Buenos Aires se reincorporaba a la que desde entonces pasó a llamarse República Argentina. No obstante, la reunificación definitiva fue lograda bajo la dirección de Buenos Aires tras la batalla de Pavón (1861), durante la presidencia de Bartolomé Mitre.\n\nEn 1865, la Argentina se involucró nuevamente en una guerra civil en Uruguay, a lo cual el Paraguay respondió ocupando la ciudad de Corrientes. Tras firmar una Triple Alianza con el Brasil y Uruguay,[63]​ la Argentina tomó parte en la guerra de la Triple Alianza contra el Paraguay, que duró cinco años y requirió la participación de diez mil soldados argentinos.[64]​ El Paraguay resultó finalmente derrotado en 1870, quedando totalmente devastado y muerta una gran parte de su población masculina.[65]​ Pese a su enorme costo económico y en vidas humanas y a que fue causa de la continuación de las guerras civiles en la Argentina, este país logró consolidar sus límites en el noreste, ya que se fijó la frontera en los ríos Pilcomayo, Paraguay y Paraná.[65]​\n\nDurante las presidencias de Mitre y sobre todo de Sarmiento y Avellaneda, la Argentina se insertó en la economía mundial como un país agroexportador, sostenido por una amplia red ferroviaria y el avance del sistema educativo. Tras dos sangrientas revoluciones en 1874 y 1880, en este último año la ciudad de Buenos Aires fue federalizada y se estableció un equilibrio durable entre las provincias y la capital.\n\nEntre 1878 y 1884 se produjeron las llamadas Conquista del Desierto y del Chaco, con el objeto de dar por término a los constantes enfrentamientos entre indígenas y criollos en la frontera y apropiarse de los territorios indígenas, triplicando el territorio argentino. La primera conquista, impulsada por Julio A. Roca, consistió en una serie de incursiones militares a los territorios pampeanos y patagónicos dominados por los pueblos originarios, repartiéndolos entre los miembros de la Sociedad Rural, financiadores de las expediciones.[66]​ La conquista del Chaco duró hasta fines del siglo,[67]​ dado que su incorporación plena al sistema económico nacional solo tuvo lugar cuando se reemplazó la mera extracción de maderas y tanino por la producción de algodón. El gobierno argentino consideró a los indígenas como seres inferiores, sin los mismos derechos que los criollos y europeos.[68]​\n\nEntre 1880 y 1916, el Partido Autonomista Nacional (PAN) monopolizó el poder sobre la base de elecciones fraudulentas, propiciado por el sistema del voto cantado y durante 25 años, la figura excluyente fue el general Julio Argentino Roca. La llamada República Conservadora o República Oligárquica organizó un exitoso y moderno modelo agroexportador basado en la llamada división internacional del trabajo impuesta por el Imperio británico, orientado principalmente a la producción de carne y granos con destino al mercado británico. En el relato tradicional el país fue visto en esa época como «el granero del mundo».[69]​\n\nEste modelo económico generó una concentración de la riqueza en pocas manos y la exclusión social de las clases trabajadoras y de las poblaciones asentadas fuera de la región pampeana. La economía alcanzó altos niveles de crecimiento que atrajeron una gran corriente inmigratoria principalmente constituida por millones de italianos y españoles y en menor medida de seguidos de europeos orientales y asiáticos occidentales. La población argentina, que representaba el 0.13 % de la población mundial en 1869, pasaría a representar el 0.55 % en 1930, proporción en la que, aproximadamente, se estabilizaría desde entonces.[70]​\n\nLa prosperidad de la economía impulsó el crecimiento de una considerable clase media, integrada mayoritariamente por inmigrantes o sus descendientes. Los inmigrantes europeos también introdujeron en el país ideas políticas nuevas como el socialismo y el anarquismo, así como participaron junto a la población local, especialmente la afroargentina, en la creación de organizaciones de ayuda mutua y sindicatos.[71]​ ​ Surgieron partidos políticos modernos como la Unión Cívica Radical (UCR) y el Partido Socialista (PS).\n\nDespués de más de dos décadas de conflictos políticos y sociales, fraudes electorales y graves actos de represión, en 1912 fue sancionada la Ley Sáenz Peña, que estableció el sufragio secreto, obligatorio y universal para votantes masculinos. En la primera elección presidencial con sufragio secreto, los conservadores fueron desplazados del poder por los radicales dirigidos por Hipólito Yrigoyen, que fue presidente entre 1916 y 1922, y entre 1928 y 1930. Durante su primer gobierno se inició el movimiento estudiantil conocido como la reforma universitaria, que se extendió por toda América Latina y se produjeron las masacres obreras de la Semana Trágica y la Patagonia rebelde. Entre ambos gobiernos de Yrigoyen fue elegido presidente el también radical Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear.\n\nAlternancia entre golpes de estado y regímenes democráticos\n\nEl 6 de septiembre de 1930 se produjo el primero de una serie de golpes de Estado en Argentina que llevó a un grupo cívico-militar a establecer una dictadura justificada por la Corte Suprema como «gobierno de facto», después de derrocar a Hipólito Yrigoyen. Este golpe de Estado inició una secuela de gobiernos fraudulentos conocidos como la Década Infame.[p]​\n\nEl modelo agroexportador argentino entró en crisis por el cierre de los mercados internacionales causado por la Crisis de 1929. El país impulsó un proceso de sustitución de importaciones que desarrolló un amplio sector industrial.[73]​ La Década Infame fue derrocada por la Revolución del 43, un segundo golpe de Estado que instaló un gobierno militar en cuyo seno se produciría una alianza entre sindicatos y algunos militares que dieron origen al peronismo. A pesar de la presión de Estados Unidos desde que este país entró a la guerra a fines de 1941 cuando fue atacado por Japón, la Argentina se mantuvo neutral durante la mayor parte del resto de la II Guerra Mundial, uniéndose a los Aliados el 27 de marzo de 1945, durante el gobierno del general Edelmiro Farrell, poco antes de la terminación de la Guerra.\n\nEn 1946 fue elegido presidente Juan Domingo Perón con apoyo de los sindicatos organizados en el Partido Laborista. Perón, acompañado por su esposa Evita, encabezó un nuevo movimiento que puso el acento en la justicia social, la soberanía política y la independencia económica. Bajo su gobierno se estableció el sufragio femenino en 1947, la igualdad de hombres y mujeres en el derecho familiar, la igualdad de los hijos nacidos dentro o fuera del matrimonio, la gratuidad de la enseñanza universitaria, se erradicó el paludismo, etc.[74]​\n\nA través de la Fundación Eva Perón, se desarrolló una ayuda social sin precedentes en el país, brindando apoyo económico a los sectores más vulnerables. También se nacionalizaron los ferrocarriles y el comercio exterior, y se generó un fuerte proceso de industrialización, promoviendo la industria pesada.\n\nEn 1951 Perón fue reelegido para un nuevo período presidencial con el 63,40 % de los votos en lo que constituyó la primera elección con sufragio universal de hombres y mujeres en la Argentina. En 1952 murió Evita. Casi 60 años después, sería declarada la Mujer del Bicentenario, como el símbolo del protagonismo de la mujer en la historia argentina.[74]​ El peronismo contó con una amplia adhesión de la población, pero también con un fuerte rechazo de los sectores opositores, polarizándose la sociedad argentina en peronistas y antiperonistas. Su política perjudicó a los intereses británicos, dominantes hasta entonces en la economía, que apoyaron a los opositores.[75]​ El inicio de un conflicto con la Iglesia católica debilitó la lealtad al gobierno de vastos sectores y unificó a la oposición.[76]​\n\nEl 16 de junio de 1955 una conjura cívico-militar, utilizando unos treinta aviones de la Armada y de la Fuerza Aérea, bombardearon y ametrallaron a la población de Buenos Aires en la plaza de Mayo y otros lugares.[77]​ Este ataque produjo 308 víctimas oficialmente identificadas —entre ellas 111 activistas sindicales que incluyen a 23 mujeres—, un número de muertos que no pudieron ser individualizados debido a las mutilaciones y más de 700 heridos.[78]​\n\nEn septiembre Perón fue derrocado por un nuevo golpe autodenominado Revolución Libertadora, que proscribió al peronismo, muchos de cuyos partidarios fueron encarcelados o fusilados, lo que le valió al golpismo el mote de «Revolución Fusiladora». Perón se vio obligado a exiliarse hasta el final de la proscripción en 1973.[75]​\n\nDurante la proscripción, el peronismo continuará teniendo influencia en la política y el sindicalismo —ámbito en el que ganó la mayoría de las elecciones—, negando legitimidad a las autoridades instaladas por medios no democráticos y desarrollando una actividad opositora conocida por la Resistencia peronista.\n\nEn 1958 fue elegido presidente Arturo Frondizi (UCRI) en elecciones con el peronismo proscripto pero después de realizar un pacto electoral con Perón, siendo derrocado por un nuevo golpe militar en 1962. El golpe esta vez tuvo la particularidad de que el poder fue asumido por el civil José María Guido, nombrado presidente por la Corte Suprema de Justicia ese mismo día tras el derrocamiento y arresto de Frondizi, alegando para su nombramiento un vacío de poder. A pesar de que formalmente Guido ejercía la presidencia, el verdadero poder material residía en la esfera militar. Durante su mandato se agudizaron los enfrentamientos entre dos facciones del Ejército Argentino, conocidas como Azules y Colorados, llegándose a enfrentamientos armados. La victoria del sector «azul» permitió al general Juan Carlos Onganía reunificar al Ejército.\n\nCon el peronismo todavía proscripto y el expresidente Frondizi detenido,[79]​ en 1963 fue elegido como mandatario Arturo Umberto Illia (UCRP), quien también sería depuesto por un golpe militar en 1966, que llevaría al gobierno a Onganía.\n\nSu dictadura, la primera de las tres que conformaron la autodenominada Revolución Argentina (1966-1973), fue también la primera dictadura permanente instalada en el marco de los regímenes militares que se multiplicaron en América Latina con apoyo activo de Estados Unidos a través de la Escuela de las Américas y la doctrina de la seguridad nacional en el marco global de la Guerra Fría. La abolición de la actividad política y el terrorismo de Estado, provocó un estado insurreccional de la población que se manifestó en la aparición de varias organizaciones guerrilleras —como Montoneros, las FAR y el ERP— y gran cantidad de puebladas insurreccionales, como el Cordobazo, el Rosariazo y el Tucumanazo, entre otras.[80]​ Acorralada por la insurrección popular, la dictadura organizó una salida electoral con participación del peronismo —aunque impidiendo la candidatura de Perón—.\n\nEn 1973 el peronismo fue legalizado y triunfó en las elecciones presidenciales, dando inicio a lo que ha dado en llamarse el tercer peronismo. Tras la renuncia del presidente Héctor José Cámpora, ese mismo año, Juan Domingo Perón fue elegido presidente por tercera vez, precipitando así su muerte nueve meses después. Lo sucedió su vicepresidenta y esposa, María Estela Martínez de Perón. Este período se caracterizó por un acelerado deterioro de la situación interna, producto de la crisis del petróleo de 1973 y la generalizada violencia política, incluyendo la organización desde el gobierno de una fuerza parapolicial llamada la Alianza Anticomunista Argentina (Triple A) que junto a las fuerzas policiales y militares, asesinaron a cientos de opositores desde 1973 —varios de ellos «detenidos desaparecidos»—, así como la instalación de centros clandestinos de detención en el marco de la represión ordenada por los llamados decretos de aniquilamiento.[81]​\n\nEl 24 de marzo de 1976 se produjo un nuevo golpe militar que instaló una nueva dictadura permanente autodenominada Proceso de Reorganización Nacional, que duraría casi ocho años y que estaría internacionalmente coordinada con las demás dictaduras sudamericanas mediante el Plan Cóndor, bajo el amparo de Estados Unidos. Durante la misma se implantó un régimen de terrorismo de Estado que llevó a cabo un plan sistemático de secuestro, tortura y eliminación de opositores, calificado por la justicia de genocidio, causando miles desaparecidos y cientos de niños que sufrieron la supresión de su identidad.\n\nComo respuesta se formaron organizaciones de derechos humanos, como las Madres de Plaza de Mayo y las Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, que desempeñarán un rol crucial en el «juicio y castigo a los culpables» y en la recuperación de los bebés secuestrados cuya identidad había sido suprimida. También el movimiento sindical opuso una fuerte resistencia, llegando a declarar varias huelgas generales, a pesar de las desapariciones que lo afectaron masivamente, la disolución de la CGT y la intervención de los sindicatos.\n\nLa dictadura contó con apoyo activo de los principales grupos empresariales, ocupando funciones claves del gobierno, así como del Fondo Monetario Internacional, las empresas multinacionales, los principales medios de prensa, junto a periodistas y comunicadores destacados. El plan económico siguió los lineamientos de la Escuela de Chicago —frecuentemente identificada con el neoliberalismo—. Un sector importante de la población apoyó la dictadura, en tanto que otro sector la resistió mediante la acción guerrillera, la creación de organizaciones de derechos humanos como las Madres de Plaza de Mayo, o la acción sindical y las huelgas.\n\nLa deuda externa, que condicionará a los gobiernos democráticos a partir de 1983, pasó de 7700 millones en 1976 a 45 000 millones de dólares en 1983, en muchos casos fruto de operaciones delictivas en beneficio de los grupos económicos y las empresas multinacionales. En 1978, se produjo una grave crisis con Chile por los límites en la zona del canal Beagle, que llevó a ambos países al borde de la guerra. En 1982 se desarrolló la guerra de las Malvinas con el Reino Unido; la derrota argentina fue uno de los factores que llevaron al colapso del régimen militar y al llamado a elecciones generales para el año siguiente.\n\nEl 10 de diciembre de 2023 asumió el presidente electo Javier Milei como presidente de Argentina en el Palacio del Congreso de la Nación Argentina. Donde recibió la banda y bastón del expresidente Alberto Fernández.[127]​\n\nLa seguridad de las aguas territoriales corresponde a la Prefectura Naval Argentina (PNA), la de regiones fronterizas y obras de infraestructura críticas a la Gendarmería Nacional Argentina (GNA) y la de los aeropuertos a la Policía de Seguridad Aeroportuaria (PSA); estas fuerzas de seguridad dependen del Ministerio de Seguridad.\n\nEl Sistema de Inteligencia Nacional dirige las acciones de inteligencia, dentro de los que se destaca la Agencia Federal de Inteligencia (AFI), aunque también existen diferentes organismos públicos como la Dirección de Observaciones Judiciales, el Departamento de Intercepción y Captación de las Comunicaciones, la Inteligencia de la Gendarmería Nacional, la Oficina Anticorrupción, entre otras.[170]​\n\nCada provincia cuenta con su propia policía, que puede trabajar en conjunto con la PFA la fuerza de seguridad que se encarga de los delitos de ámbito exclusivamente federal o que involucran a más de una jurisdicción. La Policía Federal fue hasta 2009 la fuerza policial de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, cuando el entonces jefe de Gobierno porteño Mauricio Macri creó la Policía Metropolitana de Buenos Aires, la misma fue creada en el marco de la ley n.º 2894, de Seguridad Pública, que fue sancionada el 28 de octubre de 2008 y promulgada por medio del decreto 1354 del 18 de noviembre de ese año. La reglamentación de la norma se registró el 20 de marzo de 2009 por medio del decreto 210.[171]​\n\nEn su Constitución, Argentina establece la jerarquía constitucional de los tratados de derechos humanos.[172]​\n\nDe acuerdo con el Informe sobre Desarrollo Humano del Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo de 2018, la Argentina tiene un Índice de Desarrollo Humano (IDH) de 0,825. A nivel mundial, se sitúa en el puesto 47 dentro de los 189 estados que participan en la clasificación, encasillado como un país de IDH muy alto que junto con Chile y Uruguay son los únicos países de América Latina que se encuentran en este nivel de IDH.[173]​\n\nEn materia de derechos humanos, respecto a la pertenencia a los siete organismos de la Carta Internacional de Derechos Humanos, que incluyen al Comité de Derechos Humanos (HRC), Argentina ha firmado o ratificado:\n\nRegiones para el desarrollo económico y social\n• Vista de la Quebrada de Cafayate , en el punto denominado Tres Cruces.\n• , en el , en el Glaciar Perito Moreno , en el Parque nacional Los Glaciares , sur de Argentina.\n• Las Cataratas del Iguazú se encuentran más de un 80 % en territorio argentino , fueron declaradas como Patrimonio de la Humanidad por la UNESCO y son una de las Siete maravillas naturales del mundo\n• Glaciar Perito Moreno, Parque nacional Los Glaciares, .

Sin embargo, Argentina tiene deficiencias de infraestructura para llevar a cabo la transmisión de energía eléctrica desde áreas deshabitadas y con mucho viento hacia los grandes centros del país.[484]​\n\nLa generación de energía eléctrica alcanzó los 129 815 GWh en 2014, lo que representa un crecimiento de algo más del 40 % respecto de los 91 845 GWh registrados en 2004. El 64 % se generó en plantas térmicas, el 31 % hidráulicas, el 4 % nucleares y solamente el 1 % eólicas y solares.[485]​\n\nEl desarrollo de instalaciones de generación de energía a partir de recursos renovables se encuentra en pleno desarrollo. Hacia finales del año 2014, existía una potencia instalada de 187 MW de generación de energía eólica en la región patagónica y noroeste argentino y 8 MW de generación de energía solar en la región cuyana.[486]​\n\nArgentina cuenta con gran potencial de generación de energía mareomotriz, dadas las condiciones de las corrientes y la amplitud de mareas de la costa patagónica.[487]​ En diciembre de 2014, se instalaron en la provincia de Santa Cruz los primeros dos equipos para la obtención de datos sobre la potencialidad de este recurso.[488]​\n\nEsta Nación fue la primera en América latina en construir una central nuclear, actualmente cuenta con tres campos nucleares (Atucha I «Juan Domingo Perón», Atucha II «Dr Néstor Kirchner» y «Embalse») y una cuarta en período de construcción.[489]​\n\nEl desarrollo de la energía geotérmica prácticamente no presenta avances destacables, pese a la presencia de afluentes termales y la evidencia de actividad volcánica potencial en diversos puntos del país.[490]​\n\nEl transporte de energía eléctrica se desarrolla a través de una red de líneas de alta tensión y distribución troncal de 33 453 km de longitud lo que representa un incremento de más del 65 % en la longitud del sistema de redes existente en 2004.[485]​\n\nLa distribución de energía eléctrica está a cargo de empresas que, a fines del año 2014 sumaban más de 40 entidades, cubriendo un área de 2 262 664 km², lo que representa algo más del 80 % de la superficie del país y proporcionando el servicio a 13 496 085 usuarios de pequeños consumos (demanda menor a 4000 kWh/bimestre), la mayoría usuarios residenciales.[491]​\n\nEn 2014, se produjeron 30 880 627 m³ de petróleo y 41 483 811 millones de metros cúbicos de gas natural.[492]​ Paralelamente, durante los últimos años cobró notoriedad el hallazgo de grandes volúmenes de hidrocarburos en reservorios no convencionales (I.e: gas de lutita). Según un informe, Argentina estaría en el segundo puesto a nivel mundial en cuanto a este tipo de reservas.[493]​\n\nDe acuerdo con dos sucesivos informes de la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU), al 2015, Argentina contaba con 2 086 302 inmigrantes y, al 2017, con 2 164 524, equivalentes a un 4.6 % y 4.9 % de la población, respectivamente, asentando esta tendencia creciente.\n\nLa tasa de extranjeros en proporción a los nacidos en el país es muy pequeña en comparación con otras naciones (121.º), pero medido en términos absolutos, Argentina es el mayor receptor de inmigrantes de toda América Latina, así como el que más cantidad tiene en la región y se ubica 28.º en el ranking mundial.[552]​[553]​[554]​[555]​[556]​\n\nLas 20 mayores comunidades inmigrantes según los censos nacionales de 1991, 2001, 2010 y 2022\n\nEn 2018, el Indec llevó a cabo una encuesta nacional en localidades de más de 5000 habitantes, de la que surgió que el 10.2 % de la población total padece algún tipo de discapacidad.[q]​\n\nDe ese total, un 48.8 % tiene alguna discapacidad motora, con un 30.0 % con dificultades para caminar, un 6.1 % con dificultades en los miembros superiores, y 12.9 % con ambas. Otro 25 % del conjunto de las personas con discapacidades tiene dificultades visuales, de las cuales el 3.6 % —casi uno de cada mil habitantes— son completamente no videntes. Del total de personas con discapacidad, el 20.8 % tiene dificultades en la audición, de los cuales el 49 % no pueden oír sin audífono —un 1 % de la población total. Del total de personas con dificultades, el 7.9 % tiene dificultades en el habla y de ellos el 10.6 % —algo menos de uno de cada mil habitantes— no puede hablar en absoluto. Un 12.3 % tiene dificultades para comprender lo que oye o aprender lo que estudia o se le enseña —un 1.25 % del total de la población—, de entre los cuales uno de cada ocho afirma no poder aprender nada.[573]​\n\nEl mismo estudio detalla también que el porcentaje de personas de más de catorce años de edad con alguna discapacidad que desempeña alguna tarea remunerada es del 35.9 %, pero alcanzando al 64.3 % para el grupo de edad de entre 30 y 49 años, y disminuyendo al 13.3 % para 65 años de edad y más.[574]​\n\nMuseos, espacios de memoria y salas de espectáculos\n\nLos museos más sobresalientes son el Museo Histórico Nacional de Argentina y el MALBA, donde se hacen exposiciones de pintura y escultura. Son muy importantes también los museos paleontológicos de la Patagonia (Trelew, Plaza Huincul, etc.); las ruinas jesuíticas de San Ignacio, en Misiones o el Palacio San José en Entre Ríos.\n\nTambién son importantes los espacios de memoria creados donde funcionaron centros de detención clandestina durante la dictadura de Videla, como la ESMA en Buenos Aires y La Perla en Córdoba.\n\nPor otro lado, se destaca la actividad cultural veraniega en Mar del Plata y Villa Carlos Paz; y las fiestas y festivales populares como el Festival de Cosquín o el de Jesús María en la provincia de Córdoba. El Carnaval de Gualeguaychú es el espectáculo teatral a cielo abierto más grande de la Argentina y considerado el tercer carnaval más importante del mundo.[649]​ Cientos de fiestas nacionales se desarrollan en el país durante todo el año.\n\nEn Buenos Aires existen alrededor de cien cines y noventa teatros, con una abundante cartelera de espectáculos. La capital de Argentina también se distingue en la presentación de espectáculos o artistas de renombre internacional. Se encuentran, entre otros, los centros culturales como el Borges, el Recoleta o el San Martín.\n• None El ciclo de la ilusión y el desencanto: un siglo de políticas económicas argentinas.

Children prefer candy over broccoli, but it doesn't mean that candy is better for them. A taste preference can easily be acquired through hunger. Getting them to prefer foods that are also very good for them, is the trick. Even though it's not always needed, our way of getting them to develop a taste for a new food, works. It is described below.\n\nFish won't eat their new food? When switching to a new fish food, we highly recommend getting the fish very hungry. Often times, fish become accustomed to a particular fish food and will not eat another, no matter how good it is for them. When introducing a new food, we usually don't feed the fish for 24-48 hours, depending on the size of the fish, and then offer only one bite per fish (key to success). Remove food after 1 minute if uneaten. Do this every few hours. It may take several days, especially for larger fish that have become accustomed to other fish foods. Don't worry, fish can easily and safely go much longer than this without food. Allowing the food to sit uneaten in the tank for even a couple hours can turn them off to the food permanently. If you don't give in, this method works every time.\n\nUsing this technique, you can quickly get most fish to eat a new food like ravenous piranha without much effort. In fact, we have to be careful feeding, because they often jump out of the tank in their feeding frenzy. Watch some of our fish feeding in the below video. Keep in mind, they were first introduced to these fish foods using this technique.Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET), Chicken Polyclonal Antibody: \n• WB, ICC. A dilution of 1:5 000 to 1:10 000 is recommended for Western blot and 1:250 to 1:500 for immunocytochemistry. Biosensis recommends optimal dilutions/concentrations should be determined by the end user.\n• Recombinant His-tagged extracellular fragment of human RET protein produced using CHO cell line. The extracellular fragment of hRET was expressed and secreted to the cell culture supernatant. Protein was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography following gel-filtration from cell culture supernatant.\n• Store antibody stock solution at +4°C upon receipt. DO NOT FREEZE. This product is an (NH4)2SO4 precipitate. To use, mix well by pipetting or vortexing gently prior use, then withdraw the desired amount of antibody stock solution and dilute into your antibody dilution buffer and use normally.Alternatively, material can be centrifuged at 10K x g for 5 minutes and the liquid sulfate solution carefully removed. Then precipitated antibody can be resuspended in 0.1M P, 250mM NaCL, pH 7.4 solution. The solution should then be divided into working aliquots and stored at -80°C until used. Prevent multiple freeze thaw cycles of aliquots for best product life.\n• Store at 2-8°C upon receipt; DO NOT FREEZE. As product is (NH4)2SO4 (ammonium sulfate) precipitate, mix well by pipetting or vortexing prior to use.

Along with his Olympic silver in 1964 and his bronze medals in 1960 and 1968, Kulcsar was also Hungary’s flag bearer at the 1964, 1968 and 1972 Olympic Games.\n\nBorn in Nagyhalasz in 1934, Kulcsar was the oldest of five children. The family moved to Vac when Kulcsar was seven years old and it was there where he discovered sports, first football and then athletics.\n\nHis first major international appearance came at the 1958 European Championships in Stockholm. Although he was ranked just 22nd in the world that year, he came away from the Swedish capital with the bronze medal.\n\nHe replicated that finish two years later at the Olympic Games in Rome. In a competition where all the big throws came in the first round, Kulcsar’s opening effort of 78.57m was enough to clinch third place.\n\nKulcsar’s biggest international triumph was at the 1961 World University Games in Sofia, where he beat two-time European champion Janusz Sidlo to take the gold medal.\n\nIn 1963, Kulcsar added almost a metre to his own national record with 80.29m, the first 80-metre throw by a Hungarian man. But he was considered an outside bet for a medal at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo as Norway’s Terje Pedersen broke the world record with 91.72m just before the Games, while Sidlo and reigning European champion Janis Lusis were also in good form.\n\nPedersen, however, failed to reach the final. Sidlo and Lusis exchanged the lead in the first two rounds, but Kulcsar then took pole position with a lifetime best of 82.32m in round four. His lead was short-lived, however, as Finland’s Pauli Nevala threw 82.66m just minutes later. None of the top six improved in the last two rounds, so Kulcsar ended with the silver medal.\n\nThe 1966 European Championships were on home soil in Budapest and Kulcsar once again finished on the podium, throwing 80.54m to take the bronze medal.\n\nFor the third Games in a row, Kulcsar finished among the medals at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. As was the case in Tokyo four years prior, Kulcsar took the lead in round four with a PB, this time throwing a huge 87.06m. It remained the leading mark until the final round when Lusis (90.10m) and Finland’s Jorma Kinnunen (88.58m) surpassed it, leaving Kulcsar with the bronze medal.\n\nAlthough that was the last international medal of his career, Kulcsar went on to finish fourth at the 1969 European Championships and, at the age of 38, narrowly missed the final at the 1972 Olympics before retiring at the end of that season.\n\nHaving worked as a physical education teacher and professor earlier in his career, he became a full-time coach after retiring from competitive athletics and he guided Miklos Nemeth to Olympic gold in 1976. He was Hungary’s head throws coach until 1980 and then took on a similar role in Kuwait from 1981 to 1993.Gergely Kulcsár - Wikipedia: Gergely Kulcsár (10 March 1934 – 12 August 2020) was a Hungarian javelin thrower. He competed at the 1960, 1964, 1968 and 1972 Olympics and won two bronze medals, in 1960 and 1968, and a silver medal in 1964.[2] He was the Olympic flag bearer for Hungary in 1964, 1968, and 1972.\n\nKulcsár was the first Hungarian to throw over 80 meters and won the national title eight times.

La renta disponible final neta es la renta total percibida por el hogar durante el periodo de referencia especificado, una vez deducidos el impuesto sobre la renta, los impuestos sobre el patrimonio y las cotizaciones a la seguridad social e incluyendo las transferencias recibidas.\n\nSe recogen los ingresos netos percibidos por los miembros del hogar en el año anterior al año en que se realiza la entrevista de la Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida elaborada por el INE. La renta que se refleja en la encuesta en el año 2023 corresponde a los ingresos recibidos en el período de referencia enero-diciembre de 2022.\n\nEstos ingresos se componen de los ingresos del trabajo por cuenta ajena, beneficios/pérdidas del trabajo por cuenta propia, prestaciones sociales, rentas procedentes de esquemas privados de pensiones no relacionadas con el trabajo, rentas del capital y de la propiedad, transferencias entre hogares, ingresos percibidos por menores y el resultado de la declaración por el IRPF. No se incluyen los componentes no monetarios salvo el coche de empresa.\n\nPara una mejor comparación de los ingresos de distintos tipos de hogares (número de personas que forman parte del hogar y diferentes edades) se utiliza el concepto de renta equivalente del hogar que estandariza los hogares en función del número de unidades de consumo equivalentes que los componen.\n\nEl concepto de unidad de consumo equivalente tiene en cuenta las economías de escala que se producen al compartir los ingresos todos los miembros que componen un hogar y el número de unidades de consumo equivalente se determina utilizando la escala de la OCDE modificada. Una persona viviendo sola constituye una unidad de consumo, pues afronta por sí sola todos los gastos del hogar. Al primer adulto que forma parte del hogar se le asigna un peso de 1, a los demás adultos un peso de 0,5 y un peso de 0,3 a los menores de 14 años.\n\nLa renta equivalente de un hogar se calcula dividiendo la renta disponible total del hogar por el número de unidades de consumo equivalentes que lo componen. Esta renta equivalente se asigna por igual a todos los miembros que forman parte del hogar, obteniendo un indicador de los recursos económicos por unidad de consumo de las personas (o ingresos equivalentes de la persona) disponibles en un hogar estandarizado.\n\nSe proporciona información de los ingresos medios anuales (renta media) y de los ingresos medianos anuales (renta mediana) de los hogares estandarizados (por ingresos equivalentes de la persona o ingresos por unidad de consumo de las personas) en un año determinado.\n\nSe incluye la renta media y mediana por unidad de consumo según características individuales de los miembros que componen el hogar (sexo, edad, tipo de hogar, nivel de renta, nivel de educación, nacionalidad y grado de urbanización de la vivienda) y por ámbito geográfico (CC.AA. y UE).\n\nEn la Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida del año 2013 se adoptó una nueva metodología para el cálculo de los datos relativos a los ingresos del hogar, combinando la información proporcionada por la persona encuestada con los ficheros administrativos de la Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria, la Seguridad Social, la Hacienda Tributaria de Navarra, la Diputación Foral de Bizkaia. Se dispone de la serie con datos retrospectivos basados en la nueva metodología de cálculo adoptada en el año 2013 desde el año 2008, comparables con los nuevos datos monetarios obtenidos en el año 2023.\n\nSe proporciona información comparable de los ingresos medios y medianos de los hogares para las series: 2004-2012 (antigua metodología en el cálculo de los ingresos monetarios) y 2008-2023 (nueva metodología de cálculo de los ingresos del hogar).\n\nSegún la Encuesta de Condiciones de Vida realizada en el año 2023 analizando los datos relativos a los ingresos del hogar (corresponden a ingresos económicos del año 2022), la renta disponible final equivalente media (el concepto de equivalente permite la comparación del nivel de renta entre distintos tipos de hogar) alcanzó en la encuesta del año 2023 un valor de 20.676 euros, lo cual supone un incremento (7,9%) respecto a los obtenidos en la encuesta del año anterior.\n\nLa renta mediana equivalente de la encuesta del año 2023 alcanza una cifra para los ingresos medianos recibidos por los hogares durante el año 2022 de 18.316 euros, aumentando en un 8,9% respecto a los datos obtenidos en la encuesta del año anterior.\n\nA nivel de comunidad autónoma, los valores más altos de la renta media equivalente según la encuesta del año 2023 (ingresos del año 2022) correspondieron a País Vasco (26.298 euros), Comunidad de Madrid (24.991 euros) y Comunidad Foral de Navarra (24.495 euros).\n\nRespecto a la renta mediana equivalente de la encuesta 2023, los valores más altos correspondieron a: País Vasco (23.264 euros), Comunidad Foral de Navarra (22.471 euros) y Comunidad de Madrid (21.226 euros).\n\nEn la encuesta de condiciones de vida del año 2023, la renta media equivalente de las mujeres es de 20.410 euros y la de los hombres alcanza un valor de 20.953 euros. La renta mediana de las mujeres es de 18.063 euros y la de los hombres para el mismo periodo alcanza un valor de 18.630 euros.\n\nEn relación con la edad, los valores más altos de renta media equivalente y renta mediana equivalente según la encuesta del año 2023 correspondieron al grupo de edad de 50 a 64 años\n\nSegún el tipo de hogar, el valor más alto de la renta media equivalente y a la renta mediana equivalente según la encuesta del año 2023 correspondió al hogar formado por dos adultos ambos menores de 65 años y el valor más bajo al hogar formado por adulto solo con hijos dependientes.\n\nDistribuyendo los valores de la renta media y mediana equivalente de los hogares por deciles, según la encuesta del año 2023 el valor de la renta media equivalente en el primer decil es de 4.953 euros, en el quinto decil es de 17.090 euros y en el décimo decil es de 44.881 euros. Si se distribuye la renta mediana equivalente, el valor del primer decil es de 5.077 euros, el valor del quinto decil es de 15.758 euros y el del décimo decil de renta es de 48.401 euros según la encuesta de condiciones de vida del año 2023.\n\nEn relación con el nivel de educación, a medida que se eleva el nivel de educación se elevan los valores de la renta media y mediana equivalente de los hogares\n\nSi se considera la nacionalidad, los valores más altos de la renta media y mediana equivalente según la encuesta del año 2023 correspondieron a la nacionalidad española.\n\nEl grado de urbanización influye en los valores de la renta media y mediana equivalente. El valor más alto corresponde a las áreas densamente pobladas.OFILAC - Observatorio Fiscal del Latinoamerica y el Caribe: \n• El objetivo de la investigación fue apoyar la evaluación de la equidad horizontal y vertical del Impuesto a la Renta y del IVA en los países de Latinoamérica, para tres años no consecutivos, durante el período 2001-2011. Se evaluará la equidad horizontal y vertical de los impuestos vigentes en cada año y país, y también la que resulta de simular cambios a las estructuras de los impuestos.\n• Este manual tiene la intención de aportar a las Oficinas de Estimaciones Tributarias de América Latina, una organización conceptual acorde a la importancia de los temas que tiene a su cargo y un conjunto de técnicas y métodos de trabajo que están en consonancia con esa estructura nocional. Quiere, para ello, constituirse en un manual que pueda ser consultado por los miembros de esas oficinas cuando deseen mejorar o reformular los procedimientos de trabajo actuales, utilizar nuevos enfoques en viejas tareas o, mejor aún, modificar la organización de la oficina a partir de una visión de conjunto de las cuestiones inherentes a ella. El objetivo buscado se consigue, en primer lugar, con la presentación de la Economía de los Ingresos Tributarios, es decir, la organización conceptual imprescindible para el adecuado funcionamiento de las Oficinas de Estimaciones Tributarias. Y, luego, con el desarrollo de metodologías que les permitan obtener sus principales productos, es decir, la proyección y el análisis de los ingresos tributarios y las estimaciones de la tasa de evasión y los gastos tributarios.\n• El presente estudio tiene como objetivo analizar la implementación en los Sistemas Tributarios Latinoamericanos de impuestos y regímenes especiales heterodoxos, como los Impuestos a las Transacciones Financieras, Impuesto a los Activos Empresariales, Impuestos Presuntivos a la Renta, IETU, regímenes especiales de la renta del sector agropecuario, regímenes simplificados para pequeños contribuyentes.\n• El presente estudio consiste en un informe preliminar sobre la aplicación de impuestos al patrimonio en América Latina, donde se considera cuestiones institucionales, administrativas y de Política fiscal. Esta clase de tributos abarca un gran número de alternativas, siendo el impuesto inmobiliario la opción adoptada por la casi totalidad de los países latinoamericanos. A pesar de la diversidad de impuestos al patrimonio establecidos en la región, su desempeño como fuente de ingresos es marginal, representando en promedio 0,94% del PBI (4,94% de la carga tributaria). En comparación con los países de la OECD, se puede señalar que ellos recaudan casi el doble en términos de producto y existe una menor dispersión entre los países. El estudio trata de comprender las diferencias entre los países a través del análisis de la relación entre el desempeño del impuesto como fuente de ingresos y una serie de indicadores económicos y sociales. Se percibe que en América Latina la imposición a los patrimonios es mínima en gran parte de las naciones con mayor concentración de la renta. Además, en general, la recaudación es más baja en aquellos países con mayores niveles de pobreza e IDH y PIB per cápita bajos. Sin embargo, los resultados no soportan la hipótesis de que estos impuestos necesariamente generan ingresos significativos cuando se trata de países ricos en términos relativos.\n• El presente documento ofrece una primera caracterización del impacto sobre la equidad de los sistemas tributarios de América Latina con el objeto de servir de encuadre a futuros estudios de caso. Para ello se introducen diversas temáticas ordenadas en dos partes. La primera está dedicada a introducir consideraciones sobre el nivel de carga tributaria y estructura tributaria, poniendo el acento sobre la importancia de la denominada tributación \"directa\" y el impacto distributivo de la tributación en América Latina. La segunda, más específica, se concentra en la tributación sobre la renta, sus características, principales factores que limitan su recaudación en la región, las reformas recientes y los estudios sobre evasión. El tipo de aproximación aquí propuesto obliga a presentar un desarrollo extenso que debe recorrer una gran variedad de temas que ayudan a ordenar el análisis de los diferentes sistemas tributarios. En todo caso, la organización propuesta para este documento admite una lectura segmentada donde el lector especializado puede concentrarse en las secciones que más le interesen.\n• El ámbito de la imposición directa a la renta es posiblemente el menos analizado en América Latina, y especialmente en los países centroamericanos, posiblemente a causa de que el nivel de la recaudación así como su evolución a lo largo de esta última década no han sido significativos, a contrario de lo que ha ocurrido con el impuesto al valor agregado, cuya generalización y ritmo de crecimiento ha tenido una evolución sin precedentes. No obstante estas circunstancias se considera que conocer más profundamente los elementos que afectan su comportamiento, así como las opciones futuras de Política que se presentan para fortalecer el papel de los mismos, es de suma utilidad para los países de la región, ya que resulta evidente que un buen sistema tributario requiere de un adecuado balance de las distintas piezas que lo integran. En ese sentido, puede verse que la región está siendo sometida al choque de dos visiones opuestas sobre la orientación que debería tomar la imposición directa en los países en desarrollo con gobiernos pequeños y, por lo tanto, administraciones tributarias débiles. Por un lado, la visión clásica, o académica, que ve al sistema tributario como un todo que posee diferentes componentes y debe satisfacer a diversos objetivos. En esta visión, la función principal del impuesto a la renta no es sólo la de recaudar sino que debe hacerlo en pos del objetivo de mejorar la equidad del sistema tributario ya que es el impuesto más idóneo a esos efectos. Por otro lado, y en respuesta al fracaso en fortalecer la imposición directa a lo largo del tiempo, ha surgido otra visión que podría llamarse pragmática, la cual sostiene que la debilidad estructural de las administraciones tributarias impide implementar los controles que requiere este impuesto para su correcto funcionamiento, tanto para recaudar como para asegurar la equidad, y por ello es preferible simplificar las tareas de las mismas, sustituyéndolo alternativamente por un impuesto a los activos o a los ingresos brutos, lo que facilita el control y asegura la recaudación, aunque se sacrifique el objetivo de la equidad, entre otros.\n• In this paper, the main trends of tax burden and composition of tax revenues in Latin American countries are described, and then the short-term tax-gap, as OECD has defined it, are calculated for 18 countries. The reversal of economic cycle makes impossible to fill this gap in the short term without significant macroeconomic costs. Some room of manoeuvre, namely a cyclical safety margin, has to be considered.\n• Este documento pretende evaluar el procedimiento administrativo tributario de República Dominicana establecido en el Código Tributario y compararlo con el debido proceso determinado según la doctrina del derecho tributario y las buenas prácticas.\n• Este número de la bibliografía contiene lo siguiente: Moral Tributaria, Conciencia Tributaria, Ciudadanía Fiscal, ética y otras referencias bibliográficas.\n• A través de este trabajo, elaborado por la Secretaría Ejecutiva del CIAT, se dan a conocer los principales aspectos legislativos y administrativos suscitados en el campo de los precios de transferencia en los países de América Latina y una selección de países del Caribe. El mismo va dirigido a administraciones y especialistas tributarios interesados en analizar similitudes, diferencias y nuevos desarrollos domésticos en el ámbito de la Política tributaria; como así también buenas prácticas y aspectos organizativos y administrativos en general.\n• Este documento comprende las ponencias presentadas durante la conferencia técnica del CIAT, realizada en Lisboa, Portugal del 24 al 27 de octubre de 2011.

Se presenta una propuesta de generalización de la base tributaria compensada con una transferencia a los deciles más pobres de la población. Para poder implementar esta propuesta los autores proponen adoptar las metodologías de identificación de beneficiarios y entrega de beneficios que se emplean en los programas de transferencias condicionadas de ingreso aplicados exitosamente en la mayoría de los países de América Latina. Se examinan estimaciones para ocho países de América Latina a efectos de identificar las condiciones en las cuales la propuesta resulta viable. La última sección resume las principales conclusiones del trabajo. Este artículo forma parte de un trabajo más amplio que llevan adelante sus autores sobre Políticas fiscales y equidad.\n• El fideicomiso es un instrumento financiero utilizado en la mayoría de países de América Latina. España es el principal inversor extranjero en muchos de estos países, y cada vez es mayor su participación en proyectos relacionados con negocios fiduciarios. En este trabajo se analiza el tratamiento tributario en España de las rentas procedentes de fideicomisos latinoamericanos, cuando el beneficiario de dichas rentas sea residente en España.\n• El análisis que se realiza en este trabajo se dirige a determinar el campo de aplicación de las cláusulas de reorganización empresarial de los Convenios para evitar la doble imposición internacional (CDI) suscritos por España con México, EEUU y Francia. Dichas cláusulas pretenden, como proposición general, la eliminación de la tributación en el país de la fuente en relación con las ganancias patrimoniales derivadas de procesos de reorganización o reestructuración de sociedades, desarrollados a través de operaciones como fusiones, escisiones, canjes de valores o aportaciones no dinerarias de bienes y derechos al capital de sociedades.\n• El impuesto a la renta -en rigor, el sistema impositivo que grava la renta- ha evolucionado en su estructura como ningún otro, adaptándose a los cambios del comercio y las finanzas internacionales, los diferentes niveles de desarrollo económico e institucional, las condiciones políticoculturales y los avances tecnológicos en materia de administración, así como a los diferentes modelos de Política fiscal. Esta flexibilidad compleja le ha permitido ser el mayor recaudador de la historia durante el período de mayor crecimiento de la recaudación, el siglo XX. El impuesto sobre la renta fue fruto de la guerra y la tensión social, a diferencia del impuesto al valor agregado (IVA), instrumento de comercio eficiente y justo que fue impulsado por una comunidad europea (continental) primigenia que pensaba que la integración econímica traería la paz después de un milenio de conflictos.\n• El presente trabajo proporciona una panorámica completa y ordenada de los sistemas tributarios de once países latinoamericanos (Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, México, Perú, República Dominicana, Uruguay y Venezuela) a través del diseño en 2010 de sus impuestos más representativos:\n• - Impuesto sobre la renta de las personas físicas;\n• - Impuesto sobre la renta de las personas jurídicas;\n• - Impuesto sobre el patrimonio;\n• - Impuesto sobre el valor añadido;\n• El objetivo de este trabajo es, así, contribuir a un mejor conocimiento de los distintos modelos tributarios existentes en dicho continente y, gracias a la sistematicidad de la información presentada, a una mejor comparabilidad de dichos modelos. Con trabajos como este, el Instituto de Estudios Fiscales afianza su línea de investigación en Política tributaria comparada y la expande al continente latinoamericano, en consonancia con su vocación de constituirse en referente de los estudios sobre Hacienda Pública a nivel internacional.\n• This paper tests for horizontal tax competition in the VAT for a sample of Brazilian states in the period 1985-2001. The states have considerable autonomy to set their VAT rates and bases, often using this tax as an industrial policy tool. The empirical findings, based on the estimation of a tax reaction function in an error-correction set-up, confirm the hypothesis of horizontal tax competition: the states react strongly to changes in their neighbours? VAT code, especially those that belong to the same geo-economic region. Also, there appears to be a Stackelberg leader among the states, with the remaining jurisdictions responding strongly to its policy moves. There is no co-occupancy of tax bases between different levels of government and hence limited scope for vertical externalities in tax setting. But the fact that the federal government shares with the states part of the revenue of its more elastic taxes, such as the income tax, appears to affect the opportunity cost of horizontal tax competition.\n\nBaca-Campodónico J, L. De Mello y A. Kirilenko\n• This paper provides cross-country empirical evidence on the productivity of bank transaction taxes (BTTs). Our data set comprises six Latin American countries that have levied BTTs since the late 1980s: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. We find that, for a given tax rate, revenue declines over time. Therefore, in order to meet a fixed revenue target in real terms, the tax rate needs to be raised repeatedly. However, we also find that successive increases in the tax rate erode the tax base by more than they raise revenue yield and that the higher the increase in the tax rate, the more and faster the tax base is eroded. We conclude that BTTs do not provide a reliable source of revenue, especially over the medium term.\n\nThe tax system in Mexico - a need for strengthening the revenue-raising capacity. -- Febrero 2000\n• The Mexican tax system encompasses a number of commendable features and disincentives to work, save and invest appear less severe than in most other OECD countries. However, the system also contains major deficiencies, which hampers the efficiency and equity of the system and contribute to the fact that Mexico has by far the lowest level of tax revenues in relation to GDP among the OECD countries. The main priorities for reform should be base broadening measures such as eliminating the tax preferences for agriculture, fisheries, publishing and land transportation; substantially reducing the vast number of zero-rated and exempted goods and services in the VAT system; and broadening the income base of individuals by taxing fringe benefits and eliminate the fiscal subsidy. Furthermore, increased taxation of property, in particular real estate, would be warranted from both a revenue-raising and distributional point of view. Finally, administration could be further improved through a ...Requisitos fiscales de EE.UU. para los ingresos de YouTube - Ayuda de YouTube: Google tiene la responsabilidad de recopilar información fiscal de los creadores que participan en el Programa de socios de YouTube (YPP).

A continuación, se muestran algunas posibles situaciones de retención:\n• El creador no envía la información fiscal: La deducción fiscal final es de USD 240 porque el porcentaje de retención de impuestos es de un 24% del total de las ganancias de todo el mundo si se envía la información fiscal. Esto significa que hasta que el creador envíe la información fiscal completa, deberemos deducir como máximo un 24% de sus ganancias totales mundiales, no solo de las provenientes de EE.UU.\n• El creador envía la información fiscal y reclama un beneficio de tratado: La deducción fiscal final es de USD 15. Esto se debe a que India y EE.UU. tienen vigente un tratado tributario que reduce el porcentaje de retención de impuestos a un 15% de las ganancias provenientes de usuarios de EE.UU.\n• El creador envía la información fiscal, pero no es apto para un beneficio de tratado tributario: La deducción fiscal final será de USD 30. Esto se debe a que el porcentaje de retención de impuestos sin un tratado tributario es de un 30% de las ganancias provenientes de usuarios de EE.UU. Averigua de qué forma se pueden ver afectados tus ingresos de YouTube mediante el ejemplo de cálculo que se muestra a continuación:\n• Accede al Informe de ingresos en YouTube Analytics y fija el filtro por fecha para el período de pago relevante (por ejemplo, del 1 al 31 de oct). Puede resultar útil configurar YouTube Analytics con la moneda en la que se te paga (por ejemplo, USD).\n• Aplica un filtro geográfico para ver los ingresos estimados que provienen de Estados Unidos. Obtén más información sobre tu público en YouTube Analytics.\n• Ve a tu cuenta de AdSense para YouTube para consultar el porcentaje de retención de impuestos. El porcentaje de retención se puede ver después de enviar la información fiscal de EE.UU.\n• Multiplica los resultados de los pasos 2 y 3. Ten en cuenta que seguir los pasos anteriores solo produce una estimación de la retención de impuestos. Cuando Google comience a retener impuestos, verás el importe final de la retención en tu Informe de Transacciones de Pago normal en AdSense para YouTube (si corresponde).\n\n¿Qué ocurre si no tengo ingresos de usuarios que están en EE.UU. en mi canal?\n\nTodos los creadores del YPP deben enviar su información fiscal a Google sin importar si obtienen ingresos de usuarios que están en EE.UU. o no. En caso de que en el futuro tengas ingresos de usuarios que se encuentran en EE.UU., será útil enviar tu información fiscal de ese país para determinar tu porcentaje de retención correcto.\n\n¿Qué criterios usan para determinar si soy un creador ubicado en EE.UU. o no?\n\n¿Qué tipos de documentos relacionados con la declaración fiscal proporciona Google?\n\nVerás el importe final de retención de impuestos en el Informe de Pagos según tu ciclo de pago. Los importes retenidos suelen verse en el mes posterior al pago. Por ejemplo, los importes de retención de abril se muestran en el informe de pagos de mayo. Si hay retenciones de pagos o algún otro problema en tu cuenta, es posible que los importes finales de retención de impuestos de varios meses combinados se incluyan en el informe de pagos más adelante.\n\n \n\n Todos los creadores que envíen la información fiscal y que reciban pagos aptos recibirán un formulario fiscal (p. ej., 1042-S) el 14 de abril de cada año (o antes de esa fecha) para las retenciones de impuestos del año anterior (los formularios 1099-MISC para los creadores de EE.UU. suelen emitirse a principios de marzo). Visita nuestro Centro de ayuda para solicitar una copia, revisión o anulación de un formulario fiscal de EE.UU. de fin de año. Las opciones de entrega de documentos y los estados de documentos para los formularios fiscales de fin de año que recibes se encuentran en Configuración Administrar la información fiscal en la herramienta fiscal en tu cuenta de AdSense para YouTube. Puedes entregar los documentos fiscales de forma digital en línea, o bien, en formato físico por correo postal.\n• Si seleccionas correo postal, enviaremos los documentos físicos a la dirección de correo postal que proporcionaste en tu formulario fiscal, y tus documentos seguirán disponibles en línea. Si cambió tu dirección de correo postal, actualiza la información fiscal en tus perfiles de pagos. Google usará en tu perfil de pagos la información que enviaste en el formulario fiscal de EE.UU.\n\nGoogle puede reembolsar retenciones de impuestos de EE.UU. en algunas circunstancias si se entrega la información fiscal actualizada antes del 10 de diciembre. Por ejemplo, si se entrega oportunamente un formulario fiscal W-8 actualizado con un reclamo para un porcentaje de impuesto menor y otra documentación obligatoria, Google volverá a calcular los importes de retención y reembolsará la diferencia. Ten en cuenta que es posible que debas proporcionarnos una declaración jurada de que el estado no ha cambiado y declarar que los cambios realizados en el formulario aplican a una fecha anterior, si corresponde. Puedes hacerlo en la sección “Declaración jurada de cambio de estado” en el paso 6 de la herramienta fiscal en AdSense para YouTube. Podrás ver estos reembolsos en el ciclo de pago después de que actualices el formulario. Estas circunstancias son limitadas y la información fiscal válida se debe recibir al final del año calendario en que se retuvo el impuesto. Si no nos proporcionas la información fiscal válida en esa fecha, tendrás que presentar una solicitud para un reembolso directamente en el IRS. Recomendamos que busques asesoría fiscal con un profesional para estos fines. Todos los reembolsos aplicables aparecerán en tu Informe de Pagos al final del ciclo de pago, después de que actualices tu información fiscal en AdSense para YouTube. Ahora los canales afiliados a MCN cumplen con los requisitos para recibir reembolsos. Los afiliados deben proporcionarnos documentación válida que demuestre que un pago anterior estaba sujeto a un porcentaje más bajo. Solo los impuestos retenidos en el mismo año calendario serán aptos para recibir reembolsos. Una vez que el reembolso cumpla con los requisitos, se emitirá al propietario del contenido original al que se le retuvo el impuesto.\n\n¿Esto se aplica a mis ingresos de AdSense fuera de YouTube?Tablas del ingreso del trabajo y del crédito tributario por ingreso del trabajo (EITC) | Internal Revenue Service: Para poder reclamar el crédito tributario por ingreso del trabajo (EITC, por sus siglas en inglés), usted tiene que tener lo que califica como ingreso del trabajo y cumplir con ciertos límites de ingreso bruto ajustado (AGI, por sus siglas en inglés) además de límites en el crédito para los años tributarios actual, anteriores y futuros.\n\nUtilice las Tablas del EITC para buscar las cantidades máximas del crédito por cada año tributario.\n\nSi no está seguro si puede reclamar el EITC, utilice el Asistente Calificador del EITC.\n\nEl ingreso del trabajo incluye todos los ingresos y salarios tributables que usted recibe al trabajar para otra persona, por su propia cuenta o por un negocio o granja que usted sea el dueño.\n• Salarios, sueldos o propinas en donde se retienen impuestos federales sobre los ingresos que se informan en la casilla 1 del Formulario W-2.\n• Ingresos de un trabajo en donde su empleador no retuvo impuestos (tal como el trabajo en la economía compartida), incluyendo:\n• Manejar un automóvil para viajes o entregas reservados\n• Proporcionar otro trabajo temporal, por encargo o autónomo\n• Dinero devengado del trabajo por cuenta propia, incluyendo si usted es:\n• Ministro o miembro de una orden religiosa (en inglés)\n• Beneficios recibidos de una huelga de un sindicato\n• Ciertos beneficios por incapacidad que recibió antes de que tenía la edad mínima de jubilación\n• Paga no tributable por combate (informada en la casilla 12 con el código Q del Formulario W-2)\n• Si reclama paga no tributable por combate como ingreso del trabajo, este puede aumentarle o disminuirle la cantidad de su EITC.

Elle est drainée par l'Aisne[2],[Carte 1].\n\nL'Aisne est un cours d'eau naturel navigable de 256 km de longueur, traversant les cinq départements Meuse, Marne, Ardennes, Aisne, Oise. Elle est un affluent de rive gauche de l'Oise, ce qui fait d'elle un sous-affluent de la Seine[3]. Elle longe la commune sur son flanc sud-est sur une longueur d'environ 1,5 .\n\nUn plan d'eau complète le réseau hydrographique : la gravière 2 de Pargny (0,2 )[Carte 1],[4].\n\nEn 2010, le climat de la commune est de type climat océanique dégradé des plaines du Centre et du Nord, selon une étude du Centre national de la recherche scientifique s'appuyant sur une série de données couvrant la période 1971-2000[5]. En 2020, Météo-France publie une typologie des climats de la France métropolitaine dans laquelle la commune est exposée à un climat océanique altéré et est dans la région climatique Nord-est du bassin Parisien, caractérisée par un ensoleillement médiocre, une pluviométrie moyenne régulièrement répartie au cours de l’année et un hiver froid (3 )[6].\n\nPour la période 1971-2000, la température annuelle moyenne est de 10,2 , avec une amplitude thermique annuelle de 15,3 . Le cumul annuel moyen de précipitations est de 749 , avec 12,6 jours de précipitations en janvier et 9 jours en juillet[5]. Pour la période 1991-2020, la température moyenne annuelle observée sur la station météorologique de Météo-France la plus proche, « Banogne-Recouvrance », sur la commune de Banogne-Recouvrance à 8 à vol d'oiseau[7], est de 11,1 et le cumul annuel moyen de précipitations est de 773,4 . La température maximale relevée sur cette station est de 40,8 , atteinte le ; la température minimale est de −14 , atteinte le [Note 1],[8],[9].\n\nLes paramètres climatiques de la commune ont été estimés pour le milieu du siècle (2041-2070) selon différents scénarios d'émission de gaz à effet de serre à partir des nouvelles projections climatiques de référence DRIAS-2020[10]. Ils sont consultables sur un site dédié publié par Météo-France en novembre 2022[11].\n\nAu , Herpy-l'Arlésienne est catégorisée commune rurale à habitat dispersé, selon la nouvelle grille communale de densité à 7 niveaux définie par l'Insee en 2022[12]. Elle est située hors unité urbaine[13]. Par ailleurs la commune fait partie de l'aire d'attraction de Reims, dont elle est une commune de la couronne[Note 2],[13]. Cette aire, qui regroupe 294 communes, est catégorisée dans les aires de 200 000 à moins de 700 000 habitants[14],[15].\n\nL'occupation des sols de la commune, telle qu'elle ressort de la base de données européenne d’occupation biophysique des sols Corine Land Cover (CLC), est marquée par l'importance des territoires agricoles (90,9 % en 2018), une proportion identique à celle de 1990 (90,9 %). La répartition détaillée en 2018 est la suivante : terres arables (80,9 %), forêts (6,2 %), prairies (5,7 %), zones agricoles hétérogènes (4,3 %), zones urbanisées (2,9 %)[16]. L'évolution de l’occupation des sols de la commune et de ses infrastructures peut être observée sur les différentes représentations cartographiques du territoire : la carte de Cassini ( siècle), la carte d'état-major (1820-1866) et les cartes ou photos aériennes de l'IGN pour la période actuelle (1950 à aujourd'hui)[Carte 2].\n\nL'ajout de l'Arlésienne à la suite de Herpy, vient de la reconstruction du village, après la Première Guerre mondiale, en remerciement envers les habitants d'Arles[17],[18] qui ont subventionné en grande partie le montant des travaux.\n\nL'évolution du nombre d'habitants est connue à travers les recensements de la population effectués dans la commune depuis 1793. Pour les communes de moins de 10 000 habitants, une enquête de recensement portant sur toute la population est réalisée tous les cinq ans, les populations de référence des années intermédiaires étant quant à elles estimées par interpolation ou extrapolation[21]. Pour la commune, le premier recensement exhaustif entrant dans le cadre du nouveau dispositif a été réalisé en 2004[22].\n\nEn 2022, la commune comptait 213 habitants[Note 3], en évolution de +8,67 % par rapport à 2016 (Ardennes : −2,97 %, France hors Mayotte : +2,11 %).\n• Herpy est une étape de la Route du Porcien.\n• Herpy-l'Arlésienne sur le site de l'Institut géographique nationalHerpy-l'Arlésienne - Wikipedia: expand this article with text translated from the corresponding article in French.

The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmmaking in cooperation with the producer.[1]\n\nThe film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget.\n\nThere are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Other directors edit or appear in their films or compose music score for their films.[2]\n\nA film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a screenplay into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision.[3] To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production.[2][4] This entails organizing the film crew in such a way to achieve their vision of the film and communicating with the actors.[5][6] This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.[7] Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,[8] thus, excellent communication skills are a must.[9]\n\nBecause the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, they also need to possess conflict-resolution skills to mediate whenever necessary.[10] Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film.[5] The set of varying challenges they have to tackle has been described as \"a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\".[11] It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.[12]\n\nGenerally, the sole superiors of the director are the producers and the studio that is financing the film, although sometimes the director can also be a producer of the same film.[3][13] The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget[14] and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular age rating).[15]\n\nDirectors also play an important role in post-production. While the film is still in production, the director sends \"dailies\" to the film editor and explains their overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an editor's cut. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the director's cut. Well-established directors have the \"final cut privilege\", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.\n\nThe director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.[16] It has been said that \"20-hour days are not unusual\".[3] Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.\n\nUnder European Union law, the film director is considered the \"author\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory.[17] Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \"auteur\" (the French word for \"author\").[18] In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.[citation needed]\n\nSome film directors started as screenwriters, film editors, producers, actors, or film critics, as well as directing for similar media like television and commercials.[19][20] Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' Director of Photography; Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with Transcendence (2014). Despite the misnomer, assistant director has become a completely separate career path and is not typically a position for aspiring directors, but there are exceptions in some countries such as India where assistant directors are indeed directors-in-training.[21][22]\n\nMany film directors have attended a film school to get a bachelor's degree studying film or cinema.[23] Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film.[24] This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, communicating with professional actors, communicating with the crew, and reading scripts.[25] Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities.[26] Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production.[27] A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying.[28] Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment.[16] The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV.[29] Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works.[30] Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television.[31] The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE.[32]\n\nIn recent decades American directors have primarily been coming out of USC, UCLA, AFI, Columbia University, and NYU, each of which is known for cultivating a certain style of filmmaking.[20] Notable film schools outside of the United States include Beijing Film Academy, Centro de Capacitación Cinematográfica in Mexico City, Dongseo University in South Korea, FAMU in Prague, Film and Television Institute of India, HFF Munich, La Fémis in Paris, Tel Aviv University, and Vancouver Film School.[33]\n\nFilm directors usually are self-employed and hired per project based on recommendations and industry reputation.[34] Compensation might be arranged as a flat fee for the project, as a weekly salary, or as a daily rate.\n\nA handful of top Hollywood directors made from $133.3 million to $257.95 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg,[35] but the average United States film directors and producers made $89,840 in 2018.[36] A new Hollywood director typically gets paid around $400,000 for directing their first studio film.[37]\n\nThe average annual salary in England is £50,440, [38] in Canada is $62,408,[39] and in Western Australia it can range from $75,230 to $97,119.[40] In France, the average salary is €4000 per month, paid per project.[41] Luc Besson was the highest paid French director in 2017, making €4.44 million for Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. That same year, the top ten French directors' salaries in total represented 42% of the total directors' salaries in France.[42]\n\nFilm directors in Japan average a yearly salary from ¥4 million to ¥10 million,[43] and the Directors Guild of Japan requires a minimum payment of ¥3.5 million.[44] Korean directors make 300 million to 500 million won for a film, and beginning directors start out making around 50 million won. A Korean director who breaks into the Chinese market might make 1 billion won for a single film.[45]\n\nAccording to a 2018 report from UNESCO, the film industry throughout the world has a disproportionately higher number of male directors compared to female directors, and they provide as an example the fact that only 20% of films in Europe are directed by women.[46] 44% of graduates from a sample of European films schools are women, and yet women are only 24% of working film directors in Europe. However only a fraction of film school graduates aspire to direct with the majority entering the industry in other roles.[47] In Hollywood, women make up only 12.6 percent of film directors, as reported by a UCLA study of the 200 top theatrical films of 2017,[48] but that number is a significant increase from 6.9% in 2016.[49] As of 2014, there were only 20 women in the Directors Guild of Japan out of the 550 total members.[50] Indian film directors are also greatly underrepresented by women, even compared to other countries, but there has been a recent trend of more attention to women directors in India, brought on partly by Amazon and Netflix moving into the industry.[51] Of the movies produced in Nollywood, women direct only 2%.[52]\n\nThere are many different awards for film directing, run by various academies, critics associations, film festivals, and guilds.[53] The Academy Award for Best Director and Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director are considered among the most prestigious awards for directing,[54][55][56][57] and there is even an award for worst directing given out during the Golden Raspberry Awards.\n• The St. James Women Filmmakers Encyclopedia: Women on the Other Side of the Camera, Visible Ink Press, 1999\n• International dictionary of films and filmmakers, ed. by Tom Pendergast, 4 volumes, Detroit [etc.]: St. James Press, 4th edition 2000, vol. 2: Directors\n• Contemporary North American Film Directors: A Wallflower Critical Guide (Wallflower Critical Guides to Contemporary Directors), ed. by Yoram Allon Del Cullen and Hannah Patterson, Second Edition, Columbia Univ Press 2002\n• Alexander Jacoby, Donald Richie: A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day, Stone Bridge Press, 2008, ISBN 1-933330-53-8Director's Cut Cinema: Bright and medium bodied, with flavors of fresh red fruit and wild berries.\n\nNamed after the version of a film which most reflects the director’s vision, Director’s Cut wines represent our winemaker’s vision of varietal wines, which express true appellation character.\n\nIn the film business, the “Director’s Cut” emerged as a means for filmmakers to present their own creative vision of a story.

The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life. NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie. It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors. The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians. The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production. Ennio Morricone's music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre. Tornatore's script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.\n\n\n\nI will not spoil this story by repeating it, nor will I give away the ending, although it matters not a whit. I could disclose fully everything in this movie, and in seeing it, all my words would evaporate. There is nothing like the experience of sitting through it, becoming engulfed by it, and in the end, being changed.Contact: IU Cinema acknowledges and honors the Indigenous communities native to this region, and recognize that Indiana University Bloomington is built on Indigenous homelands and resources.

También analiza sus sueños, aspiraciones, pensamientos y sus frustraciones. El personaje, como en la realidad, acaba muriendo rodeado de pollos sin cabeza durante el saqueo de Tbilisi.\n\nDestacan los primeros planos de rostros de actores y actrices, expresiones faciales desafiantes y planos diversos mostrando la mirada de cada uno de ellos. Algo que es curioso que los personajes se mueven de forma mecánica y no natural, sus movimientos carecen de realismo.\n\nLa película tiene muy poco dialogo, pero si se centra en recalcar citas de los poemas de Sayat-Nova. Si tiene música y cantos de la época. Los ritmos medievales se mezclan con los sonidos diegéticos para componer una melodía propia.\n\nEn este trabajo destaca la belleza visual ante la palabra, lo que vemos es el elemento narrativo del que destaca el color vivo del rojo, de hay la referencia de las granadas. Otros colores relevantes son los dorados, los blancos y los cian.\n\nLa cinta tiene un total sentido reivindicativo, se pide el reconocimiento del genocidio contra el pueblo armenio entre 1915 y 1923.\n\nLa película se rodó en numerosos sitios entre Armenia, Georgia y Azerbaiyán. En Armenia como en el monasterio de Sanahin, de Haghpat y Atjala, en la iglesia de San Juan en Ardvi; en Georgia se grabó en el Monasterio de Alaverdi, el de Dzveli Shuamta cerca de Telavi y, el campo que rodea el monasterio de David Gareja; y en Azerbaiyán incluyeron la Ciudad Vieja de Bakú y la Fortaleza de Nardarán.\n\nA destacar la belleza de cada escena, la forma de contar con aquello que se ve sin lanzar palabra alguna, la gestualización de los personajes, las escenas surrealistas y la manera de rodar planos imposibles.\n\nUn film lleno de vida para disfrutarla en todos los sentidos de la palabra.Serguéi Paradzhánov - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Serguéi Paradzhánov (armenio: Սարգիս Հովսեփի Փարաջանյան, Sargís Hovsepi Paradzhanián; georgiano: სერგეი (სერგო) ფარაჯანოვი; en ucraniano: Сергій Йосипович Параджанов; en ruso: Сергей Иосифович Параджанов, Serguéi Iósifovich Paradzhánov; pronunciado Paradzhánov o Paradjánov) (Tiflis, Georgia, 9 de enero de 1924—Ereván, Armenia, 20 de julio de 1990) fue un director de cine armenio ucraniano y artista, reconocido como uno de los grandes maestros del cine del siglo XX.[1]​[2]​[3]​[4]​\n\nAunque su carrera cinematográfica empieza en 1954, Paradzhánov renegó posteriormente a todo su trabajo anterior a 1964, diciendo que era basura. Después de dirigir Teni zabýtyj prédkov (en ruso) o Tini zabútij prédkiv (en ucraniano) (Sombras de los ancestros olvidados, renombrada Caballos salvajes de fuego o Corceles de fuego, para la mayoría de las distribuidoras foráneas), Paradzhánov se convirtió en una celebridad internacional, así como en objeto de los ataques del sistema. Casi todos sus proyectos entre 1965 y 1973 fueron prohibidos, desechados o cerrados por las administraciones cinematográficas soviéticas, tanto por las locales de Kiev y Ereván, como por la federal (llamada Goskinó), hasta que fue arrestado a finales de 1973 bajo los cargos de violación, homosexualidad y cohecho. Paradzhánov estuvo en prisión hasta 1977, año en que fue liberado (a falta de 11 meses y 18 días para cumplir su condena, gracias a las peticiones de varios artistas).[5]​\n\nIncluso después de su puesta en libertad (aunque sería encarcelado otra vez en 1982) fue mal visto en el cine soviético. No sería hasta mediados de la década de 1980, cuando el clima político se hizo más suave, que Paradzhánov pudo volver a dirigir. A pesar de ello, necesitó del apoyo de su amigo y actor georgiano David Abashidze y otros amigos del mundo artístico para poder ver sus últimas películas autorizadas.\n\nSu salud había empeorado tras los cuatro años en el campo de prisioneros y 9 meses en una prisión de Tiflis. Murió en 1990 a causa de un cáncer de pulmón, justo cuando después de casi 20 años de supresión, le era permitido enseñar sus películas en festivales internacionales.\n\nParadzhánov nació de padres (Iósif Paradzhánov y Siranush Bezhánova) armenios, artistas en Tiflis, Georgia. En su infancia tuvo acceso al arte desde temprana edad. En 1945, Paradzhánov se traslada a Moscú e ingresa en el VGIK, uno de las más antiguas y más respetadas escuelas de dirección cinematográfica de Europa, estudiando bajo la tutela de los directores Ígor Sávchenko y Aleksandr Dovzhenko.\n\nEn 1948, fue acusado de haber tenido relaciones homosexuales (que eran ilegales en la URSS) con el agente del KGB Nikolái Mikava en Tiflis. Fue sentenciado a cinco años de cárcel aunque sería amnistiado tres meses después.[6]​\n\nEn 1950, Paradzhánov se casó con su primera mujer Nigyar Kerímova en Moscú. Ella provenía de una familia musulmana tártara y se convirtió a la Iglesia Ortodoxa para casarse con Paradzhánov, lo que le traería fatales consecuencias, al ser asesinada por sus parientes poco después a causa de esta conversión. A raíz de este trágico acontecimiento, Paradzhánov se trasladaría a Kiev, Ucrania. Allí produjo varios documentales (Dumka, Manos Doradas, Natalia Uzhvy) y varios filmes narrativos: Andriesh (basado en el cuento del escritor moldavo Emilián Búkov), El tipo superior (un musical sobre las granjas colectivas), Rapsodia ucraniana (un melodrama de tiempos de guerra), y Flor en la piedra (sobre un culto religioso que se infiltra en una ciudad minera del Donbás). Aprendió ucraniano y se volvió a casar en 1956 con Svitlana Ivánivna Scherbatiuk). Con Scherbatiuk tuvieron un hijo, Surén, en 1958.\n\nLa primera película de Tarkovski, La infancia de Iván tuvo un enorme impacto para el autodescubrimiento de la genialidad de Pardzhánov como cineasta (después la influencia sería mutua, incluso serían amigos íntimos). En 1964, abandonó el realismo socialista dirigiendo la poética Sombras de los ancestros olvidados (Corceles de fuego), la primera película en la que tenía todo el control creativo y que ganó varios premios internacionales.[5]​ Al contrario que su siguiente película, El color de las granadas —con su musa, Sofikó Chiaureli— fue bastante bien recibida por las autoridades soviéticas. El Consejo Editorial de Goskinó de Ucrania la alabó por \"haber sabido plasmar en el lenguaje cinematográfico la calidad poética y la profundidad filosófica del cuento de Myjailo Kotsiubynsky\", llamando a la película \"brillante éxito creativo de los Estudios cinematográficos Dovzhenko.”\n\nMoscú incluso se avino a la petición del Goskinó ucraniano de no doblar la película al ruso de cara a la proyección en toda la Unión para que no se perdiera su característico aroma ucraniano.[7]​ (El doblaje al ruso era una práctica habitual en las películas soviéticas no rusas cuando eran distribuidas fuera de su república de origen.) La película se hizo famosa en el mundo entero debido a la auténtica recreación de Paradzhánov de un mundo olvidado de los hutsules (la historia tiene lugar en los Cárpatos ucranianos, completamente ajenos a la audiencia occidental). Del mismo modo, su uso de los colores vestuario, música y trabajo de cámara era esencial tanto para contar la historia como para intimidar al espectador.\n\nPoco después, Paradzánov abandonaría Kiev para trasladarse a Armenia. En 1968, se embarcó en la filmación de Sayat Nová, para muchos su obra maestra, dedicada al poeta armenio Sayat-Nová, a pesar de haber sido realizada en difíciles condiciones y con un reducido presupuesto.[8]​ Los censores soviéticos intervinieron y la prohibieron inmediatamente por su supuestamente contenido inflamable. Paradzhánov la reeditó y la renombró como El color de las granadas. Paradzhánov produjo una extraña película representando una inmersión en la mente artística, como diría el crítico Alekséi Korotyukov: \"Paradzhánov hacía películas no sobre como son las cosas, sino como serían si él hubiese sido Dios.\"\n\nEn diciembre de 1973, las autoridades soviéticas incrementaron sus sospechas acerca de las inclinaciones subversivas de Pardzhánov (particularmente, su bisexualidad) y lo sentenciaron a cinco años en un campo de trabajo en Siberia por \"la violación de un miembro del Partido Comunista, y la propagación de pornografía\".[9]​ Tres días antes de que fuera sentenciado, Andréi Tarkovski escribió una carta al Comité central del Partido Comunista de Ucrania, afirmando: \"En los diez últimos años Serguéi Paradzhánov solo ha realizado dos películas, Sombras de los ancestros olvidados y El color de las granadas. Han influido primero en el cine de Ucrania, segundo en el del país entero, y tercero, en el del mundo. Artísticamente, hay poca gente en el mundo entero que pudiese reemplazar a Paradzhánov. Él es culpable, culpable de su singularidad. Nosotros somos culpables de no pensar en él a diario y de alcanzar a comprender el significado de un maestro.\"\n\nUn ecléctico grupo de artistas, cineastas y activistas protestó en apoyo de Paradzhánov, aunque con poco resultado (entre ellos, Yves Saint-Laurent, Françoise Sagan, Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Luis Buñuel, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, Andréi Tarkovski y Mijaíl Vartánov). Paradzhánov cumplió 4 años y 11 días de su sentencia de cinco años, agradeciendo su liberación temprana a los esfuerzos del poeta y novelista surrealista francés Louis Aragon, la escritora francesa de origen ruso Elsa Triolet (mujer de Aragon), y al escritor estadounidense John Updike.[8]​ Su liberación fue oficiada por Leonid Brézhnev, Secretario General del Partido Comunista de la Unión Soviética, presumiblemente como consecuencia del encuentro del secretario general con Aragon y Triolet en el Teatro Bolshói en Moscú. Al preguntarle el Secretario si le podía servir de alguna ayuda, Aragon, pidió la liberación de Paradzhánov, que sería efectiva en diciembre de 1977.[9]​\n\nMientras estuvo encarcelado, Paradzhánov produjo un gran número de esculturas en miniatura (algunas de las cuales se han perdido) y unos ochocientos dibujos y composiciones, muchos de los cuales se exhibieron posteriormente en Ereván, donde está permanentemente situado el museo Paradzhánov.[10]​ El museo fue abierto en 1991, un año después de la muerte de Paradzhánov, y alberga más de doscientas de sus obras, así como varios muebles de su casa de Tiflis. Sus esfuerzos en el campo fueron repetidamente impedidos por los guardias, que lo privaban de materiales y lo llamaban loco, hasta que llegó una carta de Moscú admitiendo, que \"el Director tiene mucho talento\".\"[8]​\n\nTras su vuelta a Tiflis, los censores soviéticos lo vigilaban de cerca, impidiéndole continuar con sus proyectos cinematográficos y orientándolo hacia las labores artísticas que había desarrollado durante su tiempo en el campo. Creó collages extraordinariamente intrincados y una gran colección de dibujos abstractos, además de más muñecos y extraños vestidos.\n\nEn febrero de 1982, Paradzhánov fue nuevamente encarcelado, bajo el cargo de cohecho, coincidiendo con su regreso a Moscú con ocasión del estreno de una obra conmemorando a Vladímir Vysotski en el Teatro Taganka, siendo apresado mediante engaños. Fue liberado en menos de un año con su salud severamente perjudicada.[9]​ En 1984, la suavización del régimen de la Unión Soviética permitió a Paradzhánov continuar su labor cinematográfica. Con el apoyo de varios intelectuales georgianos, filmó La leyenda de la fortaleza de Suram (ganadora de multitud de premios), basada en la novela de Daniel Chonkadze, su primera vuelta al cine desde Sayat Nová, estrenada quince años antes. En 1988, Paradzhánov realizó otra película ampliamente premiada, Ashik Kerib, basada en una historia de Mijaíl Lérmontov. Es la historia de un juglar errante que proviene de la cultura azerí. Paradzhánov dedicó la película a su íntimo amigo Andréi Tarkovski y \"a los niños de todo el mundo\".\n\nParadzhánov se dedicó entonces a un proyecto que resultó ser demasiado monumental para el estado de su salud. Murió de cáncer en Ereván, Armenia, el 20 de julio de 1990, a los 66 años, dejando su última obra La confesión, incompleta. Ha sobrevivido en su negativo original como Paradzhánov: La última primavera, editada por su amigo Mijaíl Vartánov en 1992. Dejó también un libro de memorias titulado igualmente La confesión.\n\nEntre las personalidades que lamentaron su fallecimiento cabe contar a Federico Fellini, Tonino Guerra, Francesco Rosi, Alberto Moravia, Giulietta Masina, Marcello Mastroianni y Bernardo Bertolucci.[11]​\n\nParadzhánov inventó su propio estilo cinematográfico. Su obra es extremadamente poética, artística y visionaria. Al no encuadrarse su obra en las reglas del realismo socialista (el único estilo artístico permitido por las autoridades de la URSS), y debido a sus posturas polémicas, las autoridades del cine le denegaron el permiso para rodar en diversas ocasiones.\n\nA pesar de haber estudiado cine en el prestigioso VGIK, descubrió su genio cinematográfico solo después de ver la ensoñadora obra de Tarkovski, La infancia de Iván. También admiraba a Pasolini. Paradzhánov tuvo muchos admiradores, entre ellos Orson Welles (otro artista singular aunque muy diferente en estilo), su propia visión no atrajo a muchos seguidores. \"Cualquiera que intente imitarme está perdido\", dijo una vez. A pesar de ello, existen directores como Theo Angelopoulos y Béla Tarr, que comparten la visión de Paradzhánov sobre el cine como un medio visual opuesto a las herramientas narrativas como la literatura.[12]​\n• Sombras de los ancestros olvidados (Тіні забутих предків, 1964, coescrita con Iván Chendéi, basada en la novela de Myjailo Kotsiubynsky)\n• Sayat Nová (Саят-Нова, 1968, guion de producción de El color de las granadas)\n• Estudios sobre Vrúbel (Этюды о Врубеле, 1989, retrato del Kiev del periodo de Mijaíl Vrúbel, coescrito y dirigido por Leonid Osyka)\n• El lago de los cisnes: La zona (Лебединое озеро.

Instituto de Memoria Nacional de Ucrania, 9 enero 2024«Tini zabutykh predkiv» – Serguei Paradjànov (1965): «Amor imposible: aquel que se queda en un rincón del alma, eternamente esperando» – Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer.\n\nLa Filmoteca de Catalunya, dentro del programa dedicado al director georgiano Serguei Paradjànov, nos propuso el drama autobiográfico «Tini zabutykh predkiv», aquí traducida como «La sombra de nuestro pasado o los corceles de fuego».\n\nCuenta la historia de vida de Ivan, un muchacho que vive junto a su hermano y madre, una familia humilde, en una aldea Hutsul en los Cárpatos ucranianos.\n\nEn una primera escena vemos como Iván va a buscar a su hermano en mitad del bosque nevado y justo cuando un árbol cae, su hermano lo salva y este acaba aplastado por el madero del mismo y muere. A destacar de esta escena la forma en que se sigue con la cámara la caída del tronco y posterior corte para ver como yace el hermano.\n\nPor otro lado tenemos a Marichka, de padres con posibles y de la que esta enamorado Iván.\n\nSus familias, como «I Capuleti e i Montecchi», son enemigas y todo se complica cuando el padre de Marichka mata al de Iván al salir de misa.\n\nPese a todo lo sucedido, los pequeños no quieren desprenderse el uno del otro, y hasta planean casarse en un futuro lejano.\n\nBajo esas circunstancias, por parte de los mayores se ven obligados a separarse, pero si no antes hacer un pacto de conexión, un elemento astro; una estrella permite que al mirarla de noche se acuerden el uno del otro.\n\nPara labrar el futuro deseado, Iván se marcha a buscarse la vida trabajando de diversas cosas y así ahorrar para el matrimonio. En su ausencia, Marichka sufre un accidente; se resbala tratando de rescatar un cordero atrapado en lo alto de un monte escarpado, cae al río y se ahoga.\n\nIván, de vuelta, encuentra el cuerpo yacente a los márgenes del rio. En este punto, hablando de la técnica fílmica, se realiza en un plano único, muy acertado y desgarrador.\n\nEn la siguiente escena vemos a Iván, destrozado, dando sepultura a Marichka en el monte.\n\nSe inicia un duelo personal que le lleva a refugiarse en el trabajo hasta que aparece Palagna, una joven que trata de seducirlo mientras este le coloca unas herraduras a su caballo.\n\nPasado un tiempo, se casan de acuerdo con la tradición hutsul y se ocupan en las labores del campo pero su relación estropeará a causa de los pensamientos que Iván sigue teniendo de su amada Marichka.\n\nAl ver que Iván no está muy por la labor de Palagna, esta busca auxilio a un hechizo para quedarse embarazada.\n\nA la par, Palagna inicia una relación sentimental con Yura, cosa que descubre Iván al verlos escondido tras unos tablones, un brujo temido por los aldeanos que invoca y ahuyenta la tormenta.\n\nDías mas tarde, Yura bebe solo en la taberna del lugar. En estas llega Iván y Palagna, que esta se arrima al brujo cuando Iván se une a los aldeanos que andan cantando.\n\nUn amigo de Iván trata de separar a Palagna de Yura y, este es golpeado por el mismo Yura. Iván ve a su mujer abrazada a Yura y toma un hacha que hay en la taberna. A su vez, Yura empuña otra y le da un golpe en la cabeza.\n\nIván sale maltrecho hacia al monte dejando a su mujer en la taberna con el brujo y encuentra a Marichka reflejada en el agua del río.\n\nEn una escena final, Marichka extiende la mano hacia Iván y se funden en un abrazo, por ende entendemos que muere unido a su verdadero amor.\n\nLos aldeanos acaban dando sepultura a Iván, recordando uno de ellos que el mismo Iván quería que lo enterrasen con la ropa blanca que usaba de pequeño.\n\nAl final vemos a Ocho niños a través de ocho cristales de una ventana en una cabaña a modo de unir el inicio de la infancia de Iván con el fin del mismo.\n\nA destacar la calidad argumental, la forma de rodar y de contar me recuerda a la «Ivànovo detstvo» (1962) de Andrei Tarkovski, la elección del elenco muy acertada y lo mas curioso de todo es el juego de colores por escenas, donde predominan los rojos y fundidos a cambio de espacio a la vez que muchos planos, que pudieran ser rodados de manera sencilla, Paradjànov los complica para hacerlos excepcionales.\n\nUn imprescindible de ser visionado al menos una vez en la vida.INEbase / Sociedad /Salud /Estadística de defunciones según la causa de muerte / Últimos datos: La Estadística de defunciones según la causa de muerte constituye una de las fuentes de información más importantes en el campo de la Sanidad.

Esta investigación puede incluir una autopsia, una revisión del la escena de la muerte y analizar la historia clínica completa del niño y la familia.1\n\nLos datos de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC en sus siglas inglés) muestran que en 2009 (el año más reciente sobre el cual hay datos disponibles) murieron 2.226 niños debido al SIDS. 2\n\nEl SIDS es la principal causa de muerte en niños de entre 1 mes y 1 año3 La mayoría (90%) de las muertes por SIDS se produce antes de que el niño tenga 6 meses y es más frecuente entre el primero y el cuarto mes de vida.4\n\n¿Cómo pueden los padres y los cuidadores reducir el riesgo de SIDS?\n\nEn la actualidad, no se sabe cómo prevenir completamente el SIDS, pero se puede reducir el riesgo.\n\nLo más efectivo que padres y cuidadores pueden hacer es siempre colocar al bebé boca arriba a la hora de dormir. Las investigaciones muestran que5:\n• Dormir boca abajo conlleva el riesgo más alto de SIDS (entre 1,7 y 12,9 veces el riesgo de dormir boca arriba).\n• Dormir de costado también aumenta el riesgo de tener SIDS, ya que se trata de una posición inestable y los bebés pueden darse vuelta con facilidad y quedar boca abajo.\n• Dormir boca arriba conlleva el riesgo más bajo de SIDS y, por lo tanto, es lo más seguro.\n\nPara más información sobre el SIDS y cómo reducir el riesgo, visite el tema de salud SIDS.\n\n« ¿Cuáles son las mejores \n\n estrategias de alimentación?¿Cómo se puede promover la \n\n seguridad de los niños en un coche? »"}

He was known in the music and film fields as José Mojica.[1]\n\nMojica joined the world of the American film industry before entering religious life. Together with Dolores del Río, Tito Guízar, Ramón Novarro and Lupe Vélez, he was among the few Mexican people who made history in the early years of Hollywood. Regarding his activity as a friar, singer and actor, he felt that religion and art have never been at conflict. If God gave me the grace of voice and singing skills, I use them for His glory, he explained.[1]\n\nBorn in San Gabriel, Jalisco, Mojica was raised in a coffee and sugar plantation community until the age of six, after his step-father Francisco died. He never knew his real father. When his mother's extended family suffered financial challenges, they moved with limited means to Mexico City where he studied at the Academy of San Carlos and later attended the National School of Agriculture.[1]\n\nMojica wrote about the Revolution and Counter Revolution, the closing of the military academy due to the Mexican Revolution armed conflict, and his personal struggle from these events, in his book \"I, a Sinner\".[2] This experience led him to find his true calling. He began taking private voice lessons while studying at the National Conservatory of Music of Mexico.[2]\n\nWhile at the Conservatory, Mojica also developed skills in drama and displayed a particular gift for languages, there mastering English, Italian and French. He learned to play the guitar and Mexican songs and practiced dance, athletics and horse riding.[2] He would eventually begin working as an operatic tenor at the Teatro Ideal. On 5 October 1916 he debuted at the Teatro Arbeu, playing the Count Almaviva role in Rossini's opera The Barber of Seville.[1] The following year, he performed the role of Rodrigo in Verdi's Otello.[1]\n\nShortly after the United States entered World War I, funded with $500, Mojica moved to New York City and worked petty jobs before joining an opera company. In his spare time, he attended performances of Enrico Caruso at the Metropolitan Opera.[1] The famed Caruso, having met Mojica in 1919, was impressed with Mojica's vocal skills and helped him obtain a contract with the Chicago Civic Opera company.[3] He debuted on 22 November and performed the minor role of Lord Arthur Bucklaw in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor that same year,[1] an opera loosely based upon Sir Walter Scott's historical novel The Bride of Lammermoor.[4]\n\nWhile in Chicago he landed secondary roles, with his career slowly gaining momentum in 1921 when playing leading parts in Debussy´s Pelléas et Mélisande and Prokofiev's The Love for Three Oranges, the former alongside renowned soprano Mary Garden.[5] Prokofiev attended Mojica's rehearsals where Mojica performed his first performance on 30 December, singing in French.[5] Mojica also befriended Feodor Chaliapin during the singer's visit to Chicago. Under Chaliapin's guidance, he played the role of Shúyskiy in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov.[5]\n\nIn 1924 Mojica sang three roles at the San Francisco Opera. He appeared as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly, Rinuccio in Gianni Schicchi and Rodolfo in La Boheme. These were his only appearances in San Francisco.\n\nCaruso made two additional introductions that impacted his career. In the first. Caruso recommended Mojica to Edison to become one of Edison's Three Tenors. The second Caruso sending letters of introduction along with Mojica to Hollywood where young voices were needed to sing in 'talkies'. Going to California, and except for individual trips back to Chicago and New York for singing engagements, his career continued in films in Hollywood and throughout Latin America.\n\nIn 1933, after leaving Chicago, Mojica made a trip across the Atlantic, singing at the Mexican Embassy in Berlin and performing in Italy and Egypt.[5] He also performed at the Chicago Opera as Fenton in Verdi's Falstaff during the 1940 season.[5]\n\nThe versatility of Mojica is reflected in his extensive discography, which he recorded for Edison[6] and the Victor Talking Machine Company.[7]\n\nBy the time Mojica recorded for Edison in 1925, he had become an important figure at the Chicago Opera, moving into principal roles. He left Edison and joined the Victor roster in 1927 and made several successful early sound films. He moved comfortably during the 1930s through the worlds of opera, film, and concerts, but left this milieu in 1943 to become a priest. Like Edison, Mojica would eventually become completely deaf.\n\nHis popular musical recordings show an attractive lyrical voice being used with skill and imagination in songs such as Júrame, composed for Mojica by María Grever, released by Victor in 1927.[8] The song became an instant success and has been recorded by countless singers over the years.\n\nOpera work aside, Mojica found time to pursue an acting career in Hollywood. To this end, he began to court film Directors, one of whom was King Vidor. When Vidor learned that Mojica wanted to build a hacienda with a music salon in which to 'showcase his talent', he introduced Mojica to the architect John Byers who had recently finished designing Vidor's home. Mojica told everyone he was building his mother a \"replica of the hacienda her family had lost during secularization.\" That so irritated Byers that he removed the hacienda from the list of homes he'd designed.\n\nThe Hacienda Mojica in Santa Monica Canyon where he later lived with his mother, Dona Virginia, was in an idyllic setting on Santa Monica Creek with neighbors Leo Carrillo and Dolores del Río as well as the remnants of the original Mexican Land Grant family. This home not only served as Mojica's \"showcase\" but through his constant entertaining it quickly became the center of Hollywood's Latino actors community. \"Mojica's Rancho on Santa Monica Creek was a place where we could relax and be ourselves, away from Hollywood's expectations of players under contracts.\"[citation needed]\n\nThis home provided him with 'a stage' in which to perform and garner attention from the nearby Studios. Mojica signed a contract with Fox Film Corporation in 1930, making his debut the same year as a Spanish outlaw in the romantic musical One Mad Kiss (1930), co-starring Argentine actress Mona Maris.[3] He co-starred with her in other films, and often alongside Spanish actresses Conchita Montenegro and Rosita Moreno.[3] By finding himself in leading roles through his acting career, he was able to adapt to varied roles which included Latin lovers, a Russian cossack, Sultan of a harem, and a curious impersonation of the legendary Dick Turpin.[3] For the rest of the decade, he also filmed in Argentine, Mexico, Peru and Spain.\n\nA short time before his retirement, Mojica originally performed the song Solamente una vez,[9] written by Agustín Lara, in the 1941 film Melodías de América.[10] This song was known later as You Belong to My Heart, with English lyrics written by Ray Gilbert, and has been recorded by many other artists, including Andrea Bocelli, Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby, Charlie Haden and Elvis Presley.[11]\n\nAntigua Villa Santa Monica is located at San Miguel de Allende, a city and municipality in the state of Guanajuato in North-Central Mexico.[12] This estate was built in the 17th century with Spanish mining wealth when the nearby mountains were rich with silver. Abandoned at the time of the Mexican Revolution, the villa sat in ruins for years; Mojica acquired it in 1933 and rebuilt it for his mother, whose health was declining. Intrigued by the beauty of this community, Mojica entertained lavishly at Villa Santa Monica (named after his hacienda in California.) It was his joy to introduce his professional friends to the beauty of Colonial City and his guests included composers, writers, opera stars, actors and painters. Mojica envisioned an artistic enclave for San Miguel. Guests from the artistic community included María Félix, Dolores del Río, Pedro Armendáriz, Gary Cooper, John Ford, John Huston, Pedro Infante, Agustín Lara, Jorge Negrete, Pedro Vargas and John Wayne to this villa. Today, some trees on the property retain the nameplates of the celebrities who planted them.[13] Fate stepped into the picture when Mojica met two young Americans travelling across Mexico on a train and invited them to visit him in San Miguel. They did, and they returned to found Belles Artes and the Instituto Allende. Today, Mojica's cultural mecca vision for the city is rewarded by San Miguel de Allende recognizing him a Distinguished Citizen and his former home on Parque Juarez being operated as Hotel Villa Santa Monica, (www.santamonica.mx)[14] a luxurious B&B on a street named Padre Mojica.[13] The Antigua Villa Santa Monica became a prestigious hotel in the mid 1940s after the death of his mother.\n\nThe death of his mother in 1942 led him to reconsider his life. Two years later, he gave up his professional career and joined the Franciscan Order in Peru, distributing his estate mainly to the religious order. But first he endowed an orphanage in San Miguel.\n\nEven after retiring from acting, Mojica periodically performed to support laudable charitable causes.[5] Following his career he left for Cuzco, Perú, entering the Monastery of San Francisco, Lima and adopted the name of Fray Francisco José de Guadalupe Mojica. He was ordained a priest on 13 July 1947 by Peruvian Cardinal Juan Gualberto Guevara.[15]\n\nIn Lima, Fray Mojica founded a school to train priests. Nevertheless, the lure of the stage could not be long absent from his life, for Mojica began directing amateur plays and later became a painter to continue his artistic legacy.[5] Then, spanning the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, he appeared in a few films in order to collect money for his order, which included the inauguration of the first television station in Brazil and South America, Rede Tupi, in 1950, and a concert tour of Central America to raise funds in 1954.\n\nWhen Mojica became afflicted with temporary deafness, he was prompted by his superiors to write his autobiography, putting a halt to his singing. He finished his memoir, Yo pecador... (I, a Sinner) in 1956. The book sold more than three million copies in Spanish before its translation into English in 1963.[5] A film adaptation of the book with the same title was released in 1959.[16]\n\nMojica eventually lost his hearing entirely and became deaf. After suffering for years from acute hepatitis, he died in 1974 of heart failure at the Monastery of San Francisco in Lima, just six days after his 79th birthday.[5]\n• Berger, Dina; Wood, Andrew Grant (2010).

Poco tiempo después, a la muerte de su padre, emigró su madre con él a la Ciudad de México, donde ingresó en el colegio Saint Marie, y continuó luego sus estudios en la Escuela Elemental No 3 y en el Colegio de San Ildefonso, ubicado en el centro de la ciudad. Sus anhelos de estudiar en el ITI se vieron recompensados, pero al poco tiempo abandonó los estudios de agronomía. Durante este lapso, estudió canto en el Conservatorio Nacional de Música, bajo la batuta del maestro José Pierson –máxima autoridad del bel canto de aquellos años, descubridor de Pedro Vargas, Juan Arvizu, Hugo Avendaño, Jorge Negrete– y del doctor Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, quien le aconsejó abrazar esa nueva vocación.\n\nDebutó como tenor en el Teatro Ideal. Después, participó en la puesta en escena de la obra El barbero de Sevilla, el 5 de octubre de 1916, en el Teatro Arbeu (hoy Biblioteca Miguel Lerdo de Tejada), donde alcanzó su consagración.\n\nLa incipiente ambición le llevó a emigrar a Nueva York durante la Primera Guerra Mundial. Allí, comenzó a buscar audiciones al tiempo que para su subsistencia trabajaba como lavaplatos[1]​ en un restaurante de lujo. La oportunidad le llegó al integrarse a una compañía de teatro llevando la interpretación de papeles secundarios. Allí conoció al compositor cubano Ernesto Lecuona, quien al descubrir su talento lo llevó a Hollywood para cantar en la película La cruz y la espada, en 1934.\n\nSeguidamente, lo presentó en La Habana (Cuba), donde interpretó obras como \"Canto Siboney\", \"Siempre en mi corazón\" y la romanza \"María La O\", páginas que dejó grabadas para la RCA Victor.\n\nOtra gran oportunidad surgió al ser reconocido por Enrico Caruso,[1]​ quien al escucharle le encauzó hacia la Compañía de Ópera de Chicago. Siguiendo la recomendación de Caruso, complementó su preparación estudiando inglés, francés e italiano, además de equitación, danza y atletismo. La prueba de fuego para José se presentó al debutar al lado de la diva escocesa Mary Garden, quien era directora de la Compañía de Ópera de Chicago, durante la puesta en escena de la obra Pelléas et Mélisande, de Claude Debussy, en el Metropolitan Opera House, donde alcanzó un éxito enorme en el papel de Pelléas.\n\nYa consagrado en el ambiente operístico, alternó con grandes figuras como Lily Pons y Amelita Galli-Curci, y fue invitado por el sello Edison para grabar discos de canto operístico y canciones tradicionales de México.\n\nA raíz de la creciente fama, fue invitado a incursionar en el cine de Hollywood, donde debutó en el filme de James Tinling, One Mad Kiss, alternando con Antonio Moreno. Su estadía en los sets fílmicos norteamericanos se prolongó hasta 1938 cuando, ya convertido en gran figura del cine, a la altura de Nelson Eddy o Howard Keel, decidió continuar su actividad artística en México.\n\nContinuó filmando en México, donde El capitán aventurero (1938) elevó su notoriedad en el medio artístico de ese país. La gran fama desarrollada le permitió adquirir la Antigua Villa Santa Mónica, en San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, México, para regalársela a su madre, quien la habitó desde 1930 hasta su muerte en 1940.\n\nFue precisamente la muerte de su madre lo que le llevó a una depresión, que le hizo considerar la idea de ser religioso. El acercamiento de toda su vida, por medio de su madre, a la religión católica, y su participación en la película La cruz y la espada, donde tuvo contacto con la vida monástica, se presenta oportuna para decidir cambiar drásticamente el rumbo de su vida, y consagrar su vida a Dios por medio de la Orden Franciscana. Él mismo en alguna ocasión declaró que la decisión también fue influida por una aparición de Teresita de Jesús, quien le encomendó seguir los pasos de la religión. En fin, indudablemente la muerte de su madre operó en él un cambio. Y esto propició un alejamiento relativo de los escenarios, inclusive del cine, y que el afamado cantante y actor se deshiciera de todas su propiedades y pertenencias. Es significativa su participación en el filme argentino Melodías de América, donde su interpretación de la canción \"Solamente una vez\" mostraba indicios de su inminente decisión.[1]​ Al respecto, él narra en su película biográfica (Yo, pecador, 1959, dirigida por Alfonso Corona Blake), que fue Agustín Lara quien le compuso esta canción al enterarse de que ya no se dedicaría al medio artístico, por su consagración. En 1942, ingresó al seminario Franciscano de Cuzco, en Perú, en el que adoptó el nombre de Fray José de Guadalupe Mojica. Después, se trasladó al monasterio de San Antonio de la Recoleta, y culminó con su ordenación como sacerdote a cargo del arzobispo de Lima, cardenal Juan Gualberto Guevara, el 13 de julio de 1947,[2]​ en el templo Máximo de San Francisco de Jesús, en la misma ciudad de Lima, Perú. No obstante, dicho acontecimiento no significó el fin de su trayectoria, ya que la fama le ayudó a reunir fondos para la instauración de un seminario en Arequipa, recorriendo Argentina y otros países más.\n\nHacia 1942, decidió escribir el libro Yo, pecador, Editado por Editorial Jus México en 1952, donde narra la historia de su vida y habla de su conversión a la vida religiosa. El libro sirvió de argumento para una película en la cual participó también, y cuyo principal protagonista fue el actor Pedro Geraldo.[1]​\n\nSu popularidad en la década de los cincuenta fue enorme. Actuó ante Pio XII, y ante los presidentes de numerosos países. En 1953 escribió el guion de la película El pórtico de la gloria, una película que rodó durante la gira del orfeón por España y en la que aparecía con el hábito franciscano. Aprovechó una pausa del rodaje para trasladarse a Bilbao, donde convivió durante unos días con la comunidad de franciscanos de Irala. Desde allí se acercó a la basílica de Nuestra Señora de Begoña, donde celebró una misa.[1]​\n\nHacia 1969, fue objeto de un sentido homenaje organizado por el Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, en la Ciudad de México. Regresó posteriormente a su vida religiosa en el convento de San Francisco en Lima, Perú.\n\nMurió en 1974 después de una grave hepatitis, y fue atendido por su comunidad. Anteriormente, a causa de unas graves deficiencias en la circulación arterial, le habían amputado una pierna en el hospital de Lima.[1]​ Su cuerpo fue enterrado en las catacumbas del convento.\n• Hay que casar al príncipe (1931)\n• El caballero de la noche (1932)\n• El precio de un beso (1933)\n• The King of Gypsies (El rey de los gitanos) (1933)\n• La cruz y la espada (1934)\n• El Capitán aventurero -basado en la pieza de Manuel Penella, \"Don Gil de Alcalá\" (1938)\n• El Pórtico de la Gloria (1953; como Fray José de Guadalupe Mojica)\n• Yo pecador (1959) con Sara García, Pedro Armendáriz y Libertad Lamarque.\n• Seguiré tus pasos (1966), con Julián Bravo y Manuel López Ochoa.\n• El pecado de una madre (1960), on Libertad Lamarque y Dolores del Río.\n• En 1926 conoció en la ciudad de Nueva York a María Joaquina de la Portilla Torres, conocida como María Grever, y accedió a grabarle una canción que la lanzaría a la fama como compositora, ésta fue Júrame, y se convirtió así en su primer intérprete.[cita requerida]\n• En 1937, durante una gira por Sudamérica, específicamente por Argentina, a sugerencia del compositor José Sabre Marroquín (quien se encontraba agobiado por el inclemente invierno argentino), compuso la letra de la canción Nocturnal.

Jose Mojica-Mercado: U.S. Marine Corps Cpl. Jose Mojica-Mercado, a 20-year-old from Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, currently serves as a legal clerk at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, North Carolina. Joining the Marine Corps Dec. 5, 2018, Mojica-Mercado saw enlistment as an opportunity to serve his country and wanted to be part of the illustrious history of the Marine Corps.\n\n\n\n “Learning the history of Iwo Jima and the Frozen Chosin from my recruiter really encouraged me to join the Marine Corps,” said Mojica-Mercado. “Hearing about the hardships they went through fighting for the country filled my body with motivation to do more as a person and join something bigger than myself.”\n\n\n\n Mojica-Mercado went to recruit training filled with purpose and enthusiasm to be a Marine, but going through boot camp was no easy process. The trials of boot camp wore on Mojica-Mercado’s physical and mental state. Whenever he was having a hard time he would think about the struggles that the Marines before him went through and he would keep pushing himself forward. Mojica-Mercado also found a lot of motivation from the people at home who believed in him.\n\n\n\n “The letters I received in boot camp from my friends and family really helped and encouraged me,” said Mojica-Mercado. “Their letters said things like ‘you’re the best, you’re a beast, I’m so proud of you’ and reading that was something I leaned on from time to time.”\n\n\n\n The letters from his mother especially motivated him to push through those tough times and keep going until the end of recruit training. After that, Mojica-Mercado went to Marine Combat Training at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and then went to his school house to learn how to be an administrative specialist in Camp Johnson, North Carolina.\n\n\n\n Nearly two years since he stepped on the legendary yellow footprints, Mojica-Mercado is now stationed at MCAS Cherry Point, serving as a legal clerk and says he is enjoying his time in the Marine Corps. He still thinks about the support he got from his friends and family in boot camp and tries to apply it to his work as a legal clerk helping Marines.\n\n\n\n “Receiving those letters in boot camp resonated with me going forward in my military career,” said Mojica-Mercado. “I try to motivate and support the Marines I work with and help the different Marines whose paperwork I deal with on a daily basis.”\n\n\n\n Mojica-Mercado plans to keep enjoying serving as a Marine and hopes to re-enlist to continue studying law with the hope that once he leaves the Marine Corps he can continue to serve and aid his community by becoming a sheriff.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy."}

A symbol of the city, it is known for its density within the capital's territorial limits, uniform architecture and historical entrances influenced by Art Nouveau. The system is 245.6 kilometres (152.6 mi) long, mostly underground.[3] It has 321 stations of which 61 have transfers between lines.[1][4] Operated by the Régie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP), it has sixteen lines (with an additional four under construction), numbered 1 to 14, with two lines, Line 3bis and Line 7bis, named because they used to be part of Line 3 and Line 7, respectively. Three lines (1, 4 and 14) are automated.[5] Lines are identified on maps by number and colour, with the direction of travel indicated by the terminus.\n\nIt is the second-busiest metro system in Europe, after the Moscow Metro, as well as the tenth-busiest in the world.[6] It carried 1.498 billion passengers in 2019, roughly 4.1 million passengers a day, which makes it the most used public transport system in Paris.[7] It is one of the densest metro systems in the world, with 244 stations within the 105.4 km2 (41 sq mi) of the City of Paris. Châtelet–Les Halles, with five Métro and three RER commuter rail lines, is one of the world's largest metro stations.[8] The system generally has poor accessibility since most stations were built underground well before ease of access started being taken into consideration.\n\nThe first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle).[3] The system expanded quickly until World War I and the core was complete by the 1920s; extensions into suburbs were built in the 1930s. The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and, in particular, the short distances between stations. In 1998, Line 14 was put into service to relieve RER A. Line 11 reaching Rosny–Bois-Perrier in 2024 is the network's most recent extension. A large expansion programme known as the Grand Paris Express (GPE) is currently under construction with four new orbital Métro lines (15, 16, 17 and 18) around the Île-de-France region, outside the Paris city limits. Further plans exist for Line 1, Line 7, Line 10, a merger of Line 3bis and Line 7bis, Line 12, as well as a new proposed Line 19 in the city's outer suburbs.\n\nBesides the Métro, central Paris and its urban area are served by five RER lines (602 km or 374 mi with 257 stations), fourteen tramway lines (186.6 km or 115.9 mi with 278 stations),[9] nine Transilien suburban trains (1,299 km or 807 mi with 392 stations),[10] in addition to three VAL lines at Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport,[11] making Paris one of the cities in the world best served by public transportation. Despite the network's uniform architecture, several of its stations stand out at the hand of their unique design.[12] The Métro itself has become an icon in popular culture, being frequently featured in cinema and mentioned in music.[13][14] In 2021, the RATP started offering an umbrella lending service at several Métro and RER stations, highlighting the Métro's own rabbit mascot, which advises children on staying away from the closing doors.[15]\n\nMétro is the abbreviated name of the company that originally operated most of the network: the Empain group subsidiary Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris S.A. (\"Paris Metropolitan Railway Company Ltd.\"), shortened to \"Le Métropolitain\". It was quickly abbreviated to Métro, which became a common designation and brand name for rapid transit systems in France and in many cities elsewhere.\n\nThe Métro is operated by the Régie autonome des transports parisiens (RATP), a public transport authority that also operates part of the RER network, light rail lines and many bus routes. The name Métro was adopted in many languages, making it the most used word for a (generally underground) urban transit system. \"Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain\" may have been adapted from the name of London's pioneering underground railway company,[16] the Metropolitan Railway, which had been in business for almost 40 years prior to the inauguration of Paris's first line.[17]\n\nBy 1845, Paris and the railway companies were already thinking about an urban railway system to link inner districts of the city. The railway companies and the French government wanted to extend mainline railways into a new underground network, whereas the Parisians favoured a new and independent network and feared national takeover of any system it built. The disagreement lasted from 1856 to 1890. Meanwhile, the population became denser and traffic congestion grew massively. The deadlock put pressure on the authorities and gave the city the green light.\n\nPrior to 1845, the urban transport network consisted primarily of a large number of omnibus lines, consolidated by the French government into a regulated system with fixed and unconflicting routes and schedules. The first concrete proposal for an urban rail system in Paris was put forward by civil engineer Florence de Kérizouet. This plan called for a surface cable car system. In 1855, civil engineers Edouard Brame and Eugène Flachat proposed an underground freight urban railway, due to the high rate of accidents on surface rail lines. On 19 November 1871 the General Council of the Seine commissioned a team of 40 engineers to plan an urban rail network. This team proposed a network with a pattern of routes \"resembling a cross enclosed in a circle\" with axial routes following large boulevards. On 11 May 1872 the Council endorsed the plan, but the French government turned down the plan. After this point, a serious debate occurred over whether the new system should consist of elevated lines or of mostly underground lines; this debate involved numerous parties in France, including Victor Hugo, Guy de Maupassant, and the Eiffel Society of Gustave Eiffel, and continued until 1892. Eventually the underground option emerged as the preferred solution because of the high cost of buying land for rights-of-way in central Paris required for elevated lines, estimated at 70,000 francs per metre of line for a 20 meters (65 ft 7 in)-wide railway.\n\nThe last remaining hurdle was the city's concern about national interference in its urban rail system. The city commissioned renowned engineer Jean-Baptiste Berlier, who designed Paris' postal network of pneumatic tubes, to design and plan its rail system in the early 1890s. Berlier recommended a special track gauge of 1,300 mm ( 4 ft 3+3⁄16 in) (versus the standard gauge of 1,435 mm or 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) to protect the system from national takeover, which inflamed the issue substantially. The issue was finally settled when the Minister of Public Works begrudgingly recognised the city's right to build a local system on 22 November 1895, and by the city's secret designing of the trains and tunnels to be too narrow for mainline trains, while adopting standard gauge as a compromise with the state.\n\nOn 20 April 1896, Paris adopted the Fulgence Bienvenüe project, which was to serve only the city proper of Paris. Many Parisians worried that extending lines to industrial suburbs would reduce the safety of the city. [citation needed] Paris forbade lines to the inner suburbs and, as a guarantee, Métro trains were to run on the right, as opposed to existing suburban lines, which ran on the left.\n\nUnlike many other subway systems (such as that of London), this system was designed from the outset as a system of (initially) nine lines. Such a large project required a private-public arrangement right from the outset – the city would build most of the permanent way, while a private concessionaire company would supply the trains and power stations, and lease the system (each line separately, for initially 39-year leases).[further explanation needed] In July 1897, six bidders competed, and The Compagnie Generale de Traction, owned by the Belgian Baron Édouard Empain, won the contract; this company was then immediately reorganised as the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain.\n\nConstruction began in November 1898. The first line, Porte Maillot–Porte de Vincennes, was inaugurated on 19 July 1900 during the Paris World's Fair. Entrances to stations were designed in Art Nouveau style by Hector Guimard. Eighty-six of his entrances are still in existence.\n\nBienvenüe's project consisted of 10 lines, which correspond to current Lines 1 to 9. Construction was so intense that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected in favor of the cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work. Bienvenüe, a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift repaving of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.\n\nLine 1 and Line 4 were conceived as central east–west and north–south lines. Two lines, ligne 2 Nord (Line 2 North) and ligne 2 Sud (Line 2 South), were also planned but Line 2 South was merged with Line 5 in 1906. Line 3 was an additional east–west line to the north of line 1 and line 5 an additional north to south line to the east of Line 4. Line 6 would run from Nation to Place d'Italie. Lines 7, 8 and 9 would connect commercial and office districts around the Opéra to residential areas in the north-east and the south-west. Bienvenüe also planned a circular line, the ligne circulaire intérieure, to connect the six mainline stations. A section opened in 1923 between Invalides and the Boulevard Saint-Germain before the plan was abandoned.\n\nOn 31 January 1904, a second concession was granted to the Société du chemin de fer électrique souterrain Nord-Sud de Paris (Paris North-South underground electrical railway company), abbreviated to the Nord-Sud (North-South) company. It was responsible for building three proposed lines:\n• Line A would join Montmartre to Montparnasse as an additional north–south line to the west of Line 4.\n• Line B would serve the north-west of Paris by connecting Saint-Lazare station to Porte de Clichy and Porte de Saint-Ouen.\n• Line C would serve the south-west by connecting Montparnasse station to Porte de Vanves. The aim was to connect Line B with Line C, but the CMP renamed Line B as Line 13 and Line C as Line 14. Both were connected by the RATP as the current Line 13.\n\nLine A was inaugurated on 4 November 1910, after being postponed because of floods in January that year. Line B was inaugurated on 26 February 1911. Because of the high construction costs, the construction of line C was postponed. Nord-Sud and CMP used compatible trains that could be used on both networks, but CMP trains used 600 volts third rail, and NS −600 volts overhead wire and +600 volts third rail. This was necessary because of steep gradients on NS lines. NS distinguished itself from its competitor with the high-quality decoration of its stations, the trains' extreme comfort and pretty lighting.\n\nNord-Sud did not become profitable and bankruptcy became unavoidable. By the end of 1930, the CMP bought Nord-Sud. Line A became Line 12 and Line B Line 13. Line C was built and renamed Line 14; that line was reorganised in 1937 with Lines 8 and 10. This partial line is now the south part of Line 13.\n\nThe last Nord-Sud train set was decommissioned on 15 May 1972.[28]\n\nBienvenüe's project was nearly completed during the 1920s. Paris planned three new lines and extensions of most lines to the inner suburbs, despite the reluctance of Parisians. Bienvenüe's inner circular line having been abandoned, the already-built portion between Duroc and Odéon for the creation of a new east–west line that became Line 10, extended west to Porte de Saint-Cloud and the inner suburbs of Boulogne.\n\nThe line C planned by Nord-Sud between Montparnasse station and Porte de Vanves was built as Line 14 (different from present Line 14). It extended north in encompassing the already-built portion between Invalides and Duroc, initially planned as part of the inner circular. The over-busy Belleville funicular tramway would be replaced by a new line, Line 11, extended to Châtelet. Lines 10, 11 and 14 were thus the three new lines envisaged under this plan.\n\nMost lines would be extended to the inner suburbs. The first to leave the city proper was Line 9, extended in 1934 to Boulogne-Billancourt; more followed in the 1930s. World War II forced authorities to abandon projects such as the extension of Line 4 and Line 12 to the northern suburbs. By 1949, eight lines had been extended: Line 1 to Neuilly-sur-Seine and Vincennes, Line 3 to Levallois-Perret, Line 5 to Pantin, Line 7 to Ivry-sur-Seine, Line 8 to Charenton, Line 9 to Boulogne-Billancourt, Line 11 to Les Lilas and Line 12 to Issy-les-Moulineaux.\n\nWorld War II had a massive impact on the Métro. Services were limited and many stations closed. The risk of bombing meant the service between Place d'Italie and Étoile was transferred from Line 5 to Line 6, so that most of the elevated portions of the Métro would be on Line 6.[clarification needed] As a result, Lines 2 and 6 now form a circle. Most stations were too shallow to be used as bomb shelters. The French Resistance used the tunnels to conduct swift assaults throughout Paris.\n\nIt took a long time to recover after liberation in 1944. Many stations had not reopened by the 1960s and some closed for good.[citation needed] On 23 March 1948, the CMP (the underground) and the STCRP (bus and tramways) merged to form the RATP, which still operates the Métro.\n\nThe network grew saturated during the 1950s. Outdated technology limited the number of trains, which led the RATP to stop extending lines and concentrate on modernisation. The MP 51 prototype was built, testing both rubber-tyred metro and basic automatic driving on the voie navette. The first replacements of the older Sprague trains began with experimental articulated trains and then with mainstream rubber-tyred Métro MP 55 and MP 59, some of the latter still in service (Line 11). Thanks to newer trains and better signalling, trains ran more frequently.\n\nThe population boomed from 1950 to 1980. Car ownership became more common and suburbs grew further from the centre of Paris. The main railway stations, termini of the suburban rail lines, were overcrowded during rush hour.[citation needed] The short distance between Métro stations slowed the network and made it unprofitable to build extensions. The solution in the 1960s was to revive a project abandoned at the end of the 19th century[citation needed]: joining suburban lines to new underground portions in the city centre as the Réseau Express Régional (regional express network; RER).\n\nThe RER plan initially included one east–west line and two north–south lines. RATP bought two unprofitable SNCF lines—the Ligne de Saint-Germain (westbound) and the Ligne de Vincennes (eastbound) with the intention of joining them and to serve multiple districts of central Paris with new underground stations. The new line created by this merger became Line A. The Ligne de Sceaux, which served the southern suburbs and was bought by the CMP in the 1930s, would be extended north to merge with a line of the SNCF and reach the new Charles de Gaulle Airport in Roissy. This became Line B. These new lines were inaugurated in 1977 and their wild success outperformed all the most optimistic forecasts to the extent that line A is the most used urban rail line in Europe with nearly 300 million journeys a year.[citation needed]\n\nBecause of the enormous cost of these two lines, the third planned line was abandoned and the authorities decided that later developments of the RER network would be more cheaply developed by the SNCF, alongside its continued management of other suburban lines. However, the RER developed by the SNCF would never match the success of the RATP's two RER lines. In 1979, the SNCF developed Line C by joining the suburban lines of the Gare d'Austerlitz and Gare d'Orsay, the latter being converted into a museum dedicated to impressionist paintings. During the 1980s, it developed Line D, which was the second line planned by the initial RER schedule, but serving Châtelet instead of République to reduce costs. A huge Métro-RER hub was created at Châtelet–Les Halles, becoming one of the world's largest underground stations.[30]\n\nThe same project of the 1960s also decided to merge Line 13 and Line 14 to create a quick connection between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as a new north–south line. Distances between stations on the lengthened line 13 differ from that on other lines in order to make it more \"express\" and hence to extend it farther in the suburbs. The new Line 13 was inaugurated on 9 November 1976.\n\nIn October 1998, Line 14 was inaugurated. It was the first fully new Métro line in 63 years. Known during its conception as Météor (Métro Est-Ouest Rapide), it was the first of the now three fully automatic lines within the network, along with Line 1 and Line 4. It was the first with platform screen doors to prevent suicides and accidents. It was conceived with extensions to the suburbs in mind, similar to the extensions of the line 13 built during the 1970s. As a result, most of the stations are at least a kilometre apart. Like the RER lines designed by the RATP, nearly all stations offer connections with multiple Métro lines. The line initially ran between Saint-Lazare and Olympiades and was subsequently extended north to Mairie de St.Ouen in 2020.\n\nLines 13 and 7 are the only two on the network to be split in branches. The RATP would like to get rid of those saturated branches in order to improve the network's efficiency.[citation needed] A project existed to attribute to line 14 one branch of each line, and to extend them further into the suburbs. This project was abandoned. In 1999, the RER Line E was inaugurated. Known during its conception as Eole (Est-Ouest Liaison Express), it is the fifth RER line. It terminates at Haussmann–Saint-Lazare, but a new project, financed by EPAD, the public authority managing the La Défense business district, should extend it west to La Défense–Grande Arche and the suburbs beyond.\n\nBetween 2007 and November 2011, Line 1 was converted to driverless operation. The line was operated with a combination of driver-operated trains and driverless trains until the delivery of the last of its driverless MP 05 trains in February 2013. The same conversion for Line 4 was completed on 13 January 2022, with the last non-automatic train removed from that line on 17 December 2023, and RATP would now like to automate Line 13.[31][32] Line 14 was automated from Day 1,[33] as will the lines 15 to 18 which are being built as part of the Grand Paris Express.\n\nSeveral extensions to the suburbs opened in the last years. Line 8 was extended to Pointe du Lac in 2011, line 12 was extended to Aubervilliers in 2012, line 4 was extended to Mairie de Montrouge in 2013, Line 14 was extended by 5.8 km (3.6 mi) to Mairie de Saint-Ouen in December 2020, and Line 4 was extended to Bagneux in January 2022.\n• July – October 1995: Paris Métro bombings (terror attack), committed by Algerian extremists – 8 killed and more than 100 injured.\n• 30 August 2000: an MF 67 train derailed due to excessive speed and unavailable automatic cruising at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, 24 slightly injured.[ ]\n• 6 August 2005: fire broke out on a train at Simplon, injuring at least 19 people. Early reports blamed an electrical short circuit as the cause.[ ]\n• 29 July 2007: a fire started on a train between Varenne and Invalides. Fifteen people were injured.[ ]\n\nSince the Métro was built to comprehensively serve the city inside its walls, the stations are very close: 548 metres (1,798 ft) apart on average, from 424 metres (1,391 ft) on Line 4 to 1,158 metres (3,799 ft) on the newer line 14, meaning Paris is densely networked with stations. The surrounding suburbs are served by later line extensions, thus traffic from one suburb to another must pass through the city (the circular line 15, now under construction, will enable some journeys that do not need to pass through Paris). The slow average speed effectively prohibits service to the greater Paris area.\n\nThe Métro is mostly underground (225.2 km or 139.9 mi of 245.6 km or 152.6 mi). Above-ground sections consist of elevated railway viaducts within Paris (on Lines 1, 2, 5 and 6) and the at-level suburban ends of Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13. The tunnels are relatively close to the surface due to the variable nature of the terrain, which complicates deep digging; exceptions include parts of Line 12 under the hill of Montmartre and line 2 under Ménilmontant. The tunnels mostly follow the twists and turns of the streets above. During construction in 1900, a minimum radius of curvature of just 75 metres (246 ft) was imposed, but even this low standard was not adhered to at Bastille and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.\n\nLike the New York City Subway, and in contrast with the London Underground, the Paris Métro mostly uses two-way tunnels. As in most French metro and tramway systems, trains drive on the right (SNCF trains run on the left track). The tracks are 1,435 mm ( 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in) standard gauge. Electric power is supplied by a third rail which carries 750 volts DC.\n\nThe width of the carriages, 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in), is narrower than that of newer French systems (such as the 2.9-metre or 9-foot-6-inch carriages in Lyon)[37] and trains on Lines 1, 4 and 14 have capacities of 600–700 passengers; this is as compared with 2,600 on the Altéo MI 2N trains of RER A. The City of Paris deliberately chose to build narrow Métro tunnels to prevent the running of mainline trains; the city of Paris and the French state had historically poor relations. In contrast to many other historical metro systems (such as New York, Madrid, London, and Boston), all lines have tunnels and operate trains with the same dimensions. Five Paris Métro Lines (1, 4, 6, 11 and 14) run on a rubber tire system developed by the RATP in the 1950s, exported to the Montreal, Santiago, Mexico City and Lausanne metro.\n\nThe number of cars in each train varies line by line. The shortest are lines 3bis and 7bis with three-car trains. Line 11 ran with four until the summer 2023 when four-car MP 59 trains, the oldest type in service at the time, were gradually replaced by new five-car MP 14 trains (at a pace of 3 to 5 new MP 14 every Monday). Lines 1 and 4 run six-car trains. Line 14 currently runs a mix of six and 8-car trains; in the future it will only run 8 cars. All other lines run with five. Two lines, 7 and 13, have branches at the end, and Line 10 has a one-way loop. Trains serve every station on each line except when they are closed for renovations.\n\nThe first train leaves each terminus at 5:30 a.m. On some lines additional trains start from an intermediate station. The last train, often called the \"balai\" (broom) because it sweeps up remaining passengers, arrives at the terminus at 1:15 a.m., except on Fridays (since 7 December 2007),[38] Saturdays and on nights before a holiday, when the service ends at 2:15 a.m.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Fête de la Musique, Nuit Blanche and other events, some stations on Lines 1, 4, 6, 9 and 14 remain open all night.\n\nTickets are sold at staffed counters and at automated machines in the station foyer. Entrance to platforms is by automated gate, opened by smart cards and paper tickets. Gates return tickets for passengers to retain for the duration of the journey. There is normally no system to collect or check tickets at the end of the journey, and tickets can be inspected at any point. The exit from all stations is clearly marked as to the point beyond which possession of a ticket is no longer required.\n\nThe standard ticket for a single trip is the Ticket t+. It is valid for a multi-transfer journey within 90 minutes from the first validation. It can be used on the Métro (excluding Orly Airport), buses and trams, and in zone 1 of the RER. It allows unlimited transfers between the same mode of transport (i.e. Métro to Métro, bus to bus and tram to tram), between bus and tram, and between Métro and RER zone 1. The ticket is available in paper form, or can be loaded onto a Navigo Easy pass. As of 2024, it costs €2.15 per ticket, and is also available as a pack of ten tickets (a carnet) for €17.35 on Navigo Easy.[39]\n\nDaily, weekly, and monthly passes are available for users of a Navigo card, an RFID-based contactless smart card. Daily tickets are also available as paper tickets until the end of 2024.\n\nParis Visite is a paper ticket aimed at visitors offering unlimited trips for a duration of one, two, three or five days, for zones 1–3 covering the centre of Paris, or zones 1–5 covering the whole of the network including the RER to the airports, Versailles and Disneyland Paris.\n\nA single ticket to or from Orly Airport on Métro line 14 costs €10.30.\n\nOn 26 June 2012, it was announced that the Métro would get Wi-Fi in most stations. Access provided would be free, with a premium paid alternative offer proposed for a faster internet connection.[40] As of 2020, the entire RATP network was connected with 4G service, including within tunnels.[41] The automated Line 1, Line 4 and Line 14 – as well as some congested stations on Line 13 – have platform edge doors ('porte palière') separating the tracks from the platform.\n\nThe vast majority of Métro stations are not accessible to all.[42][43] The 20 stations of Line 14 (which first opened in 1998) are fully accessible, and all line extensions since 1992 have included lifts at the new stations.[44] By 2025, 23 stations on the Métro will be accessible, following extensions to existing lines.[45] The four new lines of the Grand Paris Express will also be fully accessible from day 1.[46][47]\n\nThe Law on Equal Rights and Opportunities, Participation and Citizenship of Persons with Disabilities of 2005 [fr] does not require the Métro to be made accessible.[43][48] RATP estimates that retrofitting the network would cost between 4 and 6 billion euros, and that certain stations would remain impossible to retrofit.[49][43] As of 2022 , there were no plans to retrofit existing stations with lifts.[50][48] RATP notes that buses and trams in Paris are fully accessible, and many RER & Transilien stations are accessible.[51]\n\nThe Métro has 245.6 kilometres (152.6 mi) of track[3] and 321 stations,[1] 61 connecting between lines. These figures do not include the RER network. The average distance between stations is 562 m (1,844 ft). Trains stop at all stations.[52] Lines do not share tracks, even at interchange (transfer) stations.[37]\n\nTrains had a maximum permitted speed of 70 km/h (43 mph) and averaged 25.1 km/h (15.6 mph) at peak times as of 2018.[53] The fastest lines were the automated ones: Line 14, which averaged 38.9 km/h (24.2 mph),[53] and Line 1, which averaged 30 km/h (19 mph).[54] Trains travel on the right. The track is standard gauge but the loading gauge is smaller than the mainline SNCF network. Power is from a lateral third rail, 750 V DC, except on the rubber-tyred lines where the current is from guide bars.[37]\n\nThe loading gauge is small compared to those of newer metro systems (but comparable to that of early European metros), with capacities of between about 560 and 720 passengers per train on Lines 1–14. Many other metro systems (such as those of New York and London) adopted expanded tunnel dimensions for their newer lines (or used tunnels of multiple sizes almost from the outset, in the case of Boston), at the cost of operating incompatible fleets of rolling stock. Paris built all lines to the same dimensions as its original lines. Before the introduction of rubber-tire lines in the 1950s, this common shared size theoretically allowed any Métro rolling stock to operate on any line, but in practice each line was assigned a regular roster of trains.[citation needed]\n\nA feature is the use of rubber-tired trains on five lines: this technique was developed by RATP and entered service in 1951. The technology was exported to many networks around the world (including Montreal, Mexico City and Santiago). Lines 1, 4, 6, 11 and 14 have special adaptations to accommodate rubber-tyred trains. Trains are composed of 3 to 8 cars depending on the line, the most common being 5 cars, but all trains on the same line have the same number of cars.\n\nThe Métro is designed to provide local, point-to-point service in Paris proper and service into the city from some close suburbs. Stations within Paris are very close together to form a grid structure, ensuring that every point in the city is close to a Métro station (less than 500 metres or 1,640 feet), at the cost of speed, except on Line 14 where the stations are farther apart and the trains travel faster. The system is complemented by the RER, which extends farther out into the suburbs and functions as an express network for the city and its surroundings.\n\nThe Paris Métro runs mostly underground; surface sections include sections on viaducts in Paris (Lines 1, 2, 5, and 6) and at the surface in the suburbs (Lines 1, 5, 8, and 13). In most cases, both tracks are laid in a single tunnel. Almost all lines follow roads, having been built by the cut-and-cover method near the surface (the earliest by hand). Line 1 follows the straight course of the Champs-Elysées and on other lines, some stations (Liège, Commerce) have platforms that do not align: the street above is too narrow to fit both platforms opposite each other. Many lines have very sharp curves. The specifications established in 1900 required a very low minimum curve radius by railway standards, but even this was often not fully respected, for example near Bastille and Notre Dame de Lorette. Parts of the network are built at depth, in particular a section of Line 12 under Montmartre, the sections under the Seine, and all of Line 14.\n\nLines 7 and 13 have two terminal branches, while line 7bis runs in a unidirectional loop at one end. One end of lines 2 and 5 each and both ends of line 6 have their terminus station on a balloon loop. One end of lines 3bis and 7bis each have their trains essentially operate this way, but instead reverse. One end of lines 2, 3bis, and 4 have trains run out of service on a balloon loop before reentering service. All other termini have trains continue a certain distance beyond the terminal, before proceeding back to the station on a different platform headed the other way.\n\nThe rolling stock has steel wheels (MF for matériel fer) and rubber-tyred trains (MP for matériel pneu). The different versions of each kind are specified by year of design. Some trains have suffixes to differentiate between them – CC (Conduite Conducteur) for trains driven by a driver and CA (Conduite Automatique) for trains that are automatically driven.\n• No longer in service\n• M1: in service from 1900 until 1931.\n• Sprague-Thomson: in service from 1908 until 1983.\n• MA 51: in service on lines 10 and 13 until 1994.\n• MP 55: in service on Line 11 from 1956 until 1999, replaced by the MP 59.\n• MP 59: in service from 1963 until 2024, replaced by the MP 14.\n• Zébulon a prototype MF 67, used for training operators between 1968 and 2010. It never saw passenger service.\n• Not yet in service\n• MF 19: intended to replace the MF 67, MF 77 and MF 88 stocks on Lines 3, 3bis, 7, 7bis, 8, 10, 12 and 13.\n• MR3V/MR6V: intended to serve on line 15 (MR6V) and on lines 16 and 17 (MR3V).\n\nThe typical station comprises two central tracks flanked by two four-metre wide platforms. About 50 stations, generally current or former termini, are exceptions; most have three tracks and two platforms (Porte d'Orléans), or two tracks and a central platform (Porte Dauphine). Some stations are single-track, either due to difficult terrain (Saint-Georges), a narrow street above (Liège) or track loops (Église d'Auteuil).\n\nStation length was originally 75 m (246 ft), enough to accommodate the 5-car trains used on most lines. This was extended to 90 m (295 ft) on high-traffic lines (Line 1 and Line 4) which operate six-car trains, with some stations at 105 m (344 ft) for accommodating seven-car trains (the difference as yet unused).\n\nIn general, stations were built near the surface by the cut-and-cover method, and are vaulted. Stations of the former Nord-Sud network (Line 12 and Line 13) have higher ceilings, due to the former presence of a ceiling catenary. There are exceptions to the rule of near-surface vaulting:\n• Stations particularly close to the surface, generally on Line 1 (Champs-Elysées–Clémenceau), have flat metal ceilings.\n• Elevated (above street) stations, in particular on Line 2 and Line 6, are built in brick and covered by platform awnings (Line 2) or glass canopies (Line 6).\n• Stations on the newest sections (Line 14), built at depth, comprise 120 m (394 ft) platforms for eight-car trains, high ceilings and double-width platforms. Since the trains on this line are driverless, the stations have platform screen doors. Platform screen doors have been introduced on Line 1 and Line 4 as well since the MP 05 trains have been functioning.\n\nSeveral ghost stations are no longer served by trains. One of the three platforms at Porte des Lilas station is on a currently unused section of track, often used as a backdrop in films.\n\nIn 2018, the busiest stations were Saint-Lazare (46.7 million passengers), Gare du Nord (45.8), Gare de Lyon (36.9), Montparnasse – Bienvenüe (30.6), Gare de l'Est (21.4), Bibliothèque François Mitterrand (18.8), République (18.3), Les Halles (17.5), La Défense (16.0) and Bastille (13.2).[59]\n\nConcourses are decorated in Art Nouveau style defined at the Métro's opening in 1900. The spirit of this aesthetic has generally been respected in renovations.\n\nStandard vaulted stations are lined by small white earthenware tiles, chosen because of the poor efficiency of early twentieth century electric lighting. From the outset walls have been used for advertising; posters in early stations are framed by coloured tiles with the name of the original operator (CMP or Nord Sud). Stations of the former Nord Sud (most of line 12 and parts of line 13) generally have more meticulous decoration. Station names are usually inscribed on metallic plaques in white letters on a blue background or in white tiles on a background of blue tiles.\n\nThe first renovations took place after the Second World War, when the installation of fluorescent lighting revealed the poor state of the original tiling. Three main styles of redecoration followed in succession.\n• Between 1948 and 1967 the RATP installed standardised coloured metallic wall casings in 73 stations.\n• From the end of the 1960s a new style was rolled out in around 20 stations, known as Mouton-Duvernet after the first station concerned. The white tiles were replaced to a height of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) with non-bevelled tiles in various shades of orange. Intended to be warm and dynamic, the renovations proved unpopular. The decoration has been removed as part of the \"Renouveau du métro\" programme.\n• From 1975 some stations were redecorated in the Motte style, which emphasised the original white tiling but brought touches of colour to light fixtures, seating and the walls of connecting tunnels. The subsequent Ouï Dire style features audaciously shaped seats and light housings with complementary multicoloured uplighting.\n\nA number of stations have original decorations to reflect the cultural significance of their locations. The first to receive this treatment was Louvre – Rivoli on line 1, which contains copies of the masterpieces on display at the museum. Other notable examples include Bastille (line 1), Saint-Germain-des-Prés (line 4), Cluny – La Sorbonne (line 10) and Arts et Métiers (line 11).\n\nThe original Art Nouveau entrances are iconic symbols of Paris. There are currently 83 of them. Designed by Hector Guimard in a style that caused some surprise and controversy in 1900, there are two main variants:\n• The most elaborate feature glass canopies. Two original canopies still exist, at Porte Dauphine and Abbesses (originally located at until moved in the 1970s). A replica of the canopy at Abbesses was installed at Châtelet station at the intersection of Rue des Halles and Rue Sainte-Opportune.\n• A cast-iron balustrade decorated in plant-like motifs, accompanied by a \"Métropolitain\" sign supported by two orange globes atop ornate cast-iron supports in the form of plant stems.\n• Several of the iconic Guimard entrances have been given to other cities. The only original one on a metro station outside Paris is at Square-Victoria-OACI station in Montreal, as a monument to the collaboration of RATP engineers. Replicas cast from the original moulds have been given to the Lisbon Metro (Picoas station); the Mexico City Metro (Metro Bellas Artes, with a \"Metro\" sign), offered as a gift in return for a Huichol mural displayed at Palais Royal – Musée du Louvre; and Chicago Metra (Van Buren Street, at South Michigan Avenue and East Van Buren Street, with a \"Metra\" sign), given in 2001. The Moscow Metro has a Guimard entrance at Kievskaya station, donated by the RATP in 2006. There is an entrance on display at the Sculpture Garden in Downtown Washington, D.C. This does not lead to a metro station, it is just for pleasure. Similarly, The Museum of Modern Art has an original, restored Guimard entrance outdoors in the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. 8\n\nLater stations and redecorations have brought increasingly simple styles to entrances.\n• Classical stone balustrades were chosen for some early stations in prestigious locations (Franklin D. Roosevelt, République).\n• Simpler metal balustrades accompany a \"Métro\" sign crowned by a spherical lamp in other early stations (Saint-Placide).\n• Minimalist stainless-steel balustrades (Havre-Caumartin) appeared from the 1970s and signposts with just an \"M\" have been the norm since the war (Olympiades, opened 2007).\n\nA handful of entrances have original architecture (Saint-Lazare); a number are integrated into residential or standalone buildings (Pelleport).\n• As part of the Grand Paris Express project: 60\n• The first (southern) section of future Line 15 between Pont de Sèvres and Noisy–Champs. This section is 33 km (21 mi) long and will have sixteen stations. 61 60 Opening is currently planned for 2025. 62 63\n• The first (northern) section of future Line 16 between Saint-Denis–Pleyel and Clichy–Montfermeil with seven new stations. 60 Opening is currently planned for 2026. 64 63\n• The first (southern) section of future Line 17 between Le Bourget and Le Bourget–Aéroport with one new station. 60 Opening is currently planned for 2026. 65 63\n• The first (central) section of future Line 18 between Aéroport d'Orly and Christ de Saclay with seven new stations. Opening is currently planned in two phases for 2026 & 2027.\n\nThe original Grand Paris Express plans had a total span of 200 kilometres (124 mi) and counted 68 stations, the completion of which forms the major part of the currently planned lines.[66][63]\n• Line 15, the longest of the new Grand Paris Express lines, will be a circular line around Paris when completed in 2031.\n• The second (southern) section of Line 16 between Clichy–Montfermeil and Noisy–Champs will open in 2028.\n• Line 17 will be additionally extended in two phases in 2028 & 2030 to Le Mesnil-Amelot, running through Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n• Line 18 will be extended to the north, to Versailles Chantiers, by 2030.\n\nIn addition to the projects already under construction or currently being actively studied, there have also been proposals for:\n• An extension of Line 1 from Château de Vincennes to Val de Fontenay, connecting to RER and future Line 15 in 2035. 67\n• An extension of Line 3 to Bécon-les-Bruyères.\n• An extension of Line 5 to Place de Rungis (south) and Drancy (north), as well as a new infill station (Bobigny–La Folie).\n• An extension of Line 7 to Mairie de Drancy.\n• An extension of Line 9 to Montreuil–Hôpital.\n• An extension of Line 10 from Boulogne–Pont de Saint-Cloud to Saint-Cloud.\n• An extension of Line 10 from Gare d'Austerlitz to Ivry–Place Gambetta or even Les Ardoines, the latter connecting to RER and future Line 15 (around 2030 to 2035). 68\n• An extension of Line 11 to Noisy–Champs as part of the Grand Paris Express.\n• An extension of Line 12 to Meudon-sur-Seine (south) and La Courneuve–6 Routes (north).\n• An extension of Line 13's Saint-Denis-Université branch to Stains la Cerisaie and Les Courtilles branch to Port de Gennevilliers.\n• An extension of Line 17 south to Nanterre–La Folie, under study for completion after 2030 as part of the Grand Paris Express.\n• An extension of Line 18 north to Nanterre–La Folie, under study for completion after 2030 as part of the Grand Paris Express.\n• In 2023, the Grand Paris Express plans were extended with the addition of Line 19, serving Val-d'Oise on a route from Nanterre–La Folie to Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV, under study for a completion around 2040.\n• A merger of Line 3bis and Line 7bis to form a new line.\n\nThe Métro has a cultural significance in the arts that goes well beyond Paris. The term \"metro\" has become a generic name for subways and urban underground railways.\n\nThe station entrance kiosks, designed by Hector Guimard, fostered Art Nouveau building style (once widely known as \"le style Métro\"); however, some French commentators criticised the Guimard station kiosks, including their green colour and sign lettering, as difficult to read.\n\nThe success of rubber-tired lines led to their export to metro systems around the world, starting with the Montreal Metro. The success of Montreal \"did much to accelerate the international subway boom\" of the 1960s/1970s and \"assure the preeminence of the French in the process\". Rubber-tired systems were adopted in Mexico City, Santiago, Lausanne, Turin, Singapore and other cities. The Japanese adopted rubber-tired metros (with their own technology and manufacturing firms) to systems in Kobe, Sapporo, as well as parts of Tokyo.\n\nThe \"Rabbit of the Paris Métro\" is an anthropomorphic rabbit visible on stickers on the doors of the trains since 1977 to advise passengers (especially children) of the risk of getting one's hands trapped when the doors are opening, as well as the risk of injury on escalators or becoming trapped in the closing doors. This rabbit is now a popular icon in Paris similar to the \"mind the gap\" phrase in London.‎Paris Metro Map and Routes: Paris metro map within an interactive transport app. Paris Metro is the best navigation tool for travelling around the French capital with offline routing, train times and lots of essential journey information.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n\n\nInteractive map of the Paris metro system, tram lines and RER lines within central Paris.\n\nEasy to search for a metro station or simply view the nearest metro stations to wherever you are in Paris.\n\nAn easy to use journey planner that works with and without an internet connection.\n\nEach route gives details on how long your journey will take and how many metro stations you will pass through.\n\nWith step-by-step directions shown on the metro map, travelling around Paris is simple and stress-free.\n\nPlan routes to popular Paris points of interest such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre and Notre Dame.\n\nView train times to see how long you’ll be waiting with departure boards for each station.\n\nSave your favourite routes for quick selection when on the go.\n\nSave you Home and Work stations for up to date station, line and route information.\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive Paris Metro features available as subscriptions:\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting early or finishing late?

The municipality of Beauvechain is made since 1976 of the former municipalities of Beauvechain (1,263 ha), Hamme-Mille (824 ha), L'Ecluse (Sluizen; 380 ha), Nodebais (538 ha) and Tourinnes-la-Grosse (Deurne; 854 ha).\n\nThe territory of Beauvechain was already settled in the Neolithic, as proved by hewed flints found on a sandy mound in Hamme-Mille and tombs found near the Saint-Nicaise forest. In the Roman times, it was crossed by the Boulogne-Cologne way.\n\n The first organized village of Beauvechain dates back to the Frankish times. St. Ermelinde (d. 600) is said to have lived in Beauvechain, which is named after St. Bavo (as \"bavoheim\", Bavo's estate). The villages were sacked at the end of the IXth century by Northmen coming from a camp near Leuven. At the end of the Xth century, Countess Alpayde ceded the villages to Notger, Prince-Bishop of Liège. In 1013, the battle of Hoegaarden opposed the Count of Leuven to the Prince-Bishop of Liège. Accordingly, Hamme, L'Ecluse, Mille and Nodebais were incorporated to the County of Leuven, whereas Beauvechain and Tourinnes remained to Liège, forming enclaves within the Duchy of Brabant for the next seven centuries. Around 1230, Duke of Brabant Henri II founded in Hamme the Cistercian womens' abbey of Val-Duc, ran by the abbey of Villers; the abbey was burned in 1667 and sacked several times during the next years, as were the villages (Beauvechain in 1693, Hamme in 1707).\n\n Mille was incorporated to Hamme by an Imperial Decree in 1811; Beauvechin and Tourinnes were separated by a Law in 1841. In the middle of the XIXth century, several villagers emigrated to Wisconsin (USA), where there is still a significant Walloon-speaking community.\n\nThe Air Force Base Lieutenant Colonel Aviateur Charles Roman of Beauvechain, founded in 1936, houses the 1st Wing, made of the 5th (flying on Marchetti SF-260) and 7th (flying in the last four Fouga Magister still used in the world) Flight Squadrons. It is mostly used as a training center for the pilots. The base of Beauvechain also houses the Wing Meteo and the Air Force Band. It employs 1,100, being therefore the second employer of Walloon Brabant.\n\n The airfields of Les Burettes and Le Culot were set up in 1936 by the Air Force. On 10 May 1940, the German Luftwaffe attacked the two airfields and destroyed several Hurricane and Gladiator aircrafts. The Germans revamped Le Culot, which was bombed by the Allied air forces in January 1944. The US Air Force settled in the airfield from October 1944 to June 1945. After the liberation, the Spitfire flying squadrons created inside the RAF were relocated to Beauvechain, where they formed on 1 February 1948 the 1st Fighters Wing, including four squadrons. The first F-16 arrived in Beauvechain in January 1979. The 1st Fighters Wing was disbanded on 4 March 1996 and its squadrons were relocated in Florennes and Kleine Brogel. The 1st Wing was formed with two squadrons relocated from Gossoncourt and Brustem.\n\nThe municipal flag of Beauvechain is yellow with two red stakes placed horizontally and reaching the second third of the flag width.\n\n According to Armoiries communales en Belgique. Communes wallonnes, bruxelloises et germanophones, the flag was adopted by the Municipal Council on 18 September 1995 and confirmed by the Executive of the French Community on 28 March 1997, as:\n\n Jaune palissé longitudinalement de deux pièces rouges se terminant au deuxième tiers du battant.\n\n The flag is made of the dexter part of the municipal arms.\n\nThe arms of Beauvechain are;\n\n D'or palissé en fasce de deux pièces de gueules, senestré de sable à une crosse abbatiale d'or, le crosseron tourné à senestre (Or urdy two pieces gules the sinister side sable an abbot's crozier or).\n\n François Velde's glossary shows this partition of the shield as palissadé and not palissé, which is translated as \"urdy\" or \"palissado\".\n\n The partition recalls that Beauvechain is made of five former municipalities, two from the Principality of Liège and the two other ones from the County of Leuven (represented by the colours yellow and red, respectively, I presume). The partition also recalls the letter B. The crozier recalls both the Bishop of Liège and the abbey of Val-Duc in Hamme-Mille.Beauvechain - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Beauvechain (en valón Bôvètché, en neerlandés Bevekom ) es un municipio francófono y una localidad de Bélgica localizado en la provincia del Brabante Valón en la Región Valona.

The man told Dr. Dukan he could give up anything if it would help him lose weight — except for meat.\n\nThe “true weight” calculation considers your sex, age, weight loss history, and a variety of other factors. This number will then be your goal.\n\nThe Dukan diet contains four phases designed to help you meet your goal weight. The length of time each phase lasts depends on your “true weight.”\n\nThe first phase kicks the diet off with a heavy amount of lean protein. It can last from one to seven days, depending on how much weight you need to lose.\n\nIn the second phase, you can start adding nonstarchy vegetables to your eating plan. You’ll alternate between one day of only lean protein and one day of lean protein mixed with nonstarchy vegetables, plus you’ll increase to a 2-tbsp serving of oat bran per day.\n\nAfter the first two phases have helped you lose weight, the Consolidation phase gradually introduces more food groups. This phase lasts five days for every pound lost and aims to prevent rebound weight gain.\n\nThe final phase lasts indefinitely and is meant to help you keep the weight off. It’s very similar to the Consolidation phase, but allows you to be a little looser with the carbs and fats.Dukan Diet - Wikipedia: The Dukan Diet is a high-protein low-carbohydrate fad diet devised by Pierre Dukan.[1]\n\nThe Dukan diet is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet with four phases, each of which has specific rules.[2][3]\n\nIn 1975, Pierre Dukan was a general practitioner in Paris when he was first confronted with a case of obesity. At the time, being overweight or obese was thought to be best treated by low calorie and small sized meals. Dukan thought of an alternative way to prevent patients from regaining their lost weight. He designed a new approach in four phases, including stabilisation and consolidation. After more than 20 years of research Pierre Dukan published his findings in 2000 in his book Je ne sais pas maigrir (I don't know how to get slimmer), which became a best seller.\n\nIn July 2011, a French court ruled against Dukan in his attempt to sue rival nutritionist Jean-Michel Cohen for libel, after Cohen had criticised his method in the press.[4]\n\nIn 2013, Dukan, then aged 72, was banned from practising as a GP in France for eight days for breaching medical ethics by prescribing a diet pill to one of his patients in the 1970s that was later pulled from the market.[5]\n\nPierre Dukan said the paleo diet was a copy of his weight loss strategy.[6] The paleo diet is claimed to be based on the human ancestral diet. Other similar diets include the ketogenic diet, being low carb, moderate protein, and high fats; and the Atkins diet, being low carb, high protein, and moderate fats.\n\nDukan has been promoting his diet since the 1970s; it gained a wider audience after the 2000 publication of his book, The Dukan Diet, which has sold more than 7 million copies globally.[7][8] The book was released in the United Kingdom in May 2010, and in the United States in April 2011.\n\nThe French magazine L'Express' list of the 20 top-selling non-fiction books for the week of 27 December 2010 ranked La méthode Dukan illustrée in 19th place.\n\nChannel Four included the diet in the programme Will my crash diet kill me? on 26 January 2011.[9]\n\nThe American spokesperson for the diet is culinary dietitian Gina Keatley.[10]\n\nThe Dukan diet is categorized as a commercial fad diet and carries some risk of causing chronic kidney disease and worsened cardiovascular health.[11] It is unclear whether it helps people lose weight or increase their glucose tolerance.[11] Nephrolithiasis is a potential side effect of the diet that is of particular concern to people with a history of kidney stone formation.[11]\n\nThe British Dietetic Association have named the Dukan Diet the number 1 \"diet to avoid\".[12]Dukan Diet Review: Phases, Menu, & More: What Is the Dukan Diet? Most people who lose weight regain more than half of it within 2 years and gain back nearly all of it within 5 years. The Dukan diet is a high-protein, very low-carbohydrate eating plan that promises to help you lose weight and \"keep it off forever.\" This diet was created in 2000 by French doctor and nutritionist Pierre Dukan. It's a four-step plan that cuts carbohydrates and fat and boosts protein to supposedly promote long-term weight loss. In the first phases, you're limited to 100 foods, but you can eat as much of them as you'd like.\n\nHow Does the Dukan Diet Work? The first two phases of the Dukan diet promote weight loss with a high-protein, no-carb diet. Eating this way puts your body into a state of ketosis, where you burn fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. In the third phase, the goal is to maintain the weight loss while slowly reintroducing some of the foods you cut. Phase four aims to keep the weight off long-term with a generally healthy diet that includes one all-protein day each week. The Dukan diet is basically an elimination diet. It cuts certain carbs to promote weight loss. This is how the Dukan diet claims to work, but everyone responds differently to diet plans. Even the diet's website includes the disclaimer, \"Results may vary for each person.\" The Dukan diet's claims are not backed by WebMD. Talk to your doctor before you start any new diet to make sure that it's safe for you.\n\nHow Do I Start the Dukan Diet? The first phase of the diet is only protein. You may want to clear your fridge and pantry of carbs to resist the temptation. Shop for protein-based foods such as: Also, get oat bran to supply you with fiber and carbs. So that you don't have to run to the store again in a few days, you might also want to have vegetables in your fridge for the next phase of the diet. You can include a variety of non-starchy vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, onion, tomato, kale, and mushrooms.\n\nThe first two phases of the Dukan diet are based on elimination. Your food options during these periods are very limited. As the diet progresses, you can add in more food groups. Which foods you're allowed to eat depends on the phase you're in. For the first few days, you can only eat animal proteins, sugar-free gelatin, and oat bran. Then, you can add non-starchy vegetables until you reach your weight-loss goal. The third phase allows fruit, whole-grain bread, and cheese. Plus, you get one to two \"celebration meals\" where you can choose what you want to eat. In the last phase, no foods are off the table, but once a week you eat only protein. Sugar-free gum, artificial sweeteners, spices, and unsweetened coffee and tea are also OK. As for alcohol, you can have a glass of wine per day during the consolidation and stabilization phases. Foods to avoid on the Dukan diet In the first phase, you'll cut everything from your diet except protein. That means no starches such as bread and white rice. They're off-limits until the third phase. So are desserts. In the final phase, you can pretty much eat what you want, except for 1 day a week when you eat nothing but protein. But to maintain weight loss, you're not supposed to go back to old habits such as eating fast food and sweets. This first phase is meant to jump-start weight loss. It's also the most restrictive phase because you can only eat 68 animal proteins, although you can eat as much of them as you want. How long you stay in the attack phase depends on how much weight you want to lose:\n• None Less than 10 pounds: 1 or 2 days\n• None More than 40 pounds: Up to 7 days (but check with your doctor before you stay on the diet for this long) It's recommended that you eat 1.5 tablespoons of oat bran each day for fiber and carbs and drink at least six cups of water daily to stay hydrated. Exercise every day, ideally in the morning. In this phase, you'll continue to lose weight steadily until you reach your goal weight, which Dukan calls your \"true weight.\" The goal is to lose 1 pound every 3 days. How long this takes depends on your current weight and your goal weight. The cruise phase adds 32 non-starchy vegetables to the 68 animal proteins, for a total of 100 allowed foods. You alternate between all-protein days and protein-plus-vegetables days. Continue to eat oat bran. Increase your daily walks to 30 minutes to boost weight loss. The third phase, consolidation, is when you stick to your goal weight. It lasts 5 days for every pound you've lost. If you've dropped 10 pounds, you'll be in this phase for 50 days (about 2 months). You can still eat all 100 foods from the cruise phase in unlimited amounts. Plus, you can have limited amounts of lamb and roast pork, some starchy foods such as bread and rice, hard cheeses, whole-grain bread, and fruit. You can also add one or two celebration meals per week with an appetizer, entrée, dessert, and a glass of wine. Every Thursday, you eat animal protein only. This protein day helps maintain weight loss. Exercise by taking 25-minute fast walks every day. This last phase is designed to maintain the weight loss long-term. You can eat whatever you like, except for 1 day a week when you follow the all-protein rules from the diet's attack phase. In this phase, you also eat 3 tablespoons of oat bran a day and take the stairs whenever possible.\n\nPros and Cons of the Dukan Diet Every diet has pros and cons. Some have more pros than others. And some diets fit better into one person's lifestyle than another's. The goals of the Dukan diet are to help you lose weight and maintain that weight loss long-term. It's hard to know whether this diet really helps with long-term weight loss because there hasn't been much research done on it. In one small study, women lost an average of 33 pounds after 8-10 weeks on this diet. One benefit of the Dukan diet is that you don't have to count calories. You can eat as much as you want, as long as you only eat approved foods. You shouldn't feel hungry because of all the protein in the diet, and lean proteins and vegetables may help improve heart health, blood sugar, and inflammation. The Dukan diet also includes exercise. The activities it recommends are easy for most people to do, such as walking and stair climbing. The Dukan diet is very restrictive. In the first two phases, you have to cut out most food groups, possibly for months. Very restrictive diets can be hard to stick with. And by cutting out fruits and vegetables, you lose important nutrients such as vitamin C and folate. This is a complicated diet because there are so many rules to follow. It's hard to shop for food and plan meals when you can only eat certain foods on certain days. You might not feel good when you start on this diet. The lack of carbs could make you more tired than usual. You need carbs for energy. Putting your body into ketosis can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, tiredness, and diarrhea. These problems should go away in a few days or weeks as your body gets used to the diet. Ketosis can also dehydrate you because your kidneys remove more fluid. The huge amount of protein in this diet can pose health risks. Your kidneys have to filter out the extra protein, which could overload and damage them. Extra protein boosts levels of an amino acid called homocysteine in the blood. High homocysteine levels are linked to blood vessel damage and heart disease. Excess protein also increases the risk for osteoporosis. This diet isn't safe for people with diabetes. Cutting carbs could make your blood sugar harder to control. Prepping your food shouldn't be a problem, and you don't need exotic ingredients. But you will be pretty restricted in what you can eat at the start of the diet. And you'll have to keep up with the changing list of rules in each phase.\n• None Level of limitations: Eating mainly protein and oat bran can get tiresome.\n• None Cooking and shopping: The limited list of ingredients might make shopping easier at first, but you'll have to adapt to the shifting rules in each phase.\n• None Exercise: A daily 20- to 30-minute walk is essential to the plan. Does it allow for dietary restrictions or preferences? Vegetarian or vegan. This diet is based on eating a lot of lean meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, fat-free dairy, and eggs. Seitan, tempeh, and tofu are the veggie protein options available -- beans, nuts, and lentils aren't on the diet's list of allowed foods. On days when all you eat is protein, things can get boring quickly if you don't eat meat. Low-fat diet. If you're already following a low-fat diet or have a heart condition that requires you to eat ultra-low-fat foods, this diet might fit like a glove. The allowed foods — mainly protein, veggies, and fruit — are lean, low-fat, or no-fat. Gluten-free. The earlier phases of the diet may work for a gluten-free diet, but as the rules relax, it's not strictly gluten-free. If you're trying to avoid gluten completely, make it a habit to read food labels carefully. What else you should know Costs. None beyond your shopping, unless you sign up for online coaching, which is optional. The cost varies depending on how much weight you'd like to lose. Support. There's a strong community aspect to this plan. The official website offers sample recipes, inspirational success stories from real people, and coaches to help guide dieters through each phase.\n\nDukan Diet Review: What Our Expert Says You may lose weight at first on the Dukan diet, but registered dietitian nutritionist Kathleen Zelman, MPH, RD, LD, notes that the diet may be too expensive and restrictive to maintain in the long term. \"The rules of this diet are complicated -- and potentially frustrating,\" warns Zelman. The first stages of this diet will likely result in significant weight loss due to the few carbohydrates allowed on the plan. But when you go back to eating normally after reaching your goal weight, you may gain some of this weight back. Zelman points out that one study has shown the Dukan diet may help you lose belly fat in the short term, but the evidence supporting the diet is limited. In general, research shows that high-protein diets are effective for weight loss, but experts still do not know what the long-term effects are for your health and weight. And there is no evidence that having one all-protein day, along with exercise, is enough to maintain your weight loss. Is it good for certain conditions? Although the diet can lead to weight loss in the short term, which can help with certain health conditions, the risks may outweigh the benefits. If you’re on medication for diabetes, you will likely need to change your dose, because the first two stages are very low in carbohydrates. If you have renal disease, you might get more protein than your kidneys can handle. And if you have heart disease or a digestive disorder, you would be missing out on heart-healthy fiber. Talk with your doctor if you are planning to start the Dukan diet. Who shouldn’t try the Dukan diet? If you have chronic conditions such as gout, kidney disease, or liver disease, Zelman recommends steering clear of the Dukan diet, as the diet doesn't follow the recommended dietary guidelines for those conditions. Older adults at risk for muscle loss should talk with their doctor before they start the Dukan diet, which can be a side effect of rapid weight loss. If you often experience digestive issues or constipation, the Dukan diet may not be the right fit for you, as it provides limited sources of fiber. Zelman notes that gut health is important for your whole body, including your brain health, but you probably won't get enough fiber from solely oat bran. \"Oat bran isn't particularly high in fiber,\" says Zelman. \"The Dukan diet recommends 1.5 tablespoons daily, which has 2 grams of fiber, but most people need closer to 28 grams daily.\" Cutting out foods such as fruits, vegetables, and beans can negatively affect your gut health and may make your stomach problems worse. Because of the restrictive nature of this plan, it's important to check with your doctor first if you have a health condition. Zelman cautions that children should never be put on the Dukan diet, as the restrictiveness of the diet can lead to nutritional gaps that can affect their growth and development. And remember: animal protein is expensive. The grocery bill for this diet may put it out of reach if you're on a budget. Unlike other high-protein diets, this plan focuses on lean protein sources over those high in saturated fat. And protein can make you feel fuller longer, helping you lose weight. The downside is that this plan often isn't sustainable. Even more problematic, it recommends that you stay in the consolidation phase until you reach your goal. If you have a lot of weight to lose, this phase could go on for months or even years, which could lead to a nutritionally inadequate diet -- if you're able to sustain the diet at all. Even if you lose a lot of weight on the Dukan diet, the pounds often come back because the restrictive nature of the plan makes it hard to maintain. If you’re looking to lose a relatively small amount of weight fast, then this diet may work for you. If you are over 50, have a health condition such as diabetes, or need to lose a lot of weight, talk to your doctor before you try out the diet. While one small study suggests the benefits of this diet, Zelman doesn't recommend it. Instead, she suggests others that have wider support from the medical community: \"The Mediterranean diet is a strong, evidence-based plan that we've seen -- over and over again -- has mountains of studies on it.\"\n\nThat's hard to know because there hasn't been much research on the diet. The early phases are so restrictive that they could lead to nutrient deficiencies. And the excess protein could increase the risk for kidney damage, heart disease, and osteoporosis. How fast can I lose weight on the Dukan diet? In one study, women lost an average of 33 pounds after 8-10 weeks on this diet. How many eggs can you eat on the Dukan diet? There's no limit to how much you can eat, and eggs are included in every phase of the diet. You can eat chicken, quail, or duck eggs. Does the Dukan diet put you in ketosis? In the early phases, the diet puts your body into ketosis. That means you burn fat for energy instead of carbohydrates.Dieta Dukan: cómo hacerla para adelgazar sin poner en riesgo la salud: La dieta Dukan es una de las más populares del mundo, pero también de las más polémicas. Se basa en el consumo de proteínas y la limitación de carbohidratos y grasas, con el objetivo de perder peso rápido. Sin embargo, ¿es realmente segura y efectiva? Si se hace bien, sí. Te explicamos en qué consiste la dieta Dukan, cómo se hace, qué fases tiene, qué alimentos se pueden comer y te daremos algunos consejos para hacerla de forma saludable con un menú descargable muy completo.\n\nFamosas como Jennifer López y Gisele Bündchen han confesado haber hecho la dieta Dukan, aunque, no nos engañemos, las celebrities siempre están haciendo “piruetas nutricionales”. Pero las famosas no son las más indicadas a la hora de valorar una dieta para adelgazar, y en el caso de la dieta Dukan, las posiciones son encontradas, con defensores acérrimos y detractores enconados.\n\nLa dieta Dukan es una dieta que prioriza el consumo de proteínas (carne, pescado, marisco, huevo…) por delante de otros grupos alimentarios como los carbohidratos y las grasas. A la vez, tiene fases en las que se reduce o se elimina incluso el consumo de fruta y verdura. Si estás buscando una dieta proteica saludable, aquí tienes una para seguir dos semanas y adelgazar.\n\nEn la dieta Dukan se restringen los alimentos que se pueden comer, pero no así las cantidades, que son libres. Lo que pasa es que esto es un poco tramposo, porque puedes comer hamburguesas sin límite, pero al hacerlo sin poder acompañarlas de pan, patatas fritas o incluso de verdura, ¿cuántas hamburguesas realmente te comerás?\n\nAdemás, se divide en 4 fases, cuya duración depende del peso que haya que perder. Te las presentamos una a una.\n\n¿Qué dicen los expertos sobre la dieta dukan?\n\nLa Academia Española de Nutrición y Dietética considera que la dieta Dukan es una dieta milagro de tipo hiperproteica, baja en carbohidratos y grasas. Lejos de presentar ventajas respecto de las dietas hipocalóricas equilibradas, conlleva riesgos para la salud de las personas que la siguen, tanto a corto como a largo plazo, con efectos que podrían considerarse leves y temporales, y otros que podrían ser más graves y persistentes.\n\nAsí mismo, hay expertos como la dietética Jessika Ero, autora de 'Dieta Dukan: La guía definitiva del método Dukan y la dieta proteica' que la respaldan, proponiendo un plan similar pero saludable sin poner en riesgo tu salud, como el que nosotras te proponemos más abajo y que puedes descargar gratis para seguirla fácilmente.\n\n¿Qué se puede comer en la primera fase de la dieta Dukan?\n\nSe comen solo alimentos proteicos (carne, pescado, marisco, huevo, tofu y seitán) a voluntad. Las proteínas son de origen animal, con la excepción del tofu y el seitán. Además, Dukan dice que hay que tomar 1,5 cucharadas soperas de salvado de avena al día, por ejemplo, haciéndote una tortita. De hecho, la tortita de avena de Dukan es una de sus recetas más famosas.\n\nDukan es radical en cuanto a las grasas. De hecho, entre los alimentos autorizados en esta fase no están ni el aceite de oliva ni de cualquier otro tipo. Solo vinagre, zumo de limón, hierbas aromáticas y especias. Y los lácteos autorizados son siempre desnatados o 0%. Por supuesto, no se puede freír.\n• Evita tirar de carne roja y/o procesada. Para muchas gente, Dukan es sinónimo de comer carne a discreción, pero esto lo es todo menos saludable. La carne roja es la menos recomendable, por lo que es mejor no abusar de ella en ningún caso. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) no recomienda tomarla más de una vez por semana.\n• Prioriza el consumo de pescado y huevos.Es una proteína muy completa pero más magra. Tampoco olvides moluscos y crustáceos.\n• Incluye tofu y seitán en tus menús. Para evitar dentro de lo que cabe el exceso de proteína animal, recurre a ellos.\n\nDepende del peso que debas perder, pero si son menos de 5 kilos, es de solo un día. Y si son más de 5 kilos, nuestra recomendación es que lo hagas con la supervisión de un médico o nutricionista.\n\nEjemplo de menú de la fase de proteínas puras (que es el mismo que para el día de proteína pura)\n• Desayuno: Tortita de avena Dukan + revoltillo de huevo + yogur + té, café o infusión.\n• Comida: Mejillones al vapor + merluza al horno o rosbif + queso fresco.\n\nFase 2 de la dieta Dukan: Fase de crucero\n\nSe alternan días de proteínas puras con otras de proteína + verdura (PV). Dura hasta alcanzar el peso deseado. La alternancia de cada fase depende de cada persona, del peso que deba perder, de si sufre o no estreñimiento… Dukan solía recomendar cinco de PP y otros cinco de PV, pero luego prefirió la alternancia de 1 día de PP y otro de PV, porque es más fácil de seguir.\n• Qué verduras y hortalizas se autorizan. Todas menos aguacate, guisantes, habas, patatas o maíz. La zanahoria o la remolacha están autorizadas pero sin abusar, y solo en una comida al día.\n• Cocciones. Se prioriza la plancha en sartenes antiadherentes para no usar aceite, el horno o el vapor. No recomienda freír.\n• El aceite sigue prohibido. Dukan solo recomienda el aceite de parafina, pero no sería nuestra opción. Para aliñar la verdura, solo vinagre, limón o salsa de yogur (yogur batido con mostaza o hierbas aromáticas y unas gotas de limón).\n\nHasta que hayas llegado al peso que deseas.\n\nEjemplo de menú de la fase de crucero\n• Desayuno: Torta de avena + jamón York o de pavo + una tarrina de queso fresco 0% + té, café o infusión.\n• Comida: Verduras asadas + hamburguesa de ternera + yogur desnatado.\n• Cena: Sopa de verduras + lubina al horno + yogur desnatado.\n\nFase 3 de la dieta Dukan: Fase de consolidación\n\nEn esta fase, se pueden comer alimentos que hasta ahora estaban prohibidos pero con limitaciones.\n• Se puede comer fruta, pero solo 1 pieza (menos uvas y frutos secos).\n• Se pueden comer 2 rebanadas de pan integral, la cantidad de pan que se recomienda comer al día para no engordar.\n• También se pueden comer 40 g de queso duro al día.\n• Una vez a la semana se puede tomar 1 ración de pasta, arroz o lentejas.\n• Se sigue haciendo 1 día de proteínas puras (PP). Y hay una comida libre semanal. Ojo, es una comida, no un día. En esta comida se puede comer el primero, segundo y postre que se desee, pero sin repetir. La puedes acompañar de una copa de vino.\n\nEsta fase, a su vez, tiene una segunda parte (no queda muy claro qué es distinto de la primera parte de la fase de consolidación y de la segunda), en la que se pueden comer 2 piezas de fruta en lugar de una; 2 raciones de pasta, arroz o lentejas a la semana; y 2 comidas de gala.\n\nSon 10 días de consolidación por cada kilo perdido en las dos fases anteriores. Por lo tanto, si has perdido 4 kilos, son 40 días siguiendo la tercera fase. Como te decíamos, no sabemos muy bien si 20 son de la primera parte de la fase 3 y 20 de la segunda parte de la fase 3 o la subdivisión está en función de otros factores.\n\nEjemplo de menú de la fase de consolidación\n• Desayuno: 1 rebanada de pan integral + 1 tarrina de queso fresco 0% + té, café o infusión.\n• Comida: Espárragos asados + pollo asado + 1 rebanada de pan integral + 1 fruta.\n• Cena: Crema de calabaza (sin nata) + salmón ahumado + tortita de salvado de avena + yogur desnatado.\n\nFase 4 de la dieta Dukan: Fase de estabilización\n\nDukan considera que es la vuelta a la “libertad” alimenticia, sin ninguna prohibición y se conseguirá no volver a ganar peso solo teniendo en cuenta estas 3 reglas:\n\nEsta será tu manera de comer para siempre.\n\nSi vas a hacer la dieta, ten en cuenta...\n• Cuántas comidas hacer: Dukan aconseja hacer tres comidas principales, desayuno, comida y cena. Pero autoriza a hacer uno o dos tentempiés que pueden ser yogur desnatado, huevo duro, cecina, jamón York o de pavo (100% carne, sin fécula ni otros añadidos…). Estos alimentos se pueden acompañar de té, café o infusiones.\n• Toma salvado de avena cada día: Dukan aconseja tomar 1 a 2 cucharadas al día en las primeras fases y no llegar a 3 cucharadas hasta la fase de estabilización. Además, recomienda que sea un salvado sin refinar y que no contenga el germen.\n• Qué puedes beber... Dukan \"obliga\" a tomar 1,5 litros de líquido al día y autoriza tomar agua, infusiones, tés, cafés y bebidas edulcoradas con o sin burbujas. Nosotras no estamos de acuerdo con el \"abuso\" de los edulcorantes del método, por lo que tampoco hemos incorporado postres típicos de Dukan como natillas, pasteles, etc. Solo cuando tienes derecho a comidas de gala puedes tomar una copa de vino.\n• Salero, a raya. Dukan no aconseja salar demasiado los alimentos –y como no tira de precocinados ni de ultraprocesados– su dieta es baja en sal. Prefiere que el sabor de los alimentos se realce con hierbas aromáticas o especias.\n• Tienes que hacer ejercicio cada día: En la fase de ataque, el médico francés y creador de la dieta, Pierre Dukan, recomienda andar al menos 20 minutos al día; en las siguientes, 30 minutos; y si te estancas, pasar a una hora diaria al menos durante 3 días seguidos. Por supuesto, si quieres sumar más actividades a andar, eres libre de hacerlo y Dukan te anima a ello, pero sin descuidar nunca tu caminata diaria.\n\nLa versión sana de la dieta Dukan\n\nEn CLARA pensamos que hay que aumentar el consumo de verdura y fruta y no exagerar con las proteínas (pasar de 120 g por ración a 150 g, por ejemplo), equilibrando las animales y las vegetales. Y moderar el consumo de cereales –siempre integrales– o grasas.\n\nQué comer en la versión de Clara\n• En las primeras fases: Si quieres hacer las primeras fases de Dukan, nuestro consejo es que sean cortas. No hagas más de 1-2 días la primera y no más de 1-2 semanas la segunda.\n• En la tercera fase: Puedes seguirla hasta llegar al peso deseado, haciendo o no el día de proteínas puras. Pero en lugar de 1 toma 2 piezas de fruta y consume pan, pasta, arroz o patata en las comidas principales en raciones de guarnición. Y 2 o 3 veces por semana, toma un puñado de frutos secos.\n• En la fase de mantenimiento: Siguiendo nuestros consejos para la fase tres, añade 1 o 2 comidas libres semanales.\n\nSi te apetece hacer la versión sana de CLARA de la dieta Dukan, aquí te dejamos un menú descargable para que puedas hacerlo fácilmente. Tienes los descargables en dos formatos, jpg y pdf, para que te sea más cómodo. Y, por supuesto, son completamente gratis.

This program was set up by the French health authorities in order to experiment and evaluate remote monitoring of various pathologies.\n\nThe ETAPES program encourages and financially supports the deployment of remote monitoring projects throughout France. Remote monitoring requires several categories of professionals to coordinate around the patient to perform a medical act, provide a technical solution or ensure therapeutic support. The organization of these practices requires time for appropriation and deployment, which justifies the use of experiments. At present, the experiments concern five pathologies: heart failure, renal failure, respiratory failure, diabetes, and implantable cardiac prostheses. Each type of experimentation is based on national specifications.\n\nComuniCare has been approved for 3 pathologies: heart failure, respiratory failure and diabetes. This certification is an important step in the strategy to gain access to reimbursement for our therapeutic support solutions for patients in Europe."}

Elles opposent, pendant trois décennies, l'Empire romain, dirigé par Constantin , aux peuples germaniques situés aux confins septentrionaux de l'Empire : les Francs, les Alamans et les Goths, et les Iazyges, branche occidentale des Sarmates. Ces campagnes, qui ont pour théâtre opérationnel le limes, ont pour but de protéger les frontières de l'empire, de 306 à 336\n\nUne fois arrivé à la tête des provinces à l'Ouest du limes du Rhin (en 306), à la suite de la mort de son père Constance Chlore, Constantin concentre ses premiers efforts dans la lutte pour défendre cette partie de la frontière contre les tribus germaniques des Francs et les Alémans, faisant d'Augusta Treverorum (Trèves) sa première capitale. Avec la victoire sur l'usurpateur Maxence (bataille du pont Milvius, à Rome, en 312)[1] toute l'Italie passe aussi sous son contrôle, faisant de Constantin l'unique auguste en Occident.\n\nEn , Constantin (qui a passé l'hiver à Rome), établit une alliance avec Licinius, renforcée par le mariage de ce dernier avec Flavia Julia Constantia, sœur de Constantin[2]. Mais cette alliance ne dure que quelques années, puisque dès 316 les deux Augustes sont en conflit. Constantin prend le dessus sur Licinius, contraint de céder l'Illyrie[3] mais conservant la Thrace[3]. Constantin progresse avec des acquisitions territoriales toujours plus à l'est, se retrouvant alors à devoir défendre l'important limes sarmaticus (à partir de 317).\n\nDurant les années suivantes Constantin concentre ses efforts le long du limes danubiano, combattant surtout les Sarmates aux confins de la Pannonie[4], séjournant à Sirmium presque sans interruption jusqu'en 324 (année où son armée marche à nouveau contre Licinio), en faisant sa capitale aux côtés de Sardica[5]. Au cours de ces années, Constantin fait encore preuve d'une grande activité militaire, parcourant entièrement les frontières des territoires récemment acquis. En 320 il nomme son fils aîné, Crispus, déjà préfet du prétoire, à la tête des troupes en Gaule.\n\nEn apprenant qu'une armée de Goths[6] a traversé le Danube pour dévaster le territoire romain de Mésie et la Thrace, appartenant à son rival Licinius[7], il quitte son quartier général de Thessalonique[8] et s'apprête à marcher contre eux (en 323). Le fait de franchir la frontière de fait, attaquant ses ennemis dans une partie de l'Empire romain qui n'était pas sous sa juridiction, déclenche la dernière phase de la guerre de la tétrarchie entre les deux Augustes, qui se solde par la défaite finale de Licinius et la consécration de Constantin comme unique empereur[9].\n\nDurant la phase ultime de son règne, jusqu'à sa mort (survenue en 337), l'empereur chrétien consolide les limes, le long du Rhin et du Danube et obtient d'importants succès militaires qui le mènent à contrôler d'importantes parties des territoires anciennement romains abandonnés sous Gallien et Aurélien : de l'Alémanie à la Sarmatie et à la Gothie. Constantin continue à utiliser ses résidences de Serdica, Sirmium et Tessalonica, plutôt que la capitale de Dioclétien, Nicomedia.\n\nEn novembre 284, avec la mort de l'empereur Numérien à qui son père Carus avait confié l'empire oriental, et le refus des troupes d'Orient de reconnaître Carin, le fils aîné de Carus, comme successeur naturel, Dioclétien, général d'origine illyrienne, est élevé à la dignité impériale. À la fin de la guerre civile qui en découle, Dioclétien, victorieux, nomme en novembre 285 comme son second (Caesar) un officier du nom de Maximien Hercule, qui sera élevé quelques mois plus tard au titre d'Auguste, formant ainsi une dyarchie dans laquelle l'Empire romain est géographiquement divisé. Cela implique une division de la responsabilité de la défense des frontières contre la pression croissante des invasions extérieures, notamment germaniques, sardes, et perses, ainsi que contre les tentatives récurrentes d'usurpation de la dignité impériale[10],[11].\n\nDevant la difficulté croissante à contenir les nombreuses révoltes internes et la pression aux frontières, une nouvelle division territoriale est effectué en 293 afin de faciliter les opérations militaires : Dioclétien nomme Galère comme son César pour l'Orient, pendant que Maximien Hercule fait de même avec Constance Chlore pour l'Occident[12].\n\nCe système tétrarchique entre cependant en crise après l'abdication des deux Augustes (305), Dioclétien et Maximien Hercule, provoquant une nouvelle guerre civile (306-324), provoquant de nouvelles percées des barbares dans le système défensif de l'Empire, avec des tentatives d'installations de populations barbares à l'intérieur des frontières.\n\nCe n'est qu'avec l'accession au trône de Constantin, devenu l'unique Auguste en Occident après la bataille du pont Milvius en 312, et, à plus forte raison, la défaite de Licinius et la réunification subséquente de l'empire sous l'autorité d'un empereur unique (en 324), que les frontières septentrionale, rhénane et danubienne furent à nouveau défendues de manière adéquate. Ainsi, on attribue à cet empereur non seulement le mérite d'avoir perfectionné la hiérarchie militaire dioclétienne, mais aussi d'avoir reconquis, ou du moins placé dans un rapport de vassalité, plusieurs peuples barbares dans tous les territoires ayant appartenu à l'empire sous Trajan (Champs Décumates, une partie de la Dacie)[13].\n\nAvec la mort de Constance Chlore, survenue à Eburacum (York) le [14],[15], le système de tétrarchie est en crise : le fils illégitime de l'empereur défunt, Constantin, est proclamé Auguste[16] par le général Crocus et l'armée de Bretagne[17],[18],[19],[20]. Cette élection relève d'un principe dynastique, à l'opposé de la méritocratie voulue par Dioclétien. Lactance défend une version différente des faits, affirmant que Constantin est nommé Auguste par son père sur son lit de mort[21]. Cependant, Galère, déçu par ce choix, propose à Constantin le titre de Caesar, ce que l'intéressé accepte, laissant à Sévère la dignité d'Auguste[22]. Quelques mois plus tard, Maxence, fils du vieillissant Auguste Maximien Hercules, est acclamé empereur par la Garde prétorienne, reprenant le principe dynastique, grâce au soutien d'officiels comme Marcellianus, Marcenus et Lucianus (mais non d'Abellio, vicaire de la préfecture de la Ville, qui sera alors mis à mort)[23]. C'est durant cette période que Constantin commence à remporter des succès militaires importants contre les Alamans et les Francs, le long des frontières qui lui sont confiées, succès rapportés par Eutrope[24].\n\nD'agissant des forces romaines disponibles pour Constantin, c'est-à-dire celle stationnées le long des limes septentrionaux, de la Bretagne à la Mésie, il est utile de rappeler que cette époque est celle d'une importante réforme de l'armée romaine, avec un nouveau déploiement des légions le long des frontières voulu par Dioclétien, et d'une augmentation de la taille globale de l'armée. On sait qu'avec la réforme, le nombre total de légions fut porté à 55 ou 56[25]. Après l'accession au trône de Constantin et la reprise de la monarchie dynastique, le nombre total de légion fut porté à 62 ou 64, vers l'an 330[26].\n\nLe long des lignes rhénanes, face à la Gaule et à la Bretagne, s'exerce principalement la pression des Francs et des Saxons. Les Alamans procèdent aussi à quelques incursions dans ces régions, mais leur objectif principal est, dans cette période, l'Italie septentrionale, à travers la Pannonie (frontière du haut Danube). Les offensives majeures visèrent cependant la zone du bas Danube, dans les provinces romaines des Balkans, où se concentrèrent les attaques des Marcomans, des Quades, des Sarmates et surtout des Goths (Tervinges et Greuthunges).\n\nDans cette nouvelle phase, Constantin , maintenant souverain unique (Restitutor orbis[100]) et absolu de l'Empire (Dominus et Deus), réussit non seulement à consolider la totalité du système défensif le long des frontières rhénane et danubienne, mais obtient d'importants succès militaires et reprend le contrôle d'anciens territoires romains abandonnés sous Galien et Aurélien : il s'agit de l'Alémanie (champs Décumates), de la Sarmatie (plaine de la Tisza, le Banat historique) et de la Gothie (une partie de la Roumanie actuelle), comme semblent le démontrer les monnaies de cette période et un nouveau système défensif de cette époque (les « digues du diables », et le « mur de Constantin » ou Brazda lui Novac)[101],[102],[103],[98].\n\nIl faut ajouter que pendant la période en question, Constantin porte une nouvelle série de réformes, complétant celles entreprises quarante ans plus tôt par Dioclétien[105]. Ce processus s'étendra sur les treize dernières années de son règne (jusqu'à sa mort en 337).\n\nL'équilibre des forces sur le bas cours du Danube, après les campagnes répétées de Constantin et de ses fils, reste pratiquement inchangé jusque vers 375. En Orient, on assiste à toute une série de préparatifs en vue de la campagne imminente contre les Sassanides, jamais menée à bien en raison de la disparition de l'empereur en 337. C'est au contraire l'empereur perse Shapur II qui passe à la contre-offensive. Pendant un quart de siècle, les armées romaines, d'abord sous le règne du fils de Constantin Constance II, puis de son neveu Julien, combattent les armées perses avec des succès variables de 337 à 363. Les frontières romaines orientales et du bas-Danube restent pratiquement inchangées pendant une trentaine d'années.

I watched the first episode and it was great as hell! Harley Quinn is such a fantastic villain to be a fantastic protagonist in the series, the violence, the animation, the writing, and the humor is very amazing! And I can easily say that this show is so great to watch. Now it became one of my favorite animated DC shows since Teen Titans, Young Justice, and DC Super Hero Girls (2019). I give Harley Quinn a 9.5/10Anthony Quinn - Wikipedia: Manuel Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca (April 21, 1915 – June 3, 2001), known as Anthony Quinn, was an American actor. He was known for his portrayal of earthy, passionate characters \"marked by a brutal and elemental virility\"[1] in over 100 film, television and stage roles between 1936 and 2002. He was a two-time Academy Award winner, and was also nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards and a Tony Award.\n\nQuinn was born in Chihuahua City, Mexico, and was raised in El Paso, Texas and East Los Angeles.[2] After stints as a boxer and an architect,[3] he made his film debut in the Cecil B. DeMille Western The Plainsman in 1936. Initially typecast as a “heavy” and playing other minor parts as well, he was gradually cast in more substantial parts, including co-starring roles in Blood and Sand (1941) and The Ox-Bow Incident (1943). He won his first Oscar, for Best Supporting Actor, for his portrayal of Eufemio Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952), becoming the first Mexican-born performer to win an Academy Award. He received his second Oscar in 1957 for Lust for Life.\n\nHe would be nominated for Best Actor twice more, for his roles in Wild is the Wind (1958) and Zorba the Greek (1964).[4][5] His other notable films included La Strada (1954), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Guns for San Sebastian (1968), The Shoes of the Fisherman (1968), Across 110th Street (1972), The Message (1976), Lion of the Desert (1980), Jungle Fever (1991) and Seven Servants (1996).[4][5] He also starred in the Broadway plays A Streetcar Named Desire (replacing Marlon Brando), Becket (earning a Tony nomination for Best Actor in a Play), and Zorba (reprising his film role).\n\nAside from his acting career, Quinn was also a civil rights activist, an avid painter, and the author of several autobiographical books. In 1987, he was presented with the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. Through both his artistic endeavors and activism, he is considered a seminal figure of Latin-American representation in the media of the United States.[5][6]\n\nManuel Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca was born April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico, during the Mexican Revolution to Manuela \"Nellie\" (née Oaxaca)[7] and Francisco \"Frank\" Quinn.[4][2] Frank Quinn was born to an Irish immigrant father from County Cork and a Mexican mother.[8] Frank reportedly rode with Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, then later moved to the East Los Angeles neighborhood of City Terrace and became an assistant cameraman at a movie studio.[4] In Quinn's autobiography, The Original Sin: A Self-portrait by Anthony Quinn, he denied being the son of an \"Irish adventurer\" and attributed that tale to Hollywood publicists.[9] Quinn later said he was not accepted in Mexico because of his surname.[9]\n\nWhen he was six years old, Quinn attended a Catholic church and even contemplated becoming a priest, but at the age of 11, he joined the Pentecostals at the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, which was founded and led by the evangelical preacher Aimee Semple McPherson.[10] For a time, Quinn played in the church's band and was an apprentice preacher with the evangelist. \"I have known most of the great actresses of my time, and not one of them could touch her,\" Quinn once said of the spellbinding McPherson, whom he credited with inspiring Zorba's gesture of the dramatically outstretched hand.[11]\n\nQuinn grew up first in El Paso, Texas, and later in East Los Angeles and in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, California. He attended Hammel Street Elementary School, Belvedere Junior High School, Polytechnic High School, and Belmont High School in Los Angeles, with future baseball player and General Hospital star John Beradino, but left before graduating. In June 1987, Tucson High School in Arizona awarded him an honorary high-school diploma.[12]\n\nAs a young man, Quinn boxed professionally to earn money, then studied art and architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright at the designer's Arizona residence and his Wisconsin studio, Taliesin. The two men became friends. When Quinn mentioned that he was drawn to acting, Wright encouraged him. Quinn said he had been offered $800 per week by a film studio and did not know what to do. Wright replied, \"Take it, you'll never make that much with me.\"[3][This quote needs a citation] During a 1999 interview on Private Screenings with Robert Osborne, Quinn said the contract was for only $300 per week.[13]\n\nAfter a short time performing on the stage, Quinn launched his film career performing character roles in the 1936 films The Plainsman (as a Cheyenne Indian after Custer's defeat with Gary Cooper), Parole (in which he made his debut), and The Milky Way, his first motion picture, although he was not credited. He played \"ethnic\" villains in Paramount films such as Dangerous to Know (1938) with Anna May Wong and Road to Morocco with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and played a more sympathetic Crazy Horse in They Died with Their Boots On with Errol Flynn.[14]\n\nA breakthrough in his career occurred in 1941, when he received an offer to play a matador in the bullfighting-themed Blood and Sand with Tyrone Power and Rita Hayworth. In 1942, Quinn co-starred alongside Power in another critical and financial success, the swashbuckling adventure The Black Swan. In 1943, he had a role in the Oscar-nominated Western The Ox-Bow Incident. He co-starred in Sinbad the Sailor (1947) with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Maureen O'Hara.\n\nBy 1947, Quinn had appeared in more than 50 films and had played a variety of characters, including Indians, Mafia dons, Hawaiian chiefs, Filipino freedom fighters, Chinese guerrillas, and Arab sheiks. He returned to the theater, replacing Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway. In 1947, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[15]\n\nHe returned to Hollywood in the early 1950s, and was cast in a series of B-adventures such as Mask of the Avenger (1951). He solidified his position as one of Hollywood's premier actors in Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata! (1952), opposite Marlon Brando. Quinn's performance as Zapata's brother won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor while Brando lost the Oscar for Best Actor to Gary Cooper in High Noon.[14] Quinn holds the distinction of being the first Mexican-American to win an Academy Award.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Quinn traveled to Rome, where he collaborated with several renowned Italian filmmakers and established himself as a star of world cinema. He worked with Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti in the Kirk Douglas film Ulysses, and starred as Attila the Hun, with Sophia Loren, in Attila. In 1953, he turned in one of his best performances as a dim-witted, thuggish, and volatile strongman in Federico Fellini's Oscar-winning La Strada (1954), opposite Giulietta Masina.\n\nQuinn won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of painter Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli's Lust for Life (1956), alongside Kirk Douglas, who portrayed Vincent van Gogh. Quinn also starred as Quasimodo in the French-language film The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Even after his return to the United States, Quinn continued to appear periodically in European films. His frequent portrayal of Italian characters and appearance in Italian films led to the popular misconception that he was, in fact, Italian.\n\nThe following year, he received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his part in George Cukor's Wild Is the Wind. Quinn starred in the film The Savage Innocents (1959) as Inuk, an Eskimo who finds himself caught between two clashing cultures.[14] He teamed with Kirk Douglas once again in the Western Last Train from Gun Hill (1959).\n\nHe appeared on Broadway to great acclaim in Becket, as King Henry II to Laurence Olivier's Thomas Becket in 1960. Quinn's performance earned him a Tony Award nomination for best leading actor and Becket received the award for best play. An erroneous story arose in later years that during the run, Quinn and Olivier switched roles and Quinn played Becket to Olivier's King. In fact, Quinn left the production for a film, never having played Becket, and director Peter Glenville suggested a road tour with Olivier as Henry. Olivier happily agreed and Arthur Kennedy took on the role of Becket for the tour and brief return to Broadway.[16][17]\n\nAs the decade ended, Quinn allowed his age to show and began his transformation into a major character actor. His physique filled out, his hair grayed, and his once smooth, swarthy face weathered and became more rugged. He played a Greek resistance fighter in The Guns of Navarone (1961), an aging boxer in Requiem for a Heavyweight, and the Bedouin shaikh Auda abu Tayi in Lawrence of Arabia (both 1962). Lawrence of Arabia would go on to win the Oscar and Golden Globe for best picture, and Quinn received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor alongside co-star Peter O'Toole. He also played the title role in the 1961 film Barabbas, based on a novel by Pär Lagerkvist.[14] In 1962, he returned to Broadway, playing the role of Caesario Grimaldi in the Tony Award-nominated Tchin-Tchin, and had the lead role in the film Requiem for a Heavyweight.\n\nThe success of Zorba the Greek in 1964 resulted in another Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Other films included The 25th Hour, The Magus, Guns for San Sebastian, and The Shoes of the Fisherman.[14] In 1969, he starred in The Secret of Santa Vittoria with Anna Magnani; each was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.[18]\n\nIn 1970 Quinn starred as a liberal sociology professor in the campus unrest drama R. P. M., opposite Ann-Margret, and as a Smoky Mountains backwoodsman in A Walk in the Spring Rain, Ingrid Bergman's first American film in 20 years. In 1971, after the success of a TV movie named The City, where Quinn played Mayor Thomas Jefferson Alcala, he starred in the television series, The Man and the City. Quinn's subsequent television appearances were sporadic, including Jesus of Nazareth.[14]\n\nIn 1972, he co-starred with Yaphet Kotto in the blaxploitation film Across 110th Street. He played NYPD Captain Frank Martelli, who along with Kotto, was investigating a robbery-homicide of Italian and Black gangsters in Harlem, New York City. He played the old racist, violent captain, against Kotto's modern, educated, enlightened lieutenant.\n\nIn 1976, Quinn starred in the movie Mohammad, Messenger of God (also known as The Message), about the origin of Islam, as Hamza, a highly respected uncle of Mohammad, the prophet of Islam.[14] In 1981, he starred in Lion of the Desert. Quinn played real-life Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar, who fought Benito Mussolini's Italian troops in the deserts of Libya.[14]\n\nIn 1979, Quinn starred in the film The Passage, as a Basque shepherd during WWII. He was tasked with leading a scientist and his family across the Pyrenees, while pursued by Nazis. It also starred James Mason and Malcolm McDowell.\n\nIn 1983, he reprised his role as Zorba for 362 performances in a successful musical version, called Zorba, opposite fellow film co-star Lila Kedrova, reprising her role as Madame Hortense. Quinn performed in the musical both on Broadway and at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.[19]\n\nIn 1990, he starred in The Old Man and the Sea, a television movie based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway. Quinn's film career slowed during the 1990s, but he nonetheless continued to work steadily, appearing in Revenge (1990), Jungle Fever (1991), Only the Lonely (1991), Last Action Hero (1993), A Walk in the Clouds (1995) and Seven Servants (1996).[14]\n\nIn 1994, Quinn played the role of Zeus in five television movies focusing on the legendary journeys of Hercules. These were, in order, Hercules and the Amazon Women, Hercules and the Lost Kingdom, Hercules and the Circle of Fire, Hercules in the Underworld, and Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur.[14]\n\nIn 1995, Quinn starred in his last movie in a lead role in the film Seven Servants, by Daryush Shokof.\n\nQuinn's first wife was actress Katherine DeMille, the adopted daughter of Cecil B. DeMille; they wed in 1937. The couple had five children: Christopher (1938–1941), Christina (born December 1, 1941), Catalina (born November 21, 1942), Duncan (born August 4, 1945), and Valentina (born December 26, 1952).[20] Their first child, Christopher, aged two, drowned in the lily pond of next-door neighbor W. C. Fields.[20] During his marriage to DeMille, Quinn had an affair with the married actress Evelyn Keyes.[21]\n\nIn 1965, Quinn and DeMille divorced because of his affair with Italian costume designer Jolanda Addolori (died 2016), whom he married in 1966. They had three children: Francesco Quinn (March 22, 1963 – August 5, 2011), Danny Quinn (born April 16, 1964), and Lorenzo Quinn (born May 7, 1966).[5]\n\nIn the 1970s, during his marriage to Addolori, Quinn also had two children with Friedel Dunbar, an event producer in Los Angeles: Sean Quinn (born February 7, 1973) and Alexander Anthony Quinn (born December 30, 1976).\n\nIn the 1990s, Quinn had two children with his secretary Katherine Benvin; daughter Antonia Patricia Rose Quinn (born July 23, 1993) and son Ryan Nicholas Quinn (born July 5, 1996).[22] His marriage with Addolori finally ended in divorce in August 1997. He then married Benvin in December 1997 and remained married to her until his death.\n\nQuinn, who experienced discrimination growing up in Los Angeles, participated in various civil-rights and social causes. He provided funding for Latino advocacy group the Spanish-Speaking People's Congress.[23] He assisted in fundraising efforts for the legal defense of Mexican-American youth in the racially charged Sleepy Lagoon murder trial in 1942.[citation needed] While in Paris, several other prominent Americans and he composed a petition endorsing the 1963 March on Washington; the petition, which was reprinted in several high-profile publications, was intended to rally support among Americans living abroad, according to Elliott Miller, writing in CounterPunch.[24][better source needed] In 1969, Quinn visited with Native American student activists occupying Alcatraz Island in protest, promising to offer assistance.[25] In 1970, Quinn was a panelist at the Mexican-American Conference.[26] In 1971, he narrated a documentary film by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, discussing job discrimination faced by Hispanic Americans.[27] He was a supporter of the United Farm Workers organization led by his friend and labor activist Cesar Chavez.[28]\n\nArt critic Donald Kuspit explains, \"Examining Quinn's many expressions of creativity together—his art, collecting, and acting—we can see that he was a creative genius.\"[29]\n\nEarly in life, Quinn had an interest in painting and drawing. Throughout his teenaged years, he won various art competitions in California and focused his studies at Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles on drafting. Later, Quinn studied briefly under Frank Lloyd Wright through the Taliesin Fellowship — an opportunity created by winning first prize in an architectural design contest. Through Wright's recommendation, Quinn took acting lessons as a form of postoperative speech therapy, which led to an acting career that spanned over six decades.\n\nApart from art classes taken in Chicago during the 1950s, Quinn never attended art school; nonetheless, taking advantage of books, museums, and amassing a sizable collection, he managed to give himself an effective education in the language of modern art. By the early 1980s, his work had caught the eyes of various gallery owners and was exhibited internationally, in Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York City, and Paris. His work is now represented in both public and private collections throughout the world.[31]\n\nHe wrote two memoirs, The Original Sin (1972) and One Man Tango (1997), a number of scripts, and a series of unpublished stories currently in the collection of his archive.\n\nQuinn spent his last years in Bristol, Rhode Island. He died of respiratory failure (due to complications from radiation treatment for lung cancer) on June 3, 2001, in Boston, at age 86.[4] Quinn's funeral was held in the First Baptist Church in America in College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island.[32] His wife asked for the permission of Bristol authorities to bury him in his favorite spot in the backyard of his house, near an old maple tree. They had bought the property in 1995; it had a view of the Narragansett Bay.[33] Permission was granted and he was laid to rest there.[33]\n\nOn January 5, 1982, the Belvedere County Public Library in East Los Angeles was renamed in honor of Anthony Quinn.

He was the older brother of the second president of Iraq, Abdul Salam Arif, whom he succeeded after his brother died in an airplane crash in 1966.\n\nAbdul Rahman Arif was a career soldier in the Iraqi Army. He supported the military coup in 1958 that overthrew the monarchy, and also supported the coup that brought his brother, Abdul Salam, to power in 1963. His brother appointed him head of the army following the coup, and when the younger Arif died in an aircraft crash in April 1966, Prime Minister Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz (\"a Western-oriented lawyer\" and the first civilian to head an Iraqi government since the 1958 revolution[1]) became acting president. Three days later, al-Bazzaz was chosen to become president, but al-Bazzaz immediately relinquished the presidency to Abdul Rahman Arif. It is speculated that the transfer of power possibly occurred because the Iraqi military thought that Abdul Salam should be succeeded by his weak and easier to manipulate brother instead. Arif was appointed president by the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council. He continued his brother's policies, but with a more nationalistic profile.[citation needed]\n\nLike his brother Abdul Salam, he was an overt supporter of Egypt's pan-Arabist president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Arif Abdul Razzak, another pro-Nasser Air Force Commander, attempted a coup d'état on Arif, d lightly bombed the Presidential Palace with Soviet MiG-17 jets, but the coup failed and he was arrested. It was his second failed coup attempt on the Arif government. President Arif went on TV to declare that on this occasion, Abdul Razzak would definitely be punished, only to then release him with a pardon.\n\nHis presidency was widely believed to be slack and indecisive. However, there are historical clues that he was not corrupt. The ill-advised law that he passed to absolve himself from paying income tax was probably an indication that he was not capable of getting wealth otherwise. Shortly after Arif came to power, the Iraqi military launched a major offensive against Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani in the First Iraqi–Kurdish War, pitting 40,000 Iraqi troops against Barzani's 3,500-strong Peshmerga. Iranian and Israeli support contributed to a decisive Kurdish victory at the Battle of Mount Handren on 11 May 1966, where a battle plan devised by IDF military officer Zuri Sagy resulted in the killing of 1,400-2,000 Iraqi troops and the capture of hundreds more. Regime hard-liners were discredited by the debacle, and on 29 June 1966, Bazzaz announced a Twelve Point Plan for peace, which included \"administrative decentralisation\" in Iraqi Kurdistan and \"Kurdish representation in Parliament\".\n\nThroughout July 1966, Bazzaz began implementing the agreement by \"approving a massive rehabilitation program, lifting the economic blockade, releasing hundreds of Kurdish prisoners, removing Arab tribes from former Kurdish lands, and passing a general amnesty law\", but opposition within the military forced Arif to dismiss Bazzaz in favour of General Naji Talib on 6 August 1966.[2] Regardless, American officials in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration welcomed Iraq's brief return to civilian rule under Bazzaz as well as Arif's thwarting of Razzak's second coup attempt on 30 June.[3] Arif was considered \"one of the few forces of moderation\" in Iraq, having previously established a friendship with U.S. ambassador Robert Strong and making a number of friendly gestures to the United States between April 1966 and January 1967.[4]\n\nAt Arif's request, President Johnson met five Iraqi generals and Iraqi ambassador Nasir Hani in Washington, D.C., on 25 January 1967, reiterating his \"desire to build an ever closer relationship between [the] two governments.\"[5] According to Johnson's National Security Adviser, Walt Rostow, the U.S. National Security Council even contemplated welcoming Arif on a state visit to Washington, although this proposal was ultimately rejected due to concerns about the stability of Arif's government.[6]\n\nPrior to the outbreak of the Six-Day War, Iraqi foreign minister Adnan Pachachi met with a number of U.S. officials to discuss the escalating Middle East crisis on 1 June, including U the S. ambassador to the UN Arthur Goldberg, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene V. Rostow, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, and President Johnson himself.[7] The political atmosphere engendered by the costly Arab defeat prompted Iraq to break relations with the U.S. on 7 June, and ultimately ensured the collapse of Arif's relatively moderate government.[8]\n\nOn 17 July 1968, while Arif was sleeping, his own assistants along with members of the Ba'ath Party, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, overthrew him in a bloodless coup. As Arif and his brother had done in the 1963 coup against Qasim, the coalition declared victory once they had captured the radio station and the Ministry of Defence. It was accomplished when the defence minister, Hardan Al-Tikriti, phoned Arif informing him that he was no longer president. Arif was exiled to Turkey.\n\nArif returned to Iraq in 1979 when Saddam Hussein came to power, and largely stayed out of the public and political spotlight afterwards. He was allowed to leave the country once to undertake the Hajj. Arif left Iraq permanently after Hussein was removed from power by the U.S.-led invasion, and lived in Amman, Jordan from 2004. He died in Amman on 24 August 2007,[9] He was married to Faika Abdul-Mageed Faris Alanee.\n• \"The existence of Israel is an error which we must put right. This is our opportunity to wipe out the disgrace which is Israel which has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear – to wipe Israel off the map\", speaking on the Radio, 1 June 1967 10\n• \"I hope there will be stability and security in all parts of Iraq and neighbouring Arab countries\", he said. \"I hope there will be national unity in Iraq by forgetting the past and looking for the future.\" 11Abdul Rahman Arif: President of Iraq from 1966 to 1968Historical Documents - Office of the Historian: Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964–1968, Volume XXI, Near East Region; Arabian PeninsulaIraq - Wikipedia: Iraq,[a] officially the Republic of Iraq,[b] is a country in West Asia. It is bordered by Turkey to the north, Saudi Arabia to the south, Iran to the east, Syria to the west, the Persian Gulf and Kuwait to the southeast, and Jordan to the southwest. With a population exceeding 45 million, it is the 35th-most populous country, with the largest city being Baghdad, its capital, and consists of 18 governorates. Iraqi people are diverse; mostly Arabs, as well as Kurds, Turkmen, Yazidis, Assyrians, Armenians, Mandaeans, Persians and Shabakis with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. Most Iraqis are Muslims – minority faiths include Christianity, Yazidism, Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, Yarsanism and Judaism.[12][3][13] The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish; others also recognized in specific regions are Assyrian, Turkish, and Armenian.[14]\n\nStarting as early as the 6th millennium BC, the fertile alluvial plains between Iraq's Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, referred to as the region of Mesopotamia, gave rise to some of the world's earliest cities, civilizations, and empires. It was known as a \"Cradle of Civilisation\" that saw the inventions of a writing system, mathematics, timekeeping, a calendar, astrology, and a law code. Following the Muslim conquest, Baghdad became the capital and the largest city of the Abbasid Caliphate. During the time of the Islamic Golden Age, the city evolved into a significant cultural and intellectual center, and garnered a worldwide reputation for its academic institutions, including the House of Wisdom.[15] It was largely destroyed at the hands of the Mongol Empire in 1258 during the siege of Baghdad, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires.[16][17][18][19]\n\nSince its independence, Iraq has experienced spells of significant economic and military growth alongside periods of instability and conflict. It was a part of the Ottoman Empire until the end of World War I, after which Mandatory Iraq was established by the British Empire in 1921, followed by independent Kingdom of Iraq in 1932. Following a coup d'état in 1958, it became a republic, led by Abdul Karim Qasim followed by Abdul Salam Arif and then Abdul Rahman Arif. The Ba'ath Party came to power in 1968 and ruled as one-party state, under the leadership of Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and then by Saddam Hussein, who started major wars against Iran and Kuwait. In 2003, the Iraq War started after the United States-led coalition invaded Iraq and overthrew the Ba'ath Party. The war subsequently turned into an insurgency and sectarian civil war, with American troops withdrawing in 2011. Between 2013 and 2017, Iraq was once more in a state of war, with the rise and subsequent fall of Islamic State. Today post-war conflict in Iraq continues at a lower scale, which has been an obstacle to the country's stability alongside the rising influence of Iran.[20][21]\n\nA federal parliamentary republic country, Iraq is considered an emerging middle power. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the OPEC as well as of the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Non-Aligned Movement, and the International Monetary Fund. With a strategic location, the country has one of the largest oil reserves in the world and is among global centers for oil and gas industry. In addition, the country has been popular for its agriculture and tourism. Since its independence, it has experienced spells of significant economic and military growth alongside periods of instability and conflict. The country is putting efforts to rebuild after the war with foreign support.[22][23][24][25][26]\n\nThere are several suggested origins for the name. One dates to the Sumerian city of Uruk and is thus ultimately of Sumerian origin.[27][28] Another possible etymology for the name is from the Middle Persian word erāq, meaning \"lowlands.\"[29] An Arabic folk etymology for the name is \"deeply rooted, well-watered; fertile\".[30]\n\nDuring the medieval period, there was a region called ʿIrāq ʿArabī (\"Arabian Iraq\") for Lower Mesopotamia and ʿIrāq ʿAjamī (\"Persian Iraq\"), for the region now situated in Central and Western Iran. The term historically included the plain south of the Hamrin Mountains and did not include the northernmost and westernmost parts of the modern territory of Iraq.[32] Prior to the middle of the 19th century, the term Eyraca Arabica was commonly used to describe Iraq.[33][34]\n\nThe term Sawad was also used in early Islamic times for the region of the alluvial plain of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.\n\nAs an Arabic word, عراق ʿirāq means \"hem\", \"shore\", \"bank\", or \"edge\", so that the name by folk etymology came to be interpreted as \"the escarpment\", such as at the south and east of the Jazira Plateau, which forms the northern and western edge of the \"al-Iraq arabi\" area.[35]\n\nThe Arabic pronunciation is [ʕiˈrɑːq]. In English, it is either (the only pronunciation listed in the Oxford English Dictionary and the first one in Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary[36]) or (listed first by MQD, the American Heritage Dictionary,[37] and the Random House Dictionary.[38])\n\nWhen the British established the Hashemite king on 23 August 1921, Faisal I of Iraq, the official English name of the country changed from Mesopotamia to the endonymic Iraq.[39] Since January 1992, the official name of the state is \"Republic of Iraq\" (Jumhūriyyat al-ʿIrāq), reaffirmed in the 2005 Constitution.[40][41][42]\n\nIraq largely coincides with the ancient region of Mesopotamia, often referred to as the cradle of civilization.[43] The history of Mesopotamia extends back to the Lower Paleolithic period, with significant developments continuing through the establishment of the Caliphate in the late 7th century AD, after which the region became known as Iraq.\n\nWithin its borders lies the ancient land of Sumer, which emerged between 6000 and 5000 BC during the Neolithic Ubaid period.[43] Sumer is recognized as the world's earliest civilization, marking the beginning of urban development, written language, and monumental architecture.[43] Iraq's territory also includes the heartlands of the Akkadian, Neo-Sumerian, Babylonian, Neo-Assyrian, and Neo-Babylonian empires, which dominated Mesopotamia and much of the Ancient Near East during the Bronze and Iron Ages.[43]\n\nIraq was a center of innovation in antiquity, producing early written languages, literary works, and significant advancements in astronomy, mathematics, law, and philosophy. This era of indigenous rule ended in 539 BC when the Neo-Babylonian Empire was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great, who declared himself the \"King of Babylon.\" The city of Babylon, the ancient seat of Babylonian power, became one of the key capitals of the Achaemenid Empire. Ancient Iraq, known as the Mesopotamia, is home to world's first Jewish diaspora community, which emerged during the Babylonian exile.\n\nThe Babylonians were defeated by the Persian Empire, under the leadership of Cyrus the Great. Following the fall of Babylon, the Achaemenid Empire took control of the Mesopotamian region. Enslaved Jews were freed from the Babylonian captivity, though many remained in the land and thus the Jewish community grew in the region. Iraq is the location of numerous Jewish sites, which are also revered by the Muslims and Christians.\n\nIn the following centuries, the regions constituting modern Iraq came under the control of several empires, including the Greeks, Parthians, and Romans, establishing new centers like Seleucia and Ctesiphon. By the 3rd century AD, the region fell under Persian control through the Sasanian Empire, during which time Arab tribes from South Arabia migrated into Lower Mesopotamia, leading to the formation of the Sassanid-aligned Lakhmid kingdom.\n\nThe Arabic name al-ʿIrāq likely originated during this period. The Sasanian Empire was eventually conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century, bringing Iraq under Islamic rule after the Battle of al-Qadisiyyah in 636. The city of Kufa, founded shortly thereafter, became a central hub for the Rashidun dynasty until their overthrow by the Umayyads in 661. Karbala is considered as one of the holiest cities in Shia Islam, following the Battle of Karbala, which took place in 680.\n\nWith the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate in the mid-8th century, Iraq became the center of Islamic rule, with Baghdad, founded in 762, serving as the capital. Baghdad flourished during the Islamic Golden Age, becoming a global center for culture, science, and intellectualism. However, the city's prosperity declined following the Buwayhid and Seljuq invasions in the 10th century and suffered further with the Mongol invasion of 1258.\n\nIraq later came under the control of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. During the years 1747–1831, Iraq was ruled by a Mamluk dynasty of Georgian origin, who succeeded in obtaining autonomy from the Ottoman Empire. In 1831, the Ottomans managed to overthrow the Mamluk regime and reimposed their direct control over Iraq.\n\nIraq's modern history began in the wake of World War I, as the region emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.[46] Arab forces, inspired by the promise of independence, had helped dismantle the Ottoman hold on the Middle East, but the dream of a united, sovereign Arab state was soon dashed.[46] Despite agreements made with Hussein ibn Ali, the Sharif of Makkah, the European powers had different plans for the region. Following the British withdrawal of support for a unified Arab state, Hussein's son, Faisal, briefly declared the Kingdom of Syria in 1920, encompassing parts of what are now Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria.[46] However, the kingdom was short-lived, crushed by local opposition and the military might of France, which had been granted a mandate over Syria.[46]\n\nIn Iraq, under British mandate, tensions were rising as local forces increasingly resisted foreign control.[46] A rebellion erupted, challenging British authority, and the need for a new strategy became clear.[46] In 1921, the Cairo Conference, led by British officials including Winston Churchill and T. E. Lawrence, decided that Faisal, now exiled in London, would become the king of Iraq.[46] This decision was seen as a way to maintain British influence in the region while placating local demands for leadership.[46] Upon his coronation, he focused on unifying a land formerly divided into three Ottoman provinces—Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra.[46] He worked hard to gain the support of Iraq's diverse population, including both Sunnis and Shiites, and paid special attention to the country's Shiite communities, symbolically choosing the date of his coronation to coincide with Eid al-Ghadeer, a key day for Shiite Muslims.[46]\n\nHis reign laid the foundations of modern Iraq.[46] Faisal worked to establish key state institutions and fostered a sense of national identity.[46] His education reforms included the founding of Ahl al-Bayt University in Baghdad, and he encouraged the migration of Syrian exiles to Iraq to serve as doctors and educators.[46] Faisal also envisioned infrastructural links between Iraq, Syria, and Jordan, including plans for a railway and an oil pipeline to the Mediterranean.[46] Although Faisal succeeded in securing greater autonomy for Iraq, British influence remained strong, particularly in the country's oil industry.[46] In 1930, Iraq signed a treaty with Britain that gave the country a measure of political independence while maintaining British control over key aspects, including military presence and oil rights.[46] By 1932, Iraq gained formal independence, becoming a member of the League of Nations.[46] Faisal's reign was marked by his efforts to balance the pressures of external influence and internal demands for sovereignty.[46] He was admired for his diplomatic skill and his commitment to steering Iraq toward self-determination.[46] Untimely, he died from a heart attack on 8 September 1933, leaving his son Ghazi to inherit the throne.[46] King Ghazi's reign was brief and turbulent, as Iraq was impacted by numerous coup attempts.[46] He died in a motor accident in 1939, passing the throne to his young son, Faisal II, who ascended to the throne at just 3 years old.[46] Faisal II's uncle, Crown Prince Abdullah, assumed regency until the young king came of age.[46]\n\nOn 1 April 1941, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and members of the Golden Square staged a coup d'état and installed a pro-German and pro-Italian government.[46] During the subsequent Anglo-Iraqi War, the United Kingdom invaded Iraq for fear that the government might cut oil supplies to Western nations because of its links to the Axis powers.[46] The war started on 2 May, and the British, together with loyal Assyrian Levies, defeated the forces of Al-Gaylani, forcing an armistice on 31 May.[46] Regency of King Faisal II began in 1953.[46] The hopes for Iraq's future under Faisal II were high, but the nation remained divided.[46] Iraq's Sunni-dominated monarchy struggled to reconcile the diverse ethnic and religious groups, particularly the Shiite, Assyrian, Jewish and Kurdish populations, who felt marginalized.[46] In 1958, these tensions culminated in a military coup, inspired by the revolutionary wave sweeping across the Arab world, particularly the 1952 Egyptian Revolution.[47]\n\nA coup d'état known as the 14 July Revolution in 1958 was led by the Brigadier General and nationalist Abd al-Karim Qasim.[47] This revolt was strongly anti-imperial and anti-monarchical in nature and had strong socialist elements.[47] King Faysal II, Prince Abd al-Ilah, and Nuri al-Sa'id, along with the royal family were killed brutally.[47] Qasim controlled Iraq through military rule and in 1958 he began a process of forcibly reducing surplus land owned by a few citizens and having the state redistribute the land.[47] In 1959, Abd al-Wahab al-Shawaf led an uprising in Mosul against Qasim. The uprising was crushed by the government forces.[47] He claimed Kuwait as part of Iraq, when the former was granted independence in 1961.[47] The United Kingdom deployed its army on Iraq–Kuwait border, which forced Qasim to back down.[47] He was overthrown by the Ba'ath Party in February 1963 coup.[48] However internal division within Ba'athist factions caused another coup in November, which brought Colonel Abdul Salam Arif to power.[48] The new regime recognized Kuwait's independence.[48] After the latter's death in 1966, he was succeeded by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif.[48] Under his rule, Iraq participated in the Six Day War in 1967.[48]\n\nArif was overthrown in the 17 July Revolution in 1968.[49] The Ba'ath Party came to power, with Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr as the president of Iraq.[49] However, the government gradually came under the control of Saddam Hussein, Iraq's then vice-president.[49] Saddam sought to achieve stability between Iraq's ethnic and religious groups.[49] The first Iraqi–Kurdish war ended in 1970, after which a peace treaty was signed between Saddam and Barzani, granting autonomy to Kurds.[49] He introduced free healthcare and education, nationalized oil, promoted women's rights and developed infrastructure. Within a few years, Iraq became one of the most developed countries in the world.[49]\n\nIn 1974, the second Iraqi–Kurdish war began and border clashes with Iran took place on Shatt al-Arab. Iran supported Kurdish militants.[49] The Algiers Agreement signed in 1975, by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Saddam resolved the dispute and Iran withdrew support for the Kurds, resulting in their defeat in the war.[49] In 1973, Iraq participated in the Yom Kippur War against Israel, alongside Syria and Egypt.[49] An attempt to ban an annual pilgrimage Karbala caused an uprising by Shia Muslims across Iraq.[49] Another Shia uprising took place from 1979 to 1980, as a followup to the Islamic Revolution in Iran.[49] On 16 July 1979, Saddam acceded to the presidency and chairmanship of the supreme executive body in July 1979.[49]\n\nFollowing months of cross-border raids with Iran, Saddam declared war on Iran in September 1980, initiating the Iran–Iraq War (or First Persian Gulf War).[49] Taking advantage of the post-Iranian Revolution chaos in Iran, Iraq captured some territories in southwest Iran, but Iran recaptured all of the lost territories within two years, and for the next six years Iran was on the offensive.[page needed] The Sunni-led Arab countries and the United States supported Iraq throughout the war.[49] In 1981, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor of Iraq.[49] In midst of the war, between 1983 to 1986, Kurds led rebellion against the regime.[49] In retaliation, the government coordinated Anfal campaign, led to the killing of 50,000–100,000 civilians.[49] During the war, Saddam extensively used chemical weapons against Iranians.[49] The war, which ended in stalemate in 1988, killed between half a million and 1.5 million people.[49]\n\nKuwait's refusal to waive Iraq's debt and reducing oil prices pushed Saddam to take military action against it.[50] On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi forces invaded and annexed Kuwait as its 19th governorate, starting the Gulf War.[50] This led to military intervention by the United States-led alliance.[50] The coalition forces proceeded with a bombing campaign targeting military targets and then launched a 100-hour-long ground assault against Iraqi forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait.[50] Iraq also attempted to invade Saudi Arabia and attacked Israel.[50] Iraq's armed forces were devastated during the war.[50] Sanctions were imposed on Iraq, following the invasion of Kuwait, which resulted economic decline.[50] After the end of the war in 1991, Iraqi Kurds and Shi'ite Muslims in northern and southern Iraq, led several uprisings against Saddam's regime, but these were repressed.[50] It is estimated that as many as 100,000 people, including many civilians were killed.[50] During the uprisings, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey and France, claiming authority under UNSC Resolution 688, established the Iraqi no-fly zones to protect Kurdish population from attacks and autonomy was given to Kurds.[50] Iraq was also affected by the Iraqi Kurdish Civil War from 1994 to 1997.[50] Around 40,000 fighters and civilians were killed.[50] Between 2001 and 2003, the Kurdistan Regional Government and Ansar al-Islam engaged in conflict, which would merge with the upcoming war.[50]\n\nAfter the September 11 attacks, George W. Bush began planning the overthrow of Saddam in what is now widely regarded as a false pretense.[51] Saddam's Iraq was included in Bush's \"axis of evil\". The United States Congress passed joint resolution, which authorized the use of armed force against Iraq.[51] In November 2002. The UN Security Council passed resolution 1441.[51] On 20 March 2003, the United States-led coalition invaded Iraq, as part of global war on terror.[51] Within weeks, coalition forces occupied much of Iraq, with the Iraqi Army adopting guerrilla tactics to confront coalition forces.[51] Following the fall of Baghdad in the first week of April, Saddam's regime had completely lost control of Iraq.[51] A statue of Saddam was toppled in Baghdad, symbolizing the end of his rule.[51]\n\nThe Coalition Provisional Authority began disbanding the Ba'ath Army and expelling Ba'athists from the new government.[51] The insurgents fought against the coalition forces and the newly installed government.[51] Saddam was captured and executed.[51] The Shia–Sunni civil war took place from 2006 to 2008.[51] The coalition forces were criticized for war crimes such as the Abu Ghraib torture, the Fallujah massacre, the Mahmudiyah rape and killings and the Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre.[51] Following the withdrawal of US troops in 2011, the occupation ceased and war ended. The war in Iraq has resulted in between 151,000 and 1.2 million Iraqis being killed.[51]\n\nThe subsequent efforts to rebuild the country amidst sectarian violence and the rise of the Islamic State began after the war. Iraq was galvanized by the civil war in Syria. Continuing discontent over Nouri al-Maliki's government led to protests, after which a coalition of Ba'athist and Sunni militants launched an offensive against the government, initiating full-scale war in Iraq. The climax of the campaign was an offensive in Northern Iraq by the Islamic State (ISIS) that marked the beginning of the rapid territorial expansion by the group, prompting an American-led intervention. By the end of 2017, ISIS had lost all its territory in Iraq. Iran has also intervened and expanded its influence through sectarian Khomeinist militias.\n\nIn 2014, Sunni insurgents belonging to the Islamic State group seized control of large swathes of land including several major cities, like Tikrit, Fallujah and Mosul, creating hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons amid reports of atrocities by ISIL fighters. An estimated 500,000 civilians fled from Mosul. Around 5,000 Yazidis were killed in the genocide by ISIS, as a part of the war. With the help of US-led intervention in Iraq, the Iraqi forces successfully defeated ISIS. The war officially ended in 2017, with the Iraqi government declaring victory over ISIS. In October 2022, Abdul Latif Rashid was elected president after winning the parliamentary election.[52] In 2022, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani became Prime Minister.[53]\n\nThe electrical grid faces systemic pressures due to climate change, fuel shortages, and an increase in demand.[54][55][56] Corruption remains endemic throughout Iraqi governance while the United States-endorsed sectarian political system has driven increased levels of violent terrorism and sectarian conflicts.[57][58][56] Climate change is driving wide-scale droughts while water reserves are rapidly depleting.[59] The country has been in a prolonged drought since 2020 and experienced its second-driest season in the past four decades in 2021. Water flows in the Tigris and Euphrates are down 30-40%. Half the country's farmland is at risk of desertification.[56] Nearly 40% of Iraq \"has been overtaken by blowing desert sands that claim tens of thousands of acres of arable land every year.\"[60]\n\nIraq lies between latitudes 29° and 38° N, and longitudes 39° and 49° E (a small area lies west of 39°). Spanning 437,072 km2 (168,754 sq mi), it is the 58th-largest country in the world.\n\nIt has a coastline measuring 58 km (36 miles) on the northern Persian Gulf.[61] Further north, but below the main headwaters only, the country easily encompasses the Mesopotamian Alluvial Plain. Two major rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates, run south through Iraq and into the Shatt al-Arab, thence the Persian Gulf. Broadly flanking this estuary (known as arvandrūd: اروندرود among Iranians) are marshlands, semi-agricultural. Flanking and between the two major rivers are fertile alluvial plains, as the rivers carry about 60,000,000 m3 (78,477,037 cu yd) of silt annually to the delta.\n\nThe central part of the south, which slightly tapers in favour of other countries, is natural vegetation marsh mixed with rice paddies and is humid, relative to the rest of the plains.[citation needed] Iraq has the northwestern end of the Zagros mountain range and the eastern part of the Syrian Desert.[citation needed]\n\nRocky deserts cover about 40 percent of Iraq. Another 30 percent is mountainous with bitterly cold winters. The north of the country is mostly composed of mountains; the highest point being at 3,611 m (11,847 ft). Iraq is home to seven terrestrial ecoregions: Zagros Mountains forest steppe, Middle East steppe, Mesopotamian Marshes, Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests, Arabian Desert, Mesopotamian shrub desert, and South Iran Nubo-Sindian desert and semi-desert.[62]\n\nMuch of Iraq has a hot arid climate with subtropical influence. Summer temperatures average above 40 °C (104 °F) for most of the country and frequently exceed 48 °C (118.4 °F). Winter temperatures infrequently exceed 15 °C (59.0 °F) with maxima roughly 5 to 10 °C (41.0 to 50.0 °F) and night-time lows 1 to 5 °C (33.8 to 41.0 °F). Typically, precipitation is low; most places receive less than 250 mm (9.8 in) annually, with maximum rainfall occurring during the winter months. Rainfall during the summer is rare, except in northern parts of the country.\n\nThe northern mountainous regions have cold winters with occasional heavy snows, sometimes causing extensive flooding.[citation needed] Iraq is highly vulnerable to climate change.[63] The country is subject to rising temperatures and reduced rainfall, and suffers from increasing water scarcity for a human population that rose tenfold between 1890 and 2010 and continues to rise.[64][65]\n\nThe country's electrical grid faces systemic pressures due to climate change, fuel shortages, and an increase in demand.[54][55] Corruption remains endemic throughout all levels of Iraqi governance while the political system has exacerbated sectarian conflict.[57][58] Climate change is driving wide-scale droughts across the country while water reserves are rapidly depleting.[59] The country has been in a prolonged drought since 2020 and experienced its second-driest season in the past four decades in 2021. Water flows in the Tigris and Euphrates are down between 30 and 40%. Half of the country's farmland is at risk of desertification.[56] Nearly 40% of Iraq \"has been overtaken by blowing desert sands that claim tens of thousands of acres of arable land every year\".[60]\n\nHowever, in 2023, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani announced that government was working on a wider \"Iraqi vision for climate action\". The plan would include promoting clean and renewable energy, new irrigation and water treatment projects and reduced industrial gas flaring, he said. Sudani said Iraq was \"moving forward to conclude contracts for constructing renewable energy power plants to provide one-third of our electricity demand by 2030\". In addition, Iraq will plant 5 million trees across the country and will create green belts around cities to act as windbreaks against dust storms.[66][67]\n\nIn the same year, Iraq and TotalEnergies signed a $27 billion energy deal that aims to increase oil production and boost the country's capacity to produce energy with four oil, gas and renewables projects. According to experts, the project will \"accelerate Iraq's path to energy self-sufficiency and advance Iraq's collective climate change objectives\".[68][69]\n\nThe wildlife of Iraq includes its flora and fauna and their natural habitats.[70] Iraq has multiple and diverse biomes which include the mountainous region in the north to the wet marshlands along the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, while western part of the country comprises mainly desert and some semi-arid regions. Many of Iraq's bird species were endangered, including seven of Iraq's mammal species and 12 of its bird species. The Mesopotamian marches in the middle and south are home to approximately 50 species of birds, and rare species of fish.[71] At risk are some 50% of the world's marbled teal population that live in the marshes, along with 60% of the world's population of Basra reed-warbler.[71]\n\nThe Asiatic lion, in the present-day extinct in the region, has remained a prominent symbol of the country throughout history.[72] Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes, during the time of Saddam's government, caused there a significant drop in biological life.[73] Since the 2003–2011, flow is restored and the ecosystem has begun to recover.[73] Iraqi corals are some of the most extreme heat-tolerant as the seawater in this area ranges between 14 and 34 °C.[74] Aquatic or semi-aquatic wildlife occurs in and around these, the major lakes are Lake Habbaniyah, Lake Milh, Lake Qadisiyah and Lake Tharthar.[75]\n\nThe federal government of Iraq is defined under the current Constitution as a democratic, federal parliamentary republic. The federal government is composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, as well as numerous independent commissions. Aside from the federal government, there are regions (made of one or more governorates), governorates, and districts within Iraq with jurisdiction over various matters as defined by law.[40][76] The president is the head of state, the prime minister is the head of government, and the constitution provides for two deliberative bodies, the Council of Representatives and the Council of Union. The judiciary is free and independent of the executive and the legislature.[76]\n\nThe National Alliance is the main Shia parliamentary bloc, and was established as a result of a merger of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's State of Law Coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance.[77] The Iraqi National Movement is led by Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia widely supported by Sunnis.[77] The party has a more consistent anti-sectarian perspective than most of its rivals.[77] The Kurdistan List is dominated by two parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Masood Barzani and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan headed by Jalal Talabani.[77] Baghdad is Iraq's capital, home to the seat of government.[77][76][78] Located in the Green Zone, which contains governmental headquarters and the army, in addition to containing the headquarters of the American embassy and the headquarters of foreign organizations and agencies for other countries.\n\nAccording to the 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices Iraq was the third most electoral democratic country in the Middle East.[78] Under Saddam, the government employed 1 million employees, but this increased to around 7 million in 2016. In combination with decreased oil prices, the government budget deficit is near 25% of GDP as of 2016 .[79]\n\nIn October 2005, the new Constitution of Iraq was approved in a referendum with a 78% overall majority, although the percentage of support varied widely between the country's territories.[80] The new constitution was backed by the Shia and Kurdish communities, but was rejected by Arab Sunnis. Under the terms of the constitution, the country conducted fresh nationwide parliamentary elections on 15 December 2005. All three major ethnic groups in Iraq voted along ethnic lines, as did Assyrian and Turcoman minorities. Law no. 188 of the year 1959 (Personal Status Law)[81] made polygamy extremely difficult, granted child custody to the mother in case of divorce, prohibited repudiation and marriage under the age of 16.[82] Article 1 of Civil Code also identifies Islamic law as a formal source of law.[83] Iraq had no Sharia courts but civil courts used Sharia for issues of personal status including marriage and divorce. In 1995 Iraq introduced Sharia punishment for certain types of criminal offences.[84] The code is based on French civil law as well as Sunni and Jafari (Shi'ite) interpretations of Sharia.[85]\n\nIn 2004, the CPA chief executive L. Paul Bremer said he would veto any constitutional draft stating that sharia is the principal basis of law.[86] The declaration enraged many local Shia clerics,[87] and by 2005 the United States had relented, allowing a role for sharia in the constitution to help end a stalemate on the draft constitution.[88] The Iraqi Penal Code is the statutory law of Iraq.\n\nIraqi security forces are composed of forces serving under the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the Ministry of Defense (MOD), as well as the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Bureau (CTB), which oversees the Iraqi Special Operations Forces, and the Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC). Both CTB and PMC report directly to the Prime Minister of Iraq. MOD forces include the Iraqi Army, the Iraqi Air Force, Iraqi Navy, and the Iraqi Air Defence Command.[89] The MOD also runs a Joint Staff College, training army, navy, and air force officers, with support from the NATO Training Mission - Iraq. The college was established at Ar Rustamiyah on 27 September 2005.[90] The center runs Junior Staff and Senior Staff Officer Courses designed for first lieutenants to majors.\n\nThe current Iraqi armed forces was rebuilt on American foundation. The army consists of 13 infantry divisions and one motorised infantry. Each division consists of four brigades and comprises 14,000 soldiers. Before 2003, Iraq was mostly equipped with Soviet-made military equipment, but since then the country has turned to Western suppliers.[91] The Iraqi air force is designed to support ground forces with surveillance, reconnaissance and troop lift. Two reconnaissance squadrons use light aircraft, three helicopter squadrons are used to move troops and one air transportation squadron uses C-130 transport aircraft to move troops, equipment, and supplies. The air force currently has 5,000 personnel.[92]\n\nAs of February 2011, the navy had approximately 5,000 sailors, including 800 marines. The navy consists of an operational headquarters, five afloat squadrons, and two marine battalions, designed to protect shorelines and inland waterways from insurgent infiltration. On 4 November 2019, more than 100 Australian Defence Force personnel left Darwin for the 10th rotation of Task Group Taji, based north of Baghdad. The Australian contingent mentors the Iraqi School of Infantry, where the Iraqi Security Forces are trained. However, Australia's contribution was reduced from 250 to 120 ADF personnel, which along with New Zealand had trained over 45,000 ISF members before that.[93]\n\nIraq has followed different foreign policies under various regimes throughout its history. Under monarchical rule, it was pro-Western and part of the Baghdad Pact, an alliance against the Soviet Union during the Cold War.[94] During Qasim's rule, the country withdrew from the pact and formed close ties with the Eastern Bloc and claimed Kuwait as part of Iraq.[95][94] While the successive regime recognized Kuwait's independence.[95] Under Saddam Hussein, Iraq maintained ties with pro-Soviet countries.[95] It also provided financial support to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War and aid to rebuild Vietnam.[95] During this time, Iraq had close trade relations with India and Jordan. France, Germany, Belarus, Russia and China opposed the invasion of Iraq.[94]\n\nAfter the end of the war, Iraq sought and strengthened regional economic cooperation and improved relations with neighboring countries.[96] On 12 February 2009, Iraq officially became the 186th State Party to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Under the provisions of this treaty, Iraq is considered a party with declared stockpiles of chemical weapons. Because of their late accession, Iraq is the only State Party exempt from the existing timeline for destruction of their chemical weapons.[97] Since the situation eased, Iraq re-engaged with its Arab neighbors while maintaining relations with Iran in an attempt to position Iraq as a country that would not exacerbate the security concerns of its neighbors and seeking a pragmatic balance in foreign relations.[96]\n\nRelations with Iran have flourished since 2005 by the exchange of high-level visits.[96] A conflict occurred in December 2009, when Iraq accused Iran of seizing an oil well on the border.[98] Relations with Turkey are tense, largely because of the Kurdistan Regional Government, as clashes between Turkey and the PKK continue.[99] In October 2011, the Turkish parliament renewed a law that gives Turkish forces the ability to pursue rebels over the border in Iraq.[100] Turkey's \"Great Anatolia Project\" reduced Iraq's water supply and affected agriculture.[101][65] Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani has sought to normalise relations with Syria in order to expand co-operation.[102] Iraq is also seeking to deepen its ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.[103] Recently foreign ministers of Iraq and Kuwait have announced that they were working on a definitive agreement on border demarcation.[104][105]\n\nIran has also intervened since 2014, expanding through sectarian parties and Khomeinist militias.[106] The intervention traces its roots in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[106] Various militia groups that have emerged in the country since 2003 have ties with Iran.[106] The Islamic Resistance in Iraq and groups within the Popular Mobilization Forces are part of Iran's proxies — the Axis of Resistance, which includes other proxies from Lebanon, Palestine, Yemen, Bahrain, Afghanistan and Syria.[106] These Iraqi militias have also participated in confronting Israel, during the Israel–Hamas War, along with other groups of the Axis of Resistance.[106]\n\nIraq has emerged as an emerging middle power. It has played an important role in mediating talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia. In 2021, Baghdad hosted a meeting between Iranian and Saudi officials.[107] It has also hosted talks between Egypt, Jordan and Iran.[108]\n\nOn 17 November 2008, the US and Iraq agreed to a Status of Forces Agreement,[109] as part of the broader Strategic Framework Agreement.[110] On 5 January 2020, the Iraqi parliament voted for a resolution that urges the government to work on expelling US troops from Iraq.[106] The resolution was passed two days after a American drone strike that killed Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds Force.[106] The resolution specifically calls for ending of a 2014 agreement allowing Washington to help Iraq against Islamic State groups by sending troops.[111] This resolution will also signify ending an agreement with Washington to station troops in Iraq as Iran vows to retaliate after the killing.[112] On 28 September 2020, Washington made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq, as a result of Iranian-backed militias firing rockets at the American Embassy in Baghdad.[106][113] The officials said that the move was seen as an escalation of American confrontation with Iran.[114] The United States significantly reduced its military presence in Iraq after the defeat of ISIS.[113]\n\nRelations between Iraq and its Kurdish population have been sour in recent history, especially with Saddam Hussein's genocidal campaign against them in the 1980s. After uprisings during the early 90s, many Kurds fled their homeland and no-fly zones were established in northern Iraq to prevent more conflicts. Despite historically poor relations, some progress has been made, and Iraq elected its first Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani, in 2005. Furthermore, Kurdish is now an official language of Iraq alongside Arabic according to Article 4 of the Constitution.[40]\n\nLGBT rights in Iraq remain limited. Although decriminalised, homosexuality remains stigmatised in Iraqi society.[115] Human rights in Islamic State-controlled territory have been recorded as highly violated. It included mass executions in Islamic State-occupied part of Mosul and genocide of the Yazidis in Yazidi populated Sinjar, which is in northern Iraq.[116]\n\nIraq is composed of eighteen governorates (or provinces) (Arabic: muhafadhat, singular muhafadhah). The governorates are subdivided into districts (or qadhas), which are further divided into sub-districts (or nawāḥī). A nineteenth governorate, Halabja Governorate, is unrecognised by the Iraqi government. Clickable map of Iraq exhibiting its eighteen governorates, and partially recognized Halabja.\n\nIraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. The lack of development in other sectors has resulted in 18%–30% unemployed and a per capita GDP of $4,812.[3] Public sector employment accounted for nearly 60% of full-time employment in 2011.[117] The oil export industry, which dominates the Iraqi economy, generates little employment.[117] Currently only a modest percentage of women (the highest estimate for 2011 was 22%) participate in the labour force.[117]\n\nPrior to American occupation, Iraq's centrally planned economy prohibited foreign ownership of Iraqi businesses, ran most large industries as state-owned enterprises, and imposed large tariffs to keep out foreign goods.[118] During the regime of Saddam Hussein in the 1970s, Iraq was one of the most developed countries in the world.[119] After 2003, the Coalition Provisional Authority quickly began issuing many binding orders privatising Iraq's economy and opening it up to foreign investment. On 20 November 2004, the Paris Club of creditor countries agreed to write off 80% ($33 billion) of Iraq's $42 billion debt to Club members. Iraq's total external debt was around $120 billion at the time of the invasion, and had grown another $5 billion by 2004. The debt relief was to be implemented in three stages: two of 30% each and one of 20%.[120] The official currency in Iraq is the Iraqi dinar. The Coalition Provisional Authority issued new dinar coins and notes, with the notes printed by De La Rue using modern anti-forgery techniques.[121] Jim Cramer's 20 October 2009 endorsement of the Iraqi dinar on CNBC has further piqued interest in the investment.[122]\n\nFive years after the invasion, an estimated 2.4 million people were internally displaced (with a further two million refugees outside Iraq), four million Iraqis were considered food-insecure (a quarter of children were chronically malnourished) and only a third of Iraqi children had access to safe drinking water.[123] In 2022, and after more than 30 years after the UN Compensation Commission was created to ensure restitution for Kuwait following the invasion of 1990, the reparations body announced that Iraq has paid a total of $52.4 billion in war reparations to Kuwait.[124] According to the Overseas Development Institute, international NGOs face challenges in carrying out their mission, leaving their assistance \"piecemeal and largely conducted undercover, hindered by insecurity, a lack of coordinated funding, limited operational capacity and patchy information\".[123] International NGOs have been targeted and during the first 5 years, 94 aid workers were killed, 248 injured, 24 arrested or detained and 89 kidnapped or abducted.[123]\n\nIraq's \"dollar auction\" system, established after 2003, has become a conduit for massive financial fraud. This system allows Iraqi banks to purchase U.S. dollars from Iraq's oil revenues held at the Federal Reserve Bank. However, it has been exploited by fraudsters, terrorists, and money launderers to funnel billions of dollars out of Iraq. Despite warnings and evidence of fraud, American officials failed to take significant action for years. In 2015, an Iraqi parliamentary committee uncovered widespread fraud, including $6.5 billion obtained fraudulently by Al-Huda Bank. The typical fraud involved Iraqi banks submitting fake invoices and documents to obtain dollars, which were then sent to exchange houses or individuals instead of legitimate exporters. These misused funds have reportedly supported various U.S. adversaries, including Iran-backed militias, the Islamic State, and the Syrian regime. Recent U.S. actions have included sanctioning some Iraqi banks and individuals involved in the fraud, but critics argue these measures came too late. Specific examples of fraudulent transactions are provided, including those involving United Bank for Investment (UBI) and its chairman, Fadhil al-Dabbas. Experts suggest that U.S. inaction was due to various factors, including a focus on maintaining Iraqi dinar stability and the distraction of the war against the Islamic State. This long-standing financial abuse has had far-reaching consequences for both Iraq and U.S. interests in the region, highlighting the complexity of financial oversight in post-conflict environments.[125]\n\nAlthough overthrow of Saddam in 2003 have caused post-war conflict in Iraq, affecting the economy.[126][127] However, the Kurdish and Shia populated regions of Iraq have experienced economic boom since the end of the 2003–2011 war.[128][129][130] In addition, Iraq is an agricultural country. Tourism in Iraq stands to be a major growth sector, including archaeological tourism and religious tourism while the country is also considered to be a potential location for ecotourism.[131][132][133]\n\nIraq was an important tourist destination for many years but that changed dramatically during the war with Iran and after the invasion by the United States and allies.[134] As Iraq continues to develop and stabilizes, the tourism in Iraq is still facing many challenges, little has been made by the government to meet its tremendous potential as a global tourist destination, and gain the associated economic benefits, mainly due to conflicts.[135] Sites from Iraq's ancient past are numerous and many that are close to large cities have been excavated. Babylon has seen major recent restoration; known for its famous Ziggurat (the inspiration for the Biblical Tower of Babel), the Hanging Gardens (one of the Seven Wonders of the World), and the Ishtar Gate, making it a prime destination.\n\nNineveh, a rival to Babylon, has also seen significant restoration and reconstruction. Ur, one of the first Sumerian cities, which is near Nasiriyya, has been partially restored. This is a list of examples of some significant sites in a country with a tremendous archaeological and historic wealth.[136] Iraq is considered to be a potential location for ecotourism.[137] The tourism in Iraq includes also making pilgrimages to holy Shia Islamic sites near Karbala and Najaf.[130] Since 2003, Najaf and Karbala have experienced economic boom, due to religious tourism.[130] Mosul Museum is the second largest museum in Iraq after the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. It contains ancient Mesopotamian artifacts.\n\nSaddam Hussein built hundreds of palaces and monuments across the country. Some of them include Al-Faw Palace, As-Salam Palace and Radwaniyah Palace.[138] Al-Faw Palace is currently occupied by the American University of Iraq. Since Saddam's overthrow, the palaces are open to tourists, though they are not officially functioning, and the government of Iraq is considering to sell them for useful purposes. A majority of these structures were built after the 1991 Gulf War, when Iraq was put under sanctions by the United Nations.[138] Saddam reconstructed part of Babylon, one of the world's earliest cities, using bricks inscribed with his name to associate himself with the region's past glories.[139] One of his palaces in Basra was turned into a museum, despite it was time when Iraq allied with the United States was engaged in war with the ISIS.[140][clarification needed]\n\nIraq has a modern network of highways. Roadways extended 45,550 km (28,303 mi).[141] The roadway also connect Iraq to neighboring countries of Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.[141] There are more than seven million passenger cars, over million commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use. On major highways the maximum speed is 110 km/h (68 mph).[142]\n\nIraq has about 104 airports as of 2012. Major airports include Baghdad International Airport, Basra International Airport, Erbil International Airport, Kirkuk International Airport, Sulaimaniyah International Airport and Najaf International Airport.[143] Mosul International Airport was captured by ISIS militants during the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive.[144] Despite the government re-taking of the city, the airport remained closed. The government is constructing an international airport for Karbala and proposed an international airport in Nasiriyah, with partnership with China.[145]\n\nWith its 143.1 billion barrels (2.275×1010 m3) of proved oil reserves, Iraq ranks third in the world behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia in the amount of oil reserves.[146][147] Oil production levels reached 3.4 million barrels per day by December 2012.[148] Only about 2,000 oil wells have been drilled in Iraq, compared with about 1 million wells in Texas alone.[149] Iraq was one of the founding members of OPEC.[150][151]\n\nDuring the 1970s Iraq produced up to 3.5 million barrels per day, but sanctions imposed against Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990 crippled the country's oil sector. The sanctions prohibited Iraq from exporting oil until 1996 and Iraq's output declined by 85% in the years following the First Gulf War. The sanctions were lifted in 2003 after the US-led invasion removed Saddam Hussein from power, but development of Iraq's oil resources has been hampered by the ongoing conflict.[152] As of 2010 , despite improved security and billions of dollars in oil revenue, Iraq still generates about half the electricity that customers demand, leading to protests during the hot summer months.[153] The Iraq oil law, a proposed piece of legislation submitted to the Council of Representatives of Iraq in 2007, has failed to gain approval due to disagreements among Iraq's various political blocs.[154][155] Al Başrah Oil Terminal is a trans-shipment facility from the pipelines to the tankers and uses supertankers.\n\nAccording to a US Study from May 2007, between 100,000 barrels per day (16,000 m3/d) and 300,000 barrels per day (48,000 m3/d) of Iraq's declared oil production over the past four years could have been siphoned off through corruption or smuggling.[156] In 2008, Al Jazeera reported $13 billion of Iraqi oil revenues in American care was improperly accounted for, of which $2.6 billion is totally unaccounted for.[157] Some reports that the government has reduced corruption in public procurement of oil; however, reliable reports of bribery and kickbacks to government officials persist.[158]\n\nOn 30 June and 11 December 2009, the Ministry of Oil awarded service contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields.[159][160] Oil fields contracted include the \"super-giant\" Majnoon oil field, Halfaya Field, West Qurna Field and Rumaila Field.[160] BP and China National Petroleum Corporation won a deal to develop Rumaila, the largest oil field in Iraq.[161][162] On 14 March 2014, the International Energy Agency said Iraq's oil output jumped by half a million barrels a day in February to average 3.6 million barrels a day. The country had not pumped that much oil since 1979, when Saddam Hussein rose to power.[163] However, on 14 July 2014, as sectarian strife had taken hold, Kurdistan Regional Government forces seized control of the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oilfields in the north of the country, taking them from Iraq's control. Baghdad condemned the seizure and threatened \"dire consequences\" if the fields were not returned.[164] On 2018, the UN estimated that oil accounts for 99% of Iraq's revenue.[152] As of 2021, the oil sector provided about 92% of foreign exchange earnings.[165]\n\nThree decades of war greatly cut the existing water resources management system for several major cities. This prompted widespread water supply and sanitation shortfalls thus poor water and service quality.[65] This is combined with few businesses and households who are fully environmentally aware and legally compliant however the large lakes, as pictured, alleviate supply relative to many comparators in Western Asia beset by more regular drought. Access to potable water diverges among governorates and between urban and rural areas.\n\n91% of the population has access to potable water. Forming this figure: in rural areas, 77% of people have access to improved (treated or fully naturally filtered) drinking water sources; and 98% in urban areas.[166] Much water is discarded during treatment, due to much outmoded equipment, raising energy burden and reducing supply.[166]\n\nAlthough many infrastructure projects had already begun, at the end of 2013 Iraq had a housing crisis. The then war-ravaged country was set to complete 5 percent of the 2.5 million homes it needs to build by 2016 to keep up with demand, confirmed the Minister for Construction and Housing.[167] In 2009, the Iraq Britain Business Council formed. Its key impetus was House of Lords member and trade expert Lady Nicholson. In mid 2013, South Korean firm Daewoo reached a deal to build Bismayah New City of about 600,000 residents in 100,000 homes.[168] In December 2020, Al-Sudani launched the second phase of the Grand Faw Port via winning bid of project head contractor Daewood at $2.7 billion.[169] In late 2023, the government announced that it will build a total of 15 new cities across Iraq, in an attempt to tackle a persistent housing problem, according to officials.[170] This project falls under the government's plan and strategy to establish new residential cities outside city centers, aiming to alleviate the urban housing crisis.[171] The first 5 new cities cities will be located in Baghdad, Babylon, Nineveh, Anbar and Karbala, while another 10 new residential cities will be launched in other governorates.[171] The initial phase of the [housing] plan began in late 2023, when Al-Sudani laid the foundation stone of Al-Jawahiri city.[171] Located west of the capital, the new city will host 30,000 housing units which will cost $2 billion.[171] It is expected to be completed in four to five years. According to officials, none of it is financed by the government.[172][173][171]\n\nIn 2024, and during a visit to Baghdad by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a quadrilateral memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation in Iraq Development Road project was signed between Iraq, Türkiye, Qatar, UAE. The deal was inked by the transportation ministers from each country. The 1,200-kilometer project with railway and highways which will connect the Grand Faw Port, aimed to be the largest port in the Middle East. It is planned to be completed by 2025 to the Turkish border at an expected cost of $17 billion. According to officials, it is a strategic national project for Iraq, and will become the largest sea port in the Middle East, as such strengthening Iraq's geopolitical position.[174][175][176]\n\nThe 2021 estimate of the total Iraqi population is 43,533,592.[177][178] Iraq's population was estimated to be 2 million in 1878.[179] In 2013 Iraq's population reached 35 million amid a post-war population boom.[180] Those three vilayets of the Ottoman Empire — Mosul, Basra and Baghdad — were designated as concentration of different ethnic groups.\n\nIraq's native population is predominantly Arab, but also includes other ethnic groups such as Kurds, Turkmens, Assyrians, Yazidis, Shabaks, Armenians, Mandaeans, Circassians, and Kawliya.\n\nA report by the European Parliamentary Research Service suggests that, in 2015, there were 24 million Arabs (14 million Shia and 9 million Sunni); 4.7 million Sunni Kurds (plus 500,000 Faili Kurds and 200,000 Kaka'i); 3 million (mostly Sunni) Iraqi Turkmens; 1 million Black Iraqis; 500,000 Christians (including Assyrians and Armenians); 500,000 Yazidis; 250,000 Shabaks; 50,000 Roma; 3,000 Mandaeans; 2,000 Circassians; 1,000 of the Baháʼí Faith; and a few dozens Jews.[182]\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, citing a 1987 Iraqi government estimate,[3] the population of Iraq is 75–80% Arab followed by 15–20% Kurds.[3] In addition, the estimate claims that other minorities form 5% of the country's population, including the Turkmen/Turcoman, Assyrians, Yezidis, Shabak, Kaka'i, Bedouins, Roma, Circassians, Mandaeans, and Persians.[3] However, the International Crisis Group points out that figures from the 1987 census, as well as the 1967, 1977, and 1997 censuses, \"are all considered highly problematic, due to suspicions of regime manipulation\" because Iraqi citizens were only allowed to indicate belonging to either the Arab or Kurdish ethnic groups;[183] consequently, this skewed the number of other ethnic minorities, such as Iraq's third largest ethnic group – the Turkmens.[183]\n\nThe historic Assyrian Quarter in Baghdad housed 150,000 Armenians in 2003. Most of them fled, following the escalation of war, and today only 1,500 Armenians are found in the city. Around 20,000 Marsh Arabs live in southern Iraq.[184] Iraq has a community of 2,500 Chechens,[185] and some 20,000 Armenians.[186] In southern Iraq, there is a community of Iraqis of African descent, a legacy of the slavery practised in the Islamic Caliphate beginning before the Zanj Rebellion of the 9th century, and Basra's role as a key port.[187] It is the most populous country in the Arabian Plate.[188]\n\nThe main languages spoken in Iraq are Mesopotamian Arabic and Kurdish, followed by the Iraqi Turkmen/Turkoman dialect of Turkish, and the Neo-Aramaic languages (specifically Chaldean and Assyrian dialects).[189] Arabic and Kurdish are written with versions of the Arabic script. Since 2005, the Turkmen/Turkoman have switched from the Arabic script to the Turkish alphabet.[190] In addition, the Neo-Aramaic languages use the Syriac script. Other smaller minority languages include Mandaic, Shabaki, Armenian, Circassian and Persian.\n\nPrior to the invasion in 2003, Arabic was the sole official language. Since the new Constitution of Iraq was approved in 2005, both Arabic and Kurdish are recognised (Article 4) as official languages of Iraq, while three other languages, Turkmen, Syriac and Armenian, are also recognised as minority languages. In addition, any region or province may declare other languages official if a majority of the population approves in a general referendum.[40]\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Iraq (Article 4): The Arabic language and the Kurdish language are the two official languages of Iraq. The right of Iraqis to educate their children in their mother tongue, such as Turkmen, Syriac, and Armenian shall be guaranteed in government educational institutions in accordance with educational guidelines, or in any other language in private educational institutions.[40]\n\nReligions in Iraq are dominantly Abrahamic religions.[191] The CIA World Factbook estimated in 2015 that between 90 and 95% of Iraqis followed Islam, with 61–64% being Shia and 29–34% being Sunni. Christianity accounted for 1%, and the rest (1-4%) practiced Yazidism, Mandaeism, and other religions.[191] An older 2011 Pew Research Center estimated that 51% of Muslims in Iraq see themselves as Shia, 42% as Sunni, while 5% as \"just a Muslim\".[192] Iraq is also home to two of the holiest places among the Shi'as – Najaf and Karbala.[193] Shia Muslims are mostly concentrated in southern Iraq and in parts of north region and Baghdad. Sunni Muslims are found in the Sunni Triangle region, in cities such as Ramadi, Tikrit and Fallujah, where Sunnis make majority.\n\nChristianity in Iraq has its roots from the conception of the Church of the East in the 5th century AD, predating the existence of Islam in the region of Iraq.[194] Iraqi Christians are predominantly native Assyrians belonging to the Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Catholic Church and Syriac Orthodox Church.[194][195] There is also a significant population of Armenian Christians in Iraq who had fled Turkey during the Armenian genocide.[194][195] Christians numbered over 1.4 million in 1987 or 8% of the estimated population of 16.3 million and 550,000 in 1947 or 12% of the population of 4.6 millions.[196] After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, violence against Christians rose, with reports of abduction, torture, bombings, and killings.[197][198][195] The post-2003 war have displaced much of the remaining Christian community from their homeland as a result of ethnic and religious persecution at the hands of Islamic extremists.[199][200][201][202][203]\n\nIraq is home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the Middle East and the first Jewish diaspora.[204] In 1948, the Jewish population was estimated at approximately 200,000, although some sources suggest the population may have been even higher.[204] After the establishment of Israel in 1948, Jews emigrated, fleeing persecution in Iraq, while 100,000 of them remained.[205] By the time Saddam Hussein came to power, their population had reached 15,000.[206][207] Under his rule, the population dwindled—not due to persecution, but because the government lifted travel restrictions, allowing many Jews to emigrate abroad and visiting Iraq occasionally.[208] At this point, around 1,500 Jews remained.[209] After 2003, fear among the Jewish community increased, leading to their further decline.[210] Today, it is estimated that only around 400 Jews remain in Iraq.[211] Iraq is home to over 250 Jewish sites.\n\nThere are also small ethno-religious minority populations of Mandaeans, Shabaks, Yarsan and Yezidis remaining.[198] Prior to 2003 their numbers together may have been 2 million, the majority Yarsan, a non-Islamic religion with roots in pre-Islamic and pre-Christian religion.[198] Yazidis are mostly concentrated around the Sinjar Mountains.[212][198] Mandaeans live primarily around Baghdad, Fallujah, Basra and Hillah.[213][198]\n\nThe dispersion of native Iraqis to other countries is known as the Iraqi diaspora. The UN High Commission for Refugees has estimated that nearly two million Iraqis fled the country after the multinational invasion of Iraq in 2003.[214] The UN Refugee agency estimated in 2021 that 1.1 million were displaced within the country.[215] In 2007, the UN said that about 40% of Iraq's middle class was believed to have fled and that most had fled systematic persecution and had no desire to return.[216] Subsequently, the diaspora seemed to be returning, as security improved; the Iraqi government claimed that 46,000 refugees returned to their homes in October 2007 alone.[217]\n\nIn 2011, nearly 3 million Iraqis had been displaced, with 1.3 million within Iraq and 1.6 million in neighbouring countries, mainly Jordan and Syria.[218][219][220] More than half of Iraqi Christians had fled the country since the US-led invasion.[219][220] According to official United States Citizenship and Immigration Services statistics, 58,811 Iraqis had been granted refugee-status citizenship as of 25 May 2011 .[221] After the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, numerous Iraqis in Syria returned to their native country.[222] To escape the Syrian civil war, over 252,000 Syrian refugees of varying ethnicities have fled to Iraq since 2012.[223]\n\nIn 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 6.84% of the country's GDP. In 2008, there were 6.96 physicians and 13.92 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.[224] The life expectancy at birth was 68.49 years in 2010, or 65.13 years for males and 72.01 years for females.[225] This is down from a peak life expectancy of 71.31 years in 1996.[226]\n\nIraq had developed a centralised free health care system in the 1970s using a hospital based, capital-intensive model of curative care. The country depended on large-scale imports of medicines, medical equipment and even nurses, paid for with oil export income, according to a \"Watching Brief\" report issued jointly by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in July 2003. Unlike other poorer countries, which focused on mass health care using primary care practitioners, Iraq developed a Westernised system of sophisticated hospitals with advanced medical procedures, provided by specialist physicians. The UNICEF/WHO report noted that prior to 1990, 97% of the urban dwellers and 71% of the rural population had access to free primary health care; just 2% of hospital beds were privately managed.[227]\n\nIn 2024, Prime Minister Mohammed Shi'a Al-Sudani officially inaugurated Shaab General Hospital, Baghdad's first new general hospital in nearly 40 years. The 246-bed facility, which was a long-delayed project was completed under a collaborative management model, which boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure, with advanced medical equipment, and a full range of healthcare services according to Sudani.[228] Iraqi Minister of Health Salih Hasnawi highlighted the ministry's accomplishments over the past two years, including the construction of 13 new hospitals, three specialized centers, two burn units, and 25 kidney treatment centers in different governorates, while plans are in place to build 16 new hospitals, each with 100 beds, to be managed by qualified companies.[229][230] In the same year, the government of Iraq launched the implementation of a joint operation and management program for modern hospitals at the newly opened Najaf Teaching Hospital.[231]\n\nBefore Iraq faced economic sanctions from the UN and was invaded by the United States, it already had an advanced and successful education system.[232] However, it has now been \"de-developing\" in its educational success.[232] Although Saddam was viewed as a repressive leader, his government successfully turned Iraq into a leading center of higher education.[232] Since the implementation of the MDGs, education in Iraq has shown improvement. Enrollment numbers nearly doubled from 2000 to 2012, reaching six million students.[233] By 2015–2016, around 9.2 million children were attending school, with a steady annual increase of 4.1% in enrollment rates.[233]\n\nHowever, the rapid increase in primary education students has strained the system.[233] Education receives only 5.7% of government spending, leading to a lack of investment in schools and poor educational rankings in the region.[233] UNICEF found that funding has been wasted, resulting in increasing dropout and repetition rates.[233] Dropout rates range from 1.5% to 2.5%, with girls being affected more due to economic or family reasons. Repetition rates have reached almost 17%, causing a loss of approximately 20% of education funding in 2014–2015.[233] Regional disparities greatly impact enrollment rates for children in primary education in Iraq.[233] Conflict-ridden areas like Saladin have seen over 90% of school-age children out of school due to the conversion of schools into shelters or military bases.[233] Limited resources strain the education system, hindering access to education.[233] However, efforts have been made to reopen closed schools, with success seen in Mosul, where over 380,000 children are back in school.[233] Access to education varies depending on location, and there are disparities between boys and girls.[233]\n\nIn 2024, the government of Iraq inaugurated 790 new schools across the country, as part of a framework agreement with China to build 1,000 schools. This initiative aims to address overcrowding and the issue of triple shifts in schools, which have been exacerbated by the destruction caused by years of conflict. Many schools have had to operate multiple shifts, sometimes giving students as little as four hours of learning per day, which negatively affects educational outcomes.[234][235]\n\nThe school construction project stems from a 2021 agreement between the Iraqi and Chinese governments to build 1,000 schools. Additionally, the Iraqi Prime Minister announced that the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) will soon collaborate with the private sector to build 400 more schools, addressing the current shortage of over 8,000 schools in the country.[234][235]\n\nIraq's culture has a deep heritage that extends back in time to ancient Mesopotamian culture. Iraq has one of the longest written traditions in the world including architecture, literature, music, dance, painting, weaving, pottery, calligraphy, stonemasonry and metalworking. The culture of Iraq or Mesopotamia is one of the world's oldest cultural histories and is considered one of the most influential cultures in the world.\n\nMesopotamian legacy went on to influence and shape the civilizations of the Old World in different ways such as inventing writing system, mathematics, time, calendar, astrology and the law code.[17][18] Iraq is home to diverse ethnic groups that have each contributed in different ways to the country's long and rich heritage. The country is known for its poets, architects, painters and sculptors, who are among the best in the region, some of them being world-class. Iraq is known for producing fine handicrafts, including rugs and carpets.\n\nThere were several interconnected traditions of art in ancient Iraq. The Abbasid Dynasty developed in the Abbasid Caliphate between 750 and 945, primarily in its heartland of Mesopotamia. The Abbasids were influenced mainly by Mesopotamian art traditions and later influenced Persian as well as Central Asian styles. Between the 8th and 13th centuries during the Abbasid period, pottery achieved a high level of sophistication, calligraphy began to be used to decorate the surface of decorative objects and illuminated manuscripts, particularly Q'ranic texts became more complex and stylised. Iraq's first art school was established during this period, allowing artisans and crafts to flourish.[237]\n\nAt the height of the Abbasid period, in the late 12th century, a stylistic movement of manuscript illustration and calligraphy emerged. Now known as the Baghdad School, this movement of Islamic art was characterised by representations of everyday life and the use of highly expressive faces rather than the stereotypical characters that had been used in the past.[238]\n\nThe architecture of Iraq has a long history, encompassing several distinct cultures and spanning a period from the 10th millennium BC and features both the Mesopotamian and Abbasid architecture.[239] Baghdad and Mosul have plethora of cultural and heritage buildings. There are numerous historic mosques in Baghdad and Basra, old churches in Mosul and synagogues in Baghdad.[239] Modern prominent architects include Zaha Hadid, Basil Bayati, Rifat Chadirji and Hisham N. Ashkouri among others.[239]\n\nThe capital, Ninus or Nineveh, was taken by the Medes under Cyaxares, and some 200 years after Xenophon passed over its site, then mere mounds of earth. It remained buried until 1845, when Botta and Layard discovered the ruins of the Assyrian cities. The principal remains are those of Khorsabad, 16 km (10 mi) northeast of Mosul; of Nimroud, supposed to be the ancient Calah; and of Kouyunjik, in all probability the ancient Nineveh. In these cities are found fragments of several great buildings which seem to have been palace-temples. They were constructed chiefly of sun-dried bricks, and all that remains of them is the lower part of the walls, decorated with sculpture and paintings, portions of the pavements, a few indications of the elevation, and some works connected with the drainage. Recent years's modern buildings includes shopping malls and high-rise towers.\n\nImportant cultural institutions in the capital include the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra – rehearsals and performances were briefly interrupted during the occupation of Iraq but have since returned to normal.[240] The National Theatre of Iraq was looted during the 2003 invasion, but efforts are underway to restore it. The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s when UN sanctions limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 cinemas were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of comedies and dramatic productions.\n\nInstitutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include the Academy of Music, Institute of Fine Arts and the Music and Ballet School Baghdad. Baghdad also features a number of museums including the National Museum of Iraq – which houses the world's largest and finest collection of artefacts and relics of Ancient Iraqi civilisations; some of which were stolen during the occupation of Iraq. On 2021, it was announced that Iraq had reclaimed about 17,000 looted artifacts, which was considered to be the biggest repatriation.[242]\n\nThe literature in Iraq is often referred to as \"Mesopotamian literature\" due to the flourishing of various civilisations as a result of the mixture of these cultures and has been called Mesopotamian or Babylonian literature in allusion to the geographical territory that such cultures occupied in the Middle East between the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.[243] The Sumerian literature was unique because it does not belong to any known linguistic root. Its appearance began with symbols of the things denoting it, then it turned with time to the cuneiform line on tablets. The literature during this time were mainly about mythical and epic texts dealing with creation issues, the emergence of the world, the gods, descriptions of the heavens, and the lives of heroes in the wars that broke out between the nomads and the urbanites. They also deal with religious teachings, moral advice, astrology, legislation, and history. One of which was the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is regarded as the earliest surviving notable literature.[244]\n\nDuring the Abbasid Caliphate, the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, which was a public academy and intellectual center, hosted numerous scholars and writers. A number of stories in One Thousand and One Nights feature famous Abbasid figures.[245] Iraq has various medieval poets, most remarkably Hariri of Basra, Mutanabbi, Abu Nuwas, and Al-Jahiz. In modern times, various languages are used in Iraqi literature including Arabic, Neo-Aramaic, Kurdish and Turkish, although the Arabic literature remains the most influential literature. Notably poets include Jawahiri, Safa Khulusi and Dunya Mikhail.\n\nIraq is known primarily for its rich maqam heritage which has been passed down orally by the masters of the maqam in an unbroken chain of transmission leading up to the present. The Iraqi maqam is considered to be the most noble and perfect form of maqam. Al-maqam al-Iraqi is the collection of sung poems written either in one of the sixteen meters of classical Arabic or in Iraqi dialect (Zuhayri).[246] This form of art is recognised by UNESCO as \"an intangible heritage of humanity\".[247]\n\nEarly in the 20th century, many of the most prominent musicians in Iraq were Jewish.[248] In 1936, Iraq Radio was established with an ensemble made up entirely of Jews, with the exception of the percussion player.[248] At the nightclubs of Baghdad, ensembles consisted of oud, qanun and two percussionists, while the same format with a ney and cello were used on the radio.[248]\n\nThe most famous singer of the 1930s–1940s was perhaps Salima Pasha (later Salima Murad).[248][249] The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time since public performance by women was considered shameful.[248] The most famous early composer from Iraq was Ezra Aharon, an oud player, while the most prominent instrumentalist was Yusuf Za'arur.[citation needed] Za'arus formed the official ensemble for the Iraqi radio station and were responsible for introducing the cello and ney into the traditional ensemble.[248]\n\nIraq was home to the second television station in the Middle East, which began during the 1950s. As part of a plan to help Iraq modernise, English telecommunications company Pye Limited built and commissioned a television broadcast station in the capital city of Baghdad.[250]\n\nAfter the end of the full state control in 2003, there were a period of significant growth in the broadcast media in Iraq.[251] By mid-2003, according to a BBC report, there were 20 radio stations from 0.15 to 17 television stations owned by Iraqis, and 200 Iraqi newspapers owned and operated.\n\nIraqi media expert and author of a number of reports on this subject, Ibrahim Al Marashi, identifies four stages of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 where they had been taking the steps that have significant effects on the way for the later of the Iraqi media since then. Stages are: pre-invasion preparation, and the war and the actual choice of targets, the first post-war period, and a growing insurgency and hand over power to the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) and Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.[252][page needed]\n\nIraqi cuisine can be traced back some 10,000 years – to the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians and Ancient Persians.[253] Tablets found in ancient ruins in Iraq show recipes prepared in the temples during religious festivals – the first cookbooks in the world.[253] Ancient Iraq, or Mesopotamia, was home to many sophisticated and highly advanced civilisations, in all fields of knowledge – including the culinary arts.[253] However, it was in the medieval era when Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith.[253] Today the cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance as well as strong influences from the culinary traditions of neighbouring Turkey, Iran and the Greater Syria area.[253]\n\nSome characteristic ingredients of Iraqi cuisine include – vegetables such as aubergine, tomato, okra, onion, potato, courgette, garlic, peppers and chilli, cereals such as rice, bulgur wheat and barley, pulses and legumes such as lentils, chickpeas and cannellini, fruits such as dates, raisins, apricots, figs, grapes, melon, pomegranate and citrus fruits, especially lemon and lime.[253]\n\nSimilarly with other countries of Western Asia, chicken and especially lamb are the favourite meats. Most dishes are served with rice – usually Basmati, grown in the marshes of southern Iraq.[253] Bulgur wheat is used in many dishes, having been a staple in the country since the days of the Ancient Assyrians.[253]\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Iraq. Basketball, swimming, weightlifting, bodybuilding, boxing, kick boxing and tennis are also popular sports.\n\nThe Iraq Football Association is the governing body of football in Iraq, controlling the Iraq national football team and the Iraq Stars League. It was founded in 1948, and has been a member of FIFA since 1950 and the Asian Football Confederation since 1971. Iraq were champions of the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, and they participated in the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n• Presidency – official website of the president of Iraq\n• Prime Minister – official website of the prime minister of Iraq\n• \"History\" – Iraqi History at Embassy of the Republic of Iraq in WashingtonIraq War - Wikipedia: War in Iraq from 2003 to 2011\n\nThe Iraq War (Arabic: حرب العراق, romanized: ḥarb al-ʿirāq), also referred to as the Second Gulf War,[84][85] was a prolonged conflict in Iraq lasting from 2003 to 2011. It began with the invasion by a United States-led coalition, which resulted in the overthrow of the Ba'athist government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict persisted as an insurgency arose against coalition forces and the newly established Iraqi government. US forces were officially withdrawn in 2011. In 2014, the US became re-engaged in Iraq, leading a new coalition under Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, as the conflict evolved into the ongoing insurgency.\n\nThe Iraq invasion was part of the Bush administration's broader war on terror, launched in response to the September 11 attacks. In October 2002, the US Congress passed a resolution granting Bush the authority to use military force against Iraq. The war began on March 20, 2003, when the US, joined by the UK, Australia, and Poland, initiated a \"shock and awe\" bombing campaign. Following the bombings, coalition forces launched a ground invasion, defeating Iraqi forces and toppling the Ba'athist regime. Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003 and executed in 2006.\n\nThe fall of Saddam's regime created a power vacuum, which, along with the Coalition Provisional Authority's mismanagement, fueled a sectarian civil war between Iraq's Shia majority and Sunni minority, and contributed to a lengthy insurgency. In response, the US deployed an additional 170,000 troops during the 2007 troop surge, which helped stabilize parts of the country. In 2008, President Bush agreed to withdraw all US combat troops, a process completed in 2011 under President Barack Obama.\n\nThe primary justifications for the invasion centered around fabricated[86] claims Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and that Saddam Hussein was supporting al-Qaeda. However, the 9/11 Commission concluded in 2004 that there was no credible evidence linking Saddam to al-Qaeda, and no WMD stockpiles were ever found in Iraq. These false claims faced widespread criticism, in the US and abroad. Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations, declared the invasion illegal under international law, as it violated the UN Charter. The 2016 Chilcot Report, a British inquiry, concluded the war was unnecessary, as peaceful alternatives had not been fully explored. In 2005, Iraq held multi-party elections, and Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in 2006, a position he held until 2014. His government's policies alienated Iraq's Sunni minority, exacerbating sectarian tensions.\n\nThe war led to an estimated 150,000 to over a million deaths, including more than 100,000 civilians. Many deaths occurred during the insurgency and subsequent civil war. The conflict had lasting geopolitical effects, including the rise and expansion of extremist groups like Islamic State. It also contributed to the outbreak of the 2013–2017 War in Iraq, which caused over 155,000 deaths and displaced millions of Iraqis. The war severely damaged the US' international reputation, and Bush's popularity declined sharply. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair's support for the war diminished his standing, contributing to his resignation in 2007.\n\nStrong international opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime began following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The international community condemned the invasion,[87] and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the Gulf War to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.\n\nFollowing the Gulf War, the US and its allies tried to keep Saddam Hussein in check with a policy of containment. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the UN Security Council; the enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones declared by the US and the UK to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shias in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government, and ongoing inspections to ensure Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe inspections were carried out by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM). UNSCOM, in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, worked to ensure that Iraq destroyed its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and facilities.[88]\n\nIn the decade following the Gulf War, the United Nations passed 16 Security Council resolutions calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Member states communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the special commission and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi officials harassed the inspectors and obstructed their work,[88] and in August 1998, the Iraqi government suspended cooperation with the inspectors completely, alleging that the inspectors were spying for the US.[89] The spying allegations were later substantiated.[90]\n\nIn October 1998, removing the Iraqi government became official US foreign policy with the enactment of the Iraq Liberation Act. The act provided $97 million for Iraqi \"democratic opposition organizations\" to \"establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq.\"[91] This legislation contrasted with the terms set out in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which focused on weapons and weapons programs and made no mention of regime change.[92]\n\nOne month after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act, the US and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called Operation Desert Fox. The campaign's express rationale was to hamper Saddam Hussein's government's ability to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but US intelligence personnel also hoped it would help weaken Saddam's grip on power.[93]\n\nFollowing the election of George W. Bush as president in 2000, the US moved towards a more aggressive Iraq policy. The Republican Party's campaign platform in the 2000 election called for \"full implementation\" of the Iraq Liberation Act as \"a starting point\" in a plan to \"remove\" Saddam.[94]\n\nLittle formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the September 11 attacks, although plans were drafted and meetings were held from the first days of his administration.[95][96]\n\nFollowing 9/11, the Bush administration's national security team actively debated an invasion of Iraq. On the day of the attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked his aides for: \"best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit Saddam Hussein at the same time. Not only Osama bin Laden.\"[98] President Bush spoke with Rumsfeld on 21 November and instructed him to conduct a confidential review of OPLAN 1003, the war plan for invading Iraq.[99][100] Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks, the commander of US Central Command, on 27 November to go over the plans. A record of the meeting includes the question \"How start?\", listing multiple possible justifications for a US–Iraq War.[97][101] The rationale for invading Iraq as a response to 9/11 has been refuted, as there was no cooperation between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.[102][103][104][105][106][107]\n\nPresident Bush began laying the public groundwork for an invasion of Iraq in January 2002 State of the Union address, calling Iraq a member of the Axis of Evil, and saying \"The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons.\"[108] Bush said this and made many other dire allegations about the threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction despite the fact that the Bush administration knew that Iraq had no nuclear weapons and had no information about whether Iraq had biological weapons.[109][110][111][112][113] He began formally making his case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq in his 12 September 2002 address to the UN Security Council.[114] However, a 5 September 2002 report from Major General Glen Shaffer revealed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff's J2 Intelligence Directorate had concluded that the United States' knowledge on different aspects of the Iraqi WMD program ranged from essentially zero to about 75%, and that knowledge was particularly weak on aspects of a possible nuclear weapons program: \"Our knowledge of the Iraqi nuclear weapons program is based largely – perhaps 90% – on analysis of imprecise intelligence,\" they concluded. \"Our assessments rely heavily on analytic assumptions and judgment rather than hard evidence. The evidentiary base is particularly sparse for Iraqi nuclear programs.\"[115][116] Similarly, the British government found no evidence that Iraq possessed nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction and that Iraq posed no threat to the West, a conclusion British diplomats shared with the US government.[117]\n\nKey US allies in NATO, such as the United Kingdom, agreed with the US actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised \"serious consequences\" for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government.[119] The US and UK ambassadors to the UN publicly confirmed this reading of the resolution.[120]\n\nResolution 1441 set up inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix and IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. As of February 2003, the IAEA \"found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq\"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses.[121] In March 2003, Blix said progress had been made in inspections, and no evidence of WMD had been found.[122]\n\nIn October 2002, the US Congress passed the \"Iraq Resolution\",[123] which authorized the President to \"use any means necessary\" against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush's plan (see popular opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq). The US government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to promote the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.[124]\n\nOn 5 February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN to present evidence that Iraq was hiding unconventional weapons. However, despite warnings from the German Federal Intelligence Service and the British Secret Intelligence Service that the source was untrustworthy, Powell's presentation included information based on the claims of Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed \"Curveball\", an Iraqi emigrant living in Germany who also later admitted that his claims had been false.[125] Powell also claimed that Iraq was covertly harbouring and supporting al-Qaeda networks. Additionally, Powell alleged that al-Qaeda was attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction from Iraq:\n\nAs a follow-up to Powell's presentation, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy. Facing a losing vote as well as a likely veto from France and Russia, the US, the UK, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Australia eventually withdrew their resolution.[127][128]\n\nIn March 2003, the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq with a host of public relations and military moves. In an address to the nation on 17 March 2003, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.[129]\n\nThe UK House of Commons held a debate on going to war on 18 March 2003 where the government motion was approved 412 to 149.[130] The vote was a key moment in the history of the Blair government, as the number of government MPs who rebelled against the vote was the greatest since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, John Denham, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and the then Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook.\n\nIn October 2002, former US President Bill Clinton warned about the possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq. Speaking in the UK at a Labour Party conference he said: \"As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future... I don't care how precise your bombs and your weapons are when you set them off, innocent people will die.\"[131][132] Of 209 House Democrats in Congress, 126 voted against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, although 29 of 50 Democrats in the Senate voted in favor of it. Only one Republican Senator, Lincoln Chafee, voted against it. The Senate's lone Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against it. Retired US Marine, former Navy Secretary and future US senator Jim Webb wrote shortly before the vote, \"Those who are pushing for a unilateral war in Iraq know full well that there is no exit strategy if we invade.\"[133]\n\nIn the same period, Pope John Paul II publicly condemned the military intervention. During a private meeting, he also said directly to George W. Bush: \"Mr. President, you know my opinion about the war in Iraq. Let's talk about something else. Every violence, against one or a million, is a blasphemy addressed to the image and likeness of God.\"[134]\n\nOn 20 January 2003, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin declared \"we believe that military intervention would be the worst solution\".[136] Meanwhile, anti-war groups across the world organized public protests. According to French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the war in Iraq, with demonstrations on 15 February 2003 being the largest.[137] Nelson Mandela voiced his opposition in late January, stating \"All that (Mr. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil,\" and questioning if Bush deliberately undermined the U.N. \"because the secretary-general of the United Nations [was] a black man\".[138]\n\nIn February 2003, the US Army's top general, Eric Shinseki, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it would take \"several hundred thousand soldiers\" to secure Iraq.[139] Two days later, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the post-war troop commitment would be less than the number of troops required to win the war, and that \"the idea that it would take several hundred thousand US forces is far from the mark.\" Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Shinseki's estimate was \"way off the mark,\" because other countries would take part in an occupying force.[140]\n\nGermany's Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer, although having been in favor of stationing German troops in Afghanistan, advised Federal Chancellor Schröder not to join the war in Iraq. Fischer famously confronted United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the 39th Munich Security Conference in 2003 on the secretary's purported evidence for Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction: \"Excuse me, I am not convinced!\"[141] Fischer also cautioned the United States against assuming that democracy would easily take root post-invasion; \"You're going to have to occupy Iraq for years and years, the idea that democracy will suddenly blossom is something that I can't share. … Are Americans ready for this?\"[142]\n\nIn July 2003, former U.S. ambassador Joseph C. Wilson published an op-ed challenging the Bush administration's claim that Iraq sought uranium from Niger, a key justification for the war. In apparent retaliation, officials leaked the identity of Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, an undercover CIA officer, exposing her covert status. The resulting investigation led to the conviction of Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, for perjury and obstruction of justice, and his sentence was commuted by President Bush.[143]\n\nThere were serious legal questions surrounding the launching of the war against Iraq and the Bush Doctrine of preemptive war in general. On 16 September 2004, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, said of the invasion \"...was not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the Charter point of view, it was illegal.\"[144]\n\nCourse of the war\n\nThe first Central Intelligence Agency team entered Iraq on 10 July 2002.[145] This team was composed of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the US military's elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC).[146] Together, they prepared for an invasion by conventional forces. These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and identifying all the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions.[146]\n\nMost importantly, their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to become the northern front of the invasion. Together this force defeated Ansar al-Islam in Iraqi Kurdistan before the invasion and then defeated the Iraqi army in the north.[146][147] The battle against Ansar al-Islam, known as Operation Viking Hammer, led to the death of a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat.[145][148]\n\nAt 5:34 am Baghdad time on 20 March 2003[149] (9:34 pm, 19 March EST) the surprise[150] military invasion of Iraq began. There was no declaration of war.[151] The 2003 invasion of Iraq was led by US Army General Tommy Franks, under the code-name Operation Iraqi Freedom,[152] the UK code-name Operation Telic, and the Australian code-name Operation Falconer. Coalition forces also cooperated with Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north. Approximately forty other governments, the \"Coalition of the Willing\", participated by providing troops, equipment, services, security, and special forces, with 248,000 soldiers from the United States, 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers and 194 Polish soldiers from Special Forces unit GROM sent to Kuwait for the invasion.[153] The invasion force was also supported by Iraqi Kurdish militia troops, estimated to number upwards of 70,000.[154]\n\nAccording to General Franks, there were eight objectives of the invasion:\n\nThe invasion was a quick and decisive operation encountering major resistance, though not what the US, British and other forces expected. The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular, asymmetric warfare at the same time, conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces, largely armored, but launching smaller-scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed in civilian and paramilitary clothes.\n\nCoalition troops launched air and amphibious assaults on the al-Faw Peninsula to secure the oil fields there and the important ports, supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy. The United States Marine Corps' 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, attached to 3 Commando Brigade and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM, attacked the port of Umm Qasr, while the British Army's 16 Air Assault Brigade secured the oil fields in southern Iraq.[156][157]\n\nThe heavy armor of the US 3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force moved more easterly along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and 1 (UK) Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland.[158] The American 1st Marine Division fought through Nasiriyah in a battle to seize the major road junction.[159] The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around Talil Airfield.[160]\n\nWith the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured in its rear, the 3rd Infantry Division supported by the 101st Airborne Division continued its attack north toward Najaf and Karbala, but a severe sand storm slowed the coalition advance and there was a halt to consolidate and make sure the supply lines were secure.[161] When they started again they secured the Karbala Gap, a key approach to Baghdad, then secured the bridges over the Euphrates River, and US Army forces poured through the gap on to Baghdad. In the middle of Iraq, the 1st Marine Division fought its way to the eastern side of Baghdad and prepared for the attack to seize the city.[162]\n\nOn 9 April, Baghdad fell, ending Saddam's 24‑year rule. US forces seized the deserted Ba'ath Party ministries and, according to some reports later disputed by the Marines on the ground, stage-managed[163] the tearing down of a huge iron statue of Saddam, photos and video of which became symbolic of the event, although later controversial. Allegedly, though not seen in the photos or heard on the videos, shot with a zoom lens, was the chant of the inflamed crowd for Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric.[164] The abrupt fall of Baghdad was accompanied by a widespread outpouring of gratitude toward the invaders, but also massive civil disorder, including the looting of public and government buildings and drastically increased crime.[165][166]\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, 250,000 short tons (230,000 t) (of 650,000 short tons (590,000 t) total) of ordnance was looted, providing a significant source of ammunition for the Iraqi insurgency. The invasion phase concluded when Tikrit, Saddam's home town, fell with little resistance to the US Marines of Task Force Tripoli on 15 April.\n\nIn the invasion phase of the war (19 March – 30 April), an estimated 9,200 Iraqi combatants were killed by coalition forces along with an estimated 3,750 non-combatants, i.e. civilians who did not take up arms.[167] Coalition forces reported the death in combat of 139 US military personnel[168] and 33 UK military personnel.[169]\n\nWidespread looting and low-level criminal activity gripped the country in April 2003. By that point it was clear that there were not enough US forces to control the breakdown of order in the country and little plan to restore it.[170][171]\n\nOn 1 May 2003, President Bush visited the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln operating a few miles west of San Diego, California and declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. At sunset, he held his nationally televised \"Mission Accomplished\" speech, delivered before the sailors and airmen on the flight deck.[100] Ambassador Paul Bremer arrived in Iraq on May 12, 2003 and established the Coalition Provisional Authority. One of his first actions was to initiate the debaathification process.[170]\n\nNevertheless, Saddam Hussein remained at large, and significant pockets of resistance remained. After Bush's speech, coalition forces noticed a flurry of attacks on its troops began to gradually increase in various regions, such as the \"Sunni Triangle\".[172][173] Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of a large anti-American faction in Baghdad's Sadr City, issued a fatwa allowing his followers to partake in the looting provided a portion of their takings were gifted to the Sadrist Movement.[171]\n\nThe initial Iraqi insurgents were supplied by hundreds of weapons caches created before the invasion by the Iraqi army and Republican Guard.[citation needed]\n\nShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA; Arabic: سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة), based in the Green Zone, as a transitional government of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government. Citing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (22 May 2003) and the laws of war, the CPA vested itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.\n\nThe CPA was originally headed by Jay Garner, a former US military officer, but his appointment lasted only until 11 May 2003, when President Bush appointed L. Paul Bremer. On 16 May 2003, his first day on the job, Paul Bremer issued Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1 to exclude from the new Iraqi government and administration members of the Baathist party. This policy, known as De-Ba'athification, eventually led to the removal of 85,000 to 100,000 Iraqi people from their jobs,[174] including 40,000 school teachers who had joined the Baath Party simply to stay employed. US army general Ricardo Sanchez called the decision a \"catastrophic failure\".[175] Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in June 2004.\n\nIn May 2003, the US Advisor to Iraq Ministry of Defense within the CPA, Walter B. Slocombe, advocated changing the pre-war Bush policy to employ the former Iraq Army after hostilities on the ground ceased.[176] At the time, hundreds of thousands of former Iraq soldiers who had not been paid for months were waiting for the CPA to hire them back to work to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Despite advice from US Military Staff working within the CPA, Bremer met with President Bush, via video conference, and asked for authority to change the US policy. Bush gave Bremer and Slocombe authority to change the pre-war policy. Slocombe announced the policy change in the Spring of 2003. The decision led to the alienation of hundreds of thousands of former armed Iraq soldiers, who subsequently aligned themselves with various occupation resistance movements all over Iraq. In the week before the order to dissolve the Iraq Army, no coalition forces were killed by hostile action in Iraq; the week after, five US soldiers were killed. Then, on 18 June 2003, coalition forces opened fire on former Iraq soldiers protesting in Baghdad who were throwing rocks at coalition forces. The policy to disband the Iraq Army was reversed by the CPA only days after it was implemented. But it was too late; the former Iraq Army shifted their alliance from one that was ready and willing to work with the CPA to one of armed resistance against the CPA and the coalition forces.[177]\n\nAnother group created by the multinational force in Iraq post-invasion was the 1,400-member international Iraq Survey Group, who conducted a fact-finding mission to find Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs. In 2004, the ISG's Duelfer Report stated that Iraq did not have a viable WMD program.[178][179][180][181][182][183]\n\nCoalition military forces launched several operations around the Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. In late 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the \"Ramadan Offensive\", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe fall of 2003 saw major attacks at the Jordanian Embassy and the bombing of UN Headquarters in Baghdad in which Sérgio Vieira de Mello was killed.[170] The three governorates with the highest number of attacks were Baghdad, Al Anbar, and Saladin. Those three governorates account for 35% of the population, but by December 2006 they were responsible for 73% of US military deaths and an even higher percentage of recent US military deaths (about 80%).[184]\n\nTo counter this offensive, coalition forces began to use air power and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion, by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents was stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam's birthplace of al-Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma, were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, the multinational forces focused on capturing the remaining leaders of the former government. On 22 July, a raid by the US 101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20 killed Saddam's sons (Uday and Qusay) along with one of his grandsons. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.\n\nMost significantly, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003, on a farm near Tikrit in Operation Red Dawn.[185] The operation was conducted by the United States Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121. Intelligence on Saddam's whereabouts came from his family members and former bodyguards.[186]\n\nWith the capture of Saddam and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded that multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country, and the United States promised over $20 billion in reconstruction money in the form of a credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.\n\nShortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an Iraqi Interim Government. Most prominent among these was the Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time.[187] The insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad (Sadr City) to Basra in the south.\n\nFollowing the United States' invasion of Iraq in 2003, large numbers of antiquities including the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet were stolen, both from museums, such as the Iraq National Museum, but also because of illegal excavations at archeological sites throughout the country. Many of them were smuggled into the United States through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, contrary to federal law. Donald Rumsfeld rejected the claim that they were removed by US military personnel. In the 2020s, about 17,000 artifacts were returned to Iraq from the U.S. and Middle Eastern countries. But according to an Iraqi archeology professor at the University of Baghdad, the repatriation of these items was only a partial success; the Baghdad office of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) continues to search for the loot worldwide. Many Iraqis blame the United States for the loss of so many pieces of their country's history.[188][189]\n\nThe start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. However, violence did increase during the Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004 with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, an al-Qaeda-linked group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, helping to drive the insurgency.[190] An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was gaining power throughout Iraq.[citation needed] As the violence intensified in March, there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings. In the bloodiest day of the war since the start of combat operations, hundreds of Shi'a were killed when five bombs exploded on March 2 during Ashoura celebrations.[170]\n\nThe most serious fighting of the war so far began on 31 March 2004, when Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a Blackwater USA convoy led by four US private military contractors who were providing security for food caterers Eurest Support Services.[191] The four armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Subsequently, their bodies were dragged from their vehicles by local people, beaten, set ablaze, and their burned and mutilated corpses hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates.[192] Photos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and moral outrage in the United States, and prompting an unsuccessful \"pacification\" of the city: the First Battle of Fallujah in April 2004.\n\nFollowers of the Shi'a mullah Muqtada al-Sadr known as the Mahdi militia paraded through multiple cities. In April 2004, the Shi'a demonstators began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive. Several Coalition troops died in Sadr City and Najaf. These clashes lasted until June 2004.[170]\n\nIn June 2004, the CPA formally transferred sovereignty to the Iraqi government, headed by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi.[170] Allawi opposed the hasty de-baathification that would destabilize the political structure of the Iraqi government.[171] His secular rule of law agenda was unsuccessful as \"instritutionalized sectarianism\" developed in the escalating conflict with Muqtada al-Sadr in Najaf and Sunni radicals in Fallujah.[193]\n\nIn one of the most significant single attacks of the war 49 newly trained Iraqi soldiers were executed by insurgents wearing police uniforms on 23 October 2004. Analysts note this supports the view that Iraqi police forces and Interior Ministry had been compromised by insurgents. Allawi blamed the attack on Coalition forces.[170]\n\nThe offensive in Fallujah was resumed in November 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the war: the Second Battle of Fallujah, described by the US military as \"the heaviest urban combat (that they had been involved in) since the Battle of Hue City in Vietnam.\"[194] During the assault, US forces used white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against insurgent personnel, attracting controversy. The 46‑day battle resulted in a victory for the coalition, with 95 US soldiers killed along with approximately 1,350 insurgents. Fallujah was totally devastated during the fighting, though civilian casualties were low, as they had mostly fled before the battle.[195]\n\nAnother major event of that year was the revelation of widespread prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, which received international media attention in April 2004. First reports of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, as well as graphic pictures showing US military personnel taunting and abusing Iraqi prisoners, came to public attention from a 60 Minutes II news report (28 April) and a Seymour M. Hersh article in The New Yorker (posted online on 30 April).[196] Military correspondent Thomas Ricks claimed that these revelations dealt a blow to the moral justifications for the occupation in the eyes of many people, especially Iraqis, and was a turning point in the war.[197]\n\n2004 also marked the beginning of Military Transition Teams in Iraq, which were teams of US military advisors assigned directly to New Iraqi Army units.\n\nOn 31 January, Iraqis elected the Iraqi Transitional Government in order to draft a permanent constitution. Although some violence and a widespread Sunni boycott marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 US troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month.[198] February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.\n\nThe Battle of Abu Ghraib on 2 April 2005 was an attack on United States forces at Abu Ghraib prison, which consisted of heavy mortar and rocket fire, under which an estimated 80–120 armed insurgents attacked with grenades, small arms, and two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). The US force's munitions ran so low that orders to fix bayonets were given in preparation for hand-to-hand fighting. It was considered to be the largest coordinated assault on a US base since the Vietnam War.[199]\n\nHopes for a quick end to the insurgency and a withdrawal of US troops were dashed in May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 US soldiers.\n\nThe summer of 2005 saw fighting around Baghdad and at Tall Afar in northwestern Iraq as US forces tried to seal off the Syrian border. This led to fighting in the autumn in the small towns of the Euphrates valley between the capital and that border.[200]\n\nA referendum was held on 15 October in which the new Iraqi constitution was ratified. An Iraqi National Assembly was elected in December, with participation from the Sunnis as well as the Kurds and Shia.[200]\n\nInsurgent attacks increased in 2005 with 34,131 recorded incidents, compared to a total 26,496 for the previous year.[201]\n\nThe beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.\n\nAlthough no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days. Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on 23 February, and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed. In the aftermath of this attack, the US military calculated that the average homicide rate in Baghdad tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day. In 2006 the UN described the environment in Iraq as a \"civil war-like situation\".[202]\n\nOn 12 March, five United States Army soldiers of the 502nd Infantry Regiment raped the 14-year-old Iraqi girl Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi, and then murdered her, her father, her mother Fakhriya Taha Muhasen, and her six-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza al-Janabi. The soldiers then set fire to the girl's body to conceal evidence of the crime.[203] Four of the soldiers were convicted of rape and murder and the fifth was convicted of lesser crimes for their involvement in the events, which became known as the Mahmudiyah rape and killings.[204][205]\n\nOn 6 June 2006, the United States was successful in tracking Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who was killed in a targeted killing, while attending a meeting in an isolated safehouse approximately 8 km (5.0 mi) north of Baqubah. Having been tracked by a British UAV, radio contact was made between the controller and two United States Air Force F-16C jets, which identified the house and at 14:15 GMT, the lead jet dropped two 500‑pound (230 kg) guided bombs, a laser-guided GBU‑12 and GPS-guided GBU‑38 on the building where he was located. Six others – three male and three female individuals – were also reported killed. Among those killed were one of his wives and their child.\n\nThe government of Iraq took office on 20 May 2006, following approval by the members of the Iraqi National Assembly. This followed the general election in December 2005. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government, which had continued in office in a caretaker capacity until the formation of the permanent government.\n\nThe Iraq Study Group Report was released on 6 December 2006. The Iraq Study Group made up of people from both of the major US parties, was led by co-chairs James Baker, a former Secretary of State (Republican), and Lee H. Hamilton, a former US Representative (Democrat). It concluded that \"the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating\" and \"US forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end.\" The report's 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with Iran and Syria and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On 18 December, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 attacks per week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005.[206]\n\nCoalition forces formally transferred control of a governorate to the Iraqi government, the first since the war. Military prosecutors charged eight US Marines with the murders of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in November 2005, 10 of them women and children. Four officers were also charged with dereliction of duty in relation to the event.[207]\n\nSaddam Hussein was hanged on 30 December 2006, after being found guilty of crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court after a year-long trial.[208]\n\nOn 10 January 2007, in a televised address to the US public, Bush proposed 21,500 more troops for Iraq, a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs.[209] On 23 January 2007, in the 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush announced he was \"deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq\". On 10 February 2007, David Petraeus was made commander of Multi-National Force – Iraq (MNF-I), the four-star post that oversees all coalition forces in the country, replacing General George Casey. In his new position, Petraeus oversaw all coalition forces in Iraq and employed them in the new \"Surge\" strategy outlined by the Bush administration.[210][211]\n\nOn 10 May 2007, 144 Iraqi Parliamentary lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal.[212] On 3 June 2007, the Iraqi Parliament voted 85 to 59 to require the Iraqi government to consult with Parliament before requesting additional extensions of the UN Security Council Mandate for Coalition operations in Iraq.[213]\n\nPressures on US troops were compounded by the continuing withdrawal of coalition forces.[214] In early 2007, British Prime Minister Blair announced that following Operation Sinbad, British troops would begin to withdraw from Basra Governorate, handing security over to the Iraqis.[214] In July Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen also announced the withdrawal of 441 Danish troops from Iraq, leaving only a unit of nine soldiers manning four observational helicopters.[215] In October 2019, the new Danish government said it would not re-open an official probe into the country's participation in the US-led military coalition in 2003 Iraqi war.[216]\n\nIn a speech made to Congress on 10 September 2007, Petraeus \"envisioned the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 US troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent [in September].\"[217] On 13 September, Bush announced a limited withdrawal of troops from Iraq:[218][219]\n\nBush said 5,700 personnel would be home by Christmas 2007, and expected thousands more to return by July 2008. The plan would take troop numbers back to their level before the surge at the beginning of 2007.\n\nEffects of the surge on security\n\nBy March 2008, violence in Iraq was reportedly curtailed by 40–80%, according to a Pentagon report.[220] Independent reports[221][222] raised questions about those assessments. An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad, down from 1,440 in the four previous weeks. The New York Times counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28‑day period, based on initial daily reports from Iraqi Interior Ministry and hospital officials.\n\nHistorically, the daily counts tallied by The New York Times underestimated the total death toll by 50% or more when compared to studies by the United Nations, which rely upon figures from the Iraqi Health Ministry and morgue figures.[223]\n\nThe rate of US combat deaths in Baghdad nearly doubled to 3.14 per day in the first seven weeks of the \"surge\" in security activity, compared to the previous period. Across the rest of Iraq, it decreased slightly.[224][225]\n\nOn 14 August 2007, the deadliest single attack of the whole war occurred. Nearly 800 civilians were killed by a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks on the northern Iraqi settlement of Kahtaniya. More than 100 homes and shops were destroyed in the blasts. US officials blamed al‑Qaeda. The targeted villagers belonged to the non-Muslim Yazidi ethnic minority. The attack may have represented the latest in a feud that erupted earlier that year when members of the Yazidi community stoned to death a teenage girl called Du'a Khalil Aswad accused of dating a Sunni Arab man and converting to Islam. The killing of the girl was recorded on camera-mobiles and the video was uploaded onto the internet.[226][227][228][229]\n\nOn 13 September 2007, Abdul Sattar Abu Risha was killed in a bomb attack in the city of Ramadi.[230] He was an important US ally because he led the \"Anbar Awakening\", an alliance of Sunni Arab tribes that opposed al-Qaeda. The latter organization claimed responsibility for the attack.[231] A statement posted on the Internet by the shadowy Islamic State of Iraq called Abu Risha \"one of the dogs of Bush\" and described Thursday's killing as a \"heroic operation that took over a month to prepare\".[232]\n\nThere was a reported trend of decreasing US troop deaths after May 2007, and violence against coalition troops had fallen to the \"lowest levels since the first year of the American invasion\".[233] These, and several other positive developments, were attributed to the surge by many analysts.[234]\n\nData from the Pentagon and other US agencies such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that daily attacks against civilians in Iraq remained \"about the same\" since February. The GAO also stated that there was no discernible trend in sectarian violence.[235] However, this report ran counter to reports to Congress, which showed a general downward trend in civilian deaths and ethno-sectarian violence since December 2006.[236] By late 2007, as the US troop surge began to wind down, violence in Iraq had begun to decrease from its 2006 highs.[237]\n\nEntire neighborhoods in Baghdad were ethnically cleansed by Shia and Sunni militias and sectarian violence broke out in every Iraqi city where there was a mixed population.[238][239][240] Investigative reporter Bob Woodward cited US government sources according to which the US \"surge\" was not the primary reason for the drop in violence in 2007–08. Instead, according to that view, the reduction of violence was due to newer covert techniques by US military and intelligence officials to find, target, and kill insurgents, including working closely with former insurgents.[241]\n\nIn the Shia region near Basra, British forces turned over security for the region to Iraqi Security Forces. Basra was the ninth governorate of Iraq's 18 governorates to be returned to local security forces' control since the beginning of the occupation.[242]\n\nMore than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country for the first time. 144 of the 275 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition that would require the Iraqi government to seek approval from Parliament before it requests an extension of the UN mandate for foreign forces to be in Iraq, which expires at the end of 2008. It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces. The UN Security Council mandate for US‑led forces in Iraq will terminate \"if requested by the government of Iraq.\"[243] 59% of those polled in the US support a timetable for withdrawal.[244]\n\nIn mid-2007, the Coalition began a controversial program to recruit Iraqi Sunnis (often former insurgents) for the formation of \"Guardian\" militias. These Guardian militias are intended to support and secure various Sunni neighborhoods against the Islamists.[245]\n\nIn 2007, tensions increased greatly between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK). According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since 16 August. These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on 23 August by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants.[246]\n\nCoalition forces also began to target alleged Iranian Quds force operatives in Iraq, either arresting or killing suspected members. The Bush administration and coalition leaders began to publicly state that Iran was supplying weapons, particularly EFP devices, to Iraqi insurgents and militias although to date have failed to provide any proof for these allegations. Further sanctions on Iranian organizations were also announced by the Bush administration in the autumn of 2007. On 21 November 2007, Lieutenant General James Dubik, who is in charge of training Iraqi security forces, praised Iran for its \"contribution to the reduction of violence\" in Iraq by upholding its pledge to stop the flow of weapons, explosives, and training of extremists in Iraq.[247]\n\nBorder incursions by PKK militants based in Northern Iraq have continued to harass Turkish forces, with casualties on both sides. In the fall of 2007, the Turkish military stated their right to cross the Iraqi Kurdistan border in \"hot pursuit\" of PKK militants and began shelling Kurdish areas in Iraq and attacking PKK bases in the Mount Cudi region with aircraft.[248][249] The Turkish parliament approved a resolution permitting the military to pursue the PKK in Iraqi Kurdistan.[250] In November, Turkish gunships attacked parts of northern Iraq in the first such attack by Turkish aircraft since the border tensions escalated.[251] Another series of attacks in mid-December hit PKK targets in the Qandil, Zap, Avashin and Hakurk regions. The latest series of attacks involved at least 50 aircraft and artillery and Kurdish officials reported one civilian killed and two wounded.[252]\n\nAdditionally, weapons that were given to Iraqi security forces by the US military were being recovered by authorities in Turkey after being used by PKK in that state.[253]\n\nOn 17 September 2007, the Iraqi government announced that it was revoking the license of the US security firm Blackwater USA over the firm's involvement in the killing of eight civilians, including a woman and an infant,[254] in a firefight that followed a car bomb explosion near a State Department motorcade.\n\nThroughout 2008, US officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics. According to the US Defense Department, in December 2008 the \"overall level of violence\" in the country had dropped 80% since before the surge began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to prewar levels. They also pointed out that the casualty figure for US forces in 2008 was 314 against a figure of 904 in 2007.[255]\n\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, Iraqi civilian fatalities numbered 490 in November 2008 as against 3,500 in January 2007, whereas attacks against the coalition numbered somewhere between 200 and 300 per week in the latter half of 2008, as opposed to a peak of nearly 1,600 in summer 2007. The number of Iraqi security forces killed was under 100 per month in the second half of 2008, from a high of 200 to 300 in the summer of 2007.[256]\n\nMeanwhile, the proficiency of the Iraqi military increased as it launched a spring offensive against Shia militias, which Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had previously been criticized for allowing to operate. This began with a March operation against the Mahdi Army in Basra, which led to fighting in Shia areas up and down the country, especially in the Sadr City district of Baghdad. By October, the British officer in charge of Basra said that since the operation, the town had become \"secure\" and had a murder rate comparable to Manchester in England.[257] The US military also said there had been a decrease of about a quarter in the quantity of Iranian-made explosives found in Iraq in 2008, possibly indicating a change in Iranian policy.[258]\n\nProgress in Sunni areas continued after members of the Awakening movement were transferred from US military to Iraqi control.[259] In May, the Iraqi army – backed by coalition support – launched an offensive in Mosul, the last major Iraqi stronghold of al-Qaeda. Despite detaining thousands of individuals, the offensive failed to lead to major long-term security improvements in Mosul. At the end of the year, the city remained a major flashpoint.[260][261]\n\nIn the regional dimension, the ongoing conflict between Turkey and PKK[262][263][264] intensified on 21 February, when Turkey launched a ground attack into the Quandeel Mountains of Northern Iraq. In the nine-day-long operation, around 10,000 Turkish troops advanced up to 25 km into Northern Iraq. This was the first substantial ground incursion by Turkish forces since 1995.[265][266]\n\nShortly after the incursion began, both the Iraqi cabinet and the Kurdistan regional government condemned Turkey's actions and called for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region.[267] Turkish troops withdrew on 29 February.[268] The fate of the Kurds and the future of the ethnically diverse city of Kirkuk remained a contentious issue in Iraqi politics.\n\nUS military officials met these trends with cautious optimism as they approached what they described as the \"transition\" embodied in the US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, which was negotiated throughout 2008.[255] The commander of the coalition, US General Raymond T. Odierno, noted that \"in military terms, transitions are the most dangerous time\" in December 2008.[255]\n\nAt the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed \"Charge of the Knights\", in Basra to secure the area from militias. This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops. The offensive was opposed by the Mahdi Army, one of the militias, which controlled much of the region.[269][270] Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including Sadr City, Al Kut, Al Hillah and others. During the fighting Iraqi forces met stiff resistance from militiamen in Basra to the point that the Iraqi military offensive slowed to a crawl, with the high attrition rates finally forcing the Sadrists to the negotiating table.\n\nFollowing intercession by the Iranian government, al‑Sadr ordered a ceasefire on 30 March 2008.[271] The militiamen kept their weapons.\n\nBy 12 May 2008, Basra \"residents overwhelmingly reported a substantial improvement in their everyday lives\" according to The New York Times. \"Government forces have now taken over Islamic militants' headquarters and halted the death squads and 'vice enforcers' who attacked women, Christians, musicians, alcohol sellers and anyone suspected of collaborating with Westerners\", according to the report; however, when asked how long it would take for lawlessness to resume if the Iraqi army left, one resident replied, \"one day\".[270]\n\nIn late April roadside bombings continued to rise from a low in January – from 114 bombings to more than 250, surpassing the May 2007 high.\n\nSpeaking before Congress on 8 April 2008, General David Petraeus urged delaying troop withdrawals, saying, \"I've repeatedly noted that we haven't turned any corners, we haven't seen any lights at the end of the tunnel,\" referencing the comments of then-President Bush and former Vietnam-era General William Westmoreland.[272] When asked by the Senate if reasonable people could disagree on the way forward, Petraeus said, \"We fight for the right of people to have other opinions.\"[273]\n\nUpon questioning by then Senate committee chair Joe Biden, Ambassador Crocker admitted that Al‑Qaeda in Iraq was less important than the Al Qaeda organization led by Osama bin Laden along the Afghan-Pakistani border.[274] Lawmakers from both parties complained that US taxpayers are carrying Iraq's burden as it earns billions of dollars in oil revenues.\n\nIraq became one of the top purchasers of US military equipment with their army trading its AK‑47 assault rifles for the US M‑16 and M‑4 rifles, among other equipment.[275] In 2008 alone, Iraq accounted for more than $12.5 billion of the $34 billion US weapon sales to foreign countries (not including the potential F-16 fighter planes.).[276]\n\nIraq sought 36 F‑16s, the most sophisticated weapons system Iraq has attempted to purchase. The Pentagon notified Congress that it had approved the sale of 24 American attack helicopters to Iraq, valued at as much as $2.4 billion. Including the helicopters, Iraq announced plans to purchase at least $10 billion in US tanks and armored vehicles, transport planes, and other battlefield equipment and services. Over the summer, the Defense Department announced that the Iraqi government wanted to order more than 400 armored vehicles and other equipment worth up to $3 billion, and six C-130J transport planes, worth up to $1.5 billion.[277][278] From 2005 to 2008, the United States had completed approximately $20 billion in arms sales agreements with Iraq.[279]\n\nThe US–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement was approved by the Iraqi government on 4 December 2008.[280] It established that US combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by 30 June 2009, and that all US forces would be completely out of Iraq by 31 December 2011. The pact was subject to possible negotiations which could have delayed withdrawal and a referendum scheduled for mid-2009 in Iraq, which might have required all US forces to completely leave by the middle of 2010.[281][282] The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that are not related to combat.[283]\n\nUS contractors working for US forces were to be subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other US agencies may retain their immunity. If US forces commit still undecided \"major premeditated felonies\" while off-duty and off-base, they will be subject to the still undecided procedures laid out by a joint US‑Iraq committee if the United States certifies the forces were off-duty.[284][285][286][287]\n\nSome Americans have discussed \"loopholes\"[288] and some Iraqis have said they believe parts of the pact remain a \"mystery\".[289] US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates predicted that after 2011 he expected to see \"perhaps several tens of thousands of American troops\" as part of a residual force in Iraq.[290]\n\nSeveral groups of Iraqis protested the passing of the SOFA accord[291][292][293] as prolonging and legitimizing the occupation. Tens of thousands of Iraqis burned an effigy of George W. Bush in a central Baghdad square where US troops five years previously organized a tearing down of a statue of Saddam Hussein.[163][289][294] Some Iraqis expressed skeptical optimism that the US would completely end its presence by 2011.[295] On 4 December 2008, Iraq's presidential council approved the security pact.[280]\n\nA representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Husseini al‑Sistani expressed concern with the ratified version of the pact and noted that the government of Iraq has no authority to control the transfer of occupier forces into and out of Iraq, no control of shipments and that the pact grants the occupiers immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts. He said that Iraqi rule in the country is not complete while the occupiers are present, but that ultimately the Iraqi people would judge the pact in a referendum.[294] Thousands of Iraqis have gathered weekly after Friday prayers and shouted anti‑US and anti-Israeli slogans protesting the security pact between Baghdad and Washington. A protester said that despite the approval of the Interim Security pact, the Iraqi people would break it in a referendum next year.[296]\n\nOn 1 January 2009, the United States handed control of the Green Zone and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose 1 January be declared national \"Sovereignty Day\". \"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status\", al‑Maliki said.[297]\n\nThe US military attributed a decline in reported civilian deaths to several factors including the US‑led \"troop surge\", the growth of US-funded Awakening Councils, and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's call for his militia to abide by a cease fire.[298]\n\nOn 31 January, Iraq held provincial elections.[299] Provincial candidates and those close to them faced some political assassinations and attempted assassinations, and there was also some other violence related to the election.[300][301][302][303]\n\nIraqi voter turnout failed to meet the original expectations which were set and was the lowest on record in Iraq,[304] but US Ambassador Ryan Crocker characterized the turnout as \"large\".[305] Of those who turned out to vote, some groups complained of disenfranchisement and fraud.[304][306][307] After the post-election curfew was lifted, some groups made threats about what would happen if they were unhappy with the results.[308]\n\nOn 27 February, United States President Barack Obama gave a speech at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in the US state of North Carolina announcing that the US combat mission in Iraq would end by 31 August 2010. A \"transitional force\" of up to 50,000 troops tasked with training the Iraqi Security Forces, conducting counterterrorism operations, and providing general support may remain until the end of 2011, the president added. However, the insurgency in 2011 and the rise of ISIL in 2014 caused the war to continue.[309]\n\nThe day before Obama's speech, Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al‑Maliki said at a press conference that the government of Iraq had \"no worries\" over the impending departure of US forces and expressed confidence in the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces and police to maintain order without US military support.[310]\n\nOn 9 April, the 6th anniversary of Baghdad's fall to coalition forces, tens of thousands of Iraqis thronged Baghdad to mark the anniversary and demand the immediate departure of coalition forces. The crowds of Iraqis stretched from the Sadr City slum in northeast Baghdad to the square around 5 km (3.1 mi) away, where protesters burned an effigy featuring the face of US President George W. Bush.[311] There were also Sunni Muslims in the crowd. Police said many Sunnis, including prominent leaders such as a founding sheikh from the Sons of Iraq, took part.[312]\n\nOn 30 April, the United Kingdom formally ended combat operations. Prime Minister Gordon Brown characterized the operation in Iraq as a \"success story\" because of UK troops' efforts. Britain handed control of Basra to the United States Armed Forces.[313]\n\nThe withdrawal of US forces began at the end of June, with 38 bases to be handed over to Iraqi forces. On 29 June 2009, US forces withdrew from Baghdad. On 30 November 2009, Iraqi Interior Ministry officials reported that the civilian death toll in Iraq fell to its lowest level in November since the 2003 invasion.[314]\n\nOn 28 July, Australia withdrew its combat forces as the Australian military presence in Iraq ended, per an agreement with the Iraqi government.\n\nOn 30 June and 11 December 2009, the Iraqi ministry of oil awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields. The winning oil companies entered joint ventures with the Iraqi ministry of oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts included extraction of oil for a fixed fee of approximately $1.40 per barrel.[315][316][317] The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached.\n\n2010: US drawdown and Operation New Dawn\n\nOn 17 February 2010, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that as of 1 September, the name \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" would be replaced by \"Operation New Dawn\".[318]\n\nOn 18 April, US and Iraqi forces killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq in a joint American and Iraqi operation near Tikrit, Iraq.[319] The coalition forces believed al-Masri to be wearing a suicide vest and proceeded cautiously. After the lengthy exchange of fire and bombing of the house, the Iraqi troops stormed inside and found two women still alive, one of whom was al-Masri's wife, and four dead men, identified as al-Masri, Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi, an assistant to al-Masri, and al-Baghdadi's son. A suicide vest was indeed found on al-Masri's corpse, as the Iraqi Army subsequently stated.[320] Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced the killings of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri at a news conference in Baghdad and showed reporters photographs of their bloody corpses. \"The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house, and also through the use of missiles,\" Maliki said. \"During the operation computers were seized with e-mails and messages to the two biggest terrorists, Osama bin Laden and [his deputy] Ayman al-Zawahiri\", Maliki added. US forces commander Gen. Raymond Odierno praised the operation. \"The death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al‑Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency\", he said. \"There is still work to do but this is a significant step forward in ridding Iraq of terrorists.\"\n\nUS Vice President Joe Biden stated that the deaths of the top two al‑Qaeda figures in Iraq are \"potentially devastating\" blows to the terror network there and proof that Iraqi security forces are gaining ground.[321]\n\nOn 20 June, Iraq's Central Bank was bombed in an attack that left 15 people dead and brought much of downtown Baghdad to a standstill. The attack was claimed to have been carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq. This attack was followed by another attack on Iraq's Bank of Trade building that killed 26 and wounded 52 people.[322]\n\nIn late August 2010, insurgents conducted a major attack with at least 12 car bombs simultaneously detonating from Mosul to Basra and killing at least 51. These attacks coincided with the US plans for a withdrawal of combat troops.[323]\n\nFrom the end of August 2010, the United States attempted to dramatically cut its combat role in Iraq, with the withdrawal of all US ground forces designated for active combat operations. The last US combat brigades departed Iraq in the early morning of 19 August. Convoys of US troops had been moving out of Iraq to Kuwait for several days, and NBC News broadcast live from Iraq as the last convoy crossed the border. While all combat brigades left the country, an additional 50,000 personnel (including Advise and Assist Brigades) remained in the country to provide support for the Iraqi military.[324][325] These troops were required to leave Iraq by 31 December 2011 under an agreement between the US and Iraqi governments.[326]\n\nThe desire to step back from an active counter-insurgency role did not however mean that the Advise and Assist Brigades and other remaining US forces would not be caught up in combat. A standards memo from the Associated Press reiterated \"combat in Iraq is not over, and we should not uncritically repeat suggestions that it is, even if they come from senior officials\".[327]\n\nState Department spokesman P. J. Crowley stated \"... we are not ending our work in Iraq, We have a long-term commitment to Iraq.\"[328] On 31 August, from the Oval Office, Barack Obama announced his intent to end the combat mission in Iraq. In his address, he covered the role of the United States' soft power, the effect the war had on the United States economy, and the legacy of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.[329]\n\nOn the same day in Iraq, at a ceremony at one of Saddam Hussein's former residences at Al-Faw Palace in Baghdad, a number of US dignitaries spoke in a ceremony for television cameras, avoiding overtones of the triumphalism present in US announcements made earlier in the war. Vice President Joe Biden expressed concerns regarding the ongoing lack of progress in forming a new Iraqi government, saying of the Iraqi people that \"they expect a government that reflects the results of the votes they cast\". Gen. Ray Odierno stated that the new era \"in no way signals the end of our commitment to the people of Iraq\". Speaking in Ramadi earlier in the day, Gates said that US forces \"have accomplished something really quite extraordinary here, [but] how it all weighs in the balance over time I think remains to be seen\". When asked by reporters if the seven-year war was worth doing, Gates commented that \"It really requires a historian's perspective in terms of what happens here in the long run\". He noted the Iraq War \"will always be clouded by how it began\" regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, \"This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home\".[330] On the same day Gen. Ray Odierno was replaced by Lloyd Austin as Commander of US forces in Iraq.\n\nOn 7 September, two US troops were killed and nine wounded in an incident at an Iraqi military base. The incident is under investigation by Iraqi and US forces, but it is believed that an Iraqi soldier opened fire on US forces.[331]\n\nOn 8 September, the US Army announced the arrival in Iraq of the first specifically designated Advise and Assist Brigade, the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. It was announced that the unit would assume responsibilities in five southern governorates.[332] From 10 to 13 September, Second Advise and Assist Brigade, 25th Infantry Division fought Iraqi insurgents near Diyala.\n\nAccording to reports from Iraq, hundreds of members of the Sunni Awakening Councils may have switched allegiance back to the Iraqi insurgency or al-Qaeda.[333]\n\nIn October, WikiLeaks disclosed 391,832 classified US military documents on the Iraq War.[334][335][336] Approximately, 58 people were killed with another 40 wounded in an attack on the Sayidat al‑Nejat church, a Chaldean Catholic church in Baghdad. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq organization.[337]\n\nCoordinated attacks in primarily Shia areas struck throughout Baghdad on 2 November, killing approximately 113 and wounding 250 with around 17 bombs.[338]\n\nAs US forces departed the country, the Iraq Defense Ministry solidified plans to purchase advanced military equipment from the United States. Plans in 2010 called for $13 billion of purchases, to include 140 M1 Abrams main battle tanks.[339] In addition to the $13 billion purchase, the Iraqis also requested 18 F-16 Fighting Falcons as part of a $4.2 billion program that also included aircraft training and maintenance, AIM‑9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs and reconnaissance equipment.[340] All Abrams tanks were delivered by the end of 2011,[341] but the first F-16s did not arrive in Iraq until 2015, due to concerns that the Islamic State might overrun Balad Air Base.[342]\n\nThe Iraqi Navy also purchased 12 US‑built Swift-class patrol boats, at a cost of $20 million each. Delivery was completed in 2013.[343] The vessels are used to protect the oil terminals at Basra and Khor al-Amiya.[340] Two US‑built offshore support vessels, each costing $70 million, were delivered in 2011.[344]\n\nIn a move to legitimize the existing Iraqi government, the United Nations lifted the Saddam Hussein-era UN restrictions on Iraq. These included allowing Iraq to have a civilian nuclear program, permitting the participation of Iraq in international nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, as well as returning control of Iraq's oil and gas revenue to the government and ending the Oil-for-Food Programme.[345]\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr returned to Iraq in the holy city of Najaf to lead the Sadrist movement after being in exile since 2007.[346]\n\nJune 2011, became the bloodiest month in Iraq for the US military since June 2009, with 15 US soldiers killed, only one of them outside combat.[347]\n\nOn 7 July, two US troops were killed and one seriously injured in an IED attack at Victory Base Complex outside Baghdad. They were members of the 145th Brigade Support Battalion, 116th Cavalry Heavy Brigade Combat Team, an Idaho Army National Guard unit base in Post Falls, Idaho. Spc. Nathan R. Beyers, 24, and Spc. Nicholas W. Newby, 20, were killed in the attack, Staff Sgt. Jazon Rzepa, 30, was seriously injured.[348]\n\nIn September, Iraq signed a contract to buy 18 Lockheed Martin F-16 warplanes, becoming the 26th nation to operate the F-16. Because of windfall profits from oil, the Iraqi government is planning to double this originally planned 18, to 36 F-16s. Iraq is relying on the US military for air support as it rebuilds its forces and battles a stubborn Islamist insurgency.[349]\n\nWith the collapse of the discussions about extending the stay of any US troops beyond 2011, where they would not be granted any immunity from the Iraqi government, on 21 October 2011, President Obama announced at a White House press conference that all remaining US troops and trainers would leave Iraq by the end of the year as previously scheduled, bringing the US mission in Iraq to an end.[350][351][352][353][354][355] The last American soldier to die in Iraq before the withdrawal, SPC. David Hickman, was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad on 14 November.[356]\n\nIn November 2011, the US Senate voted down a resolution to formally end the war by bringing its authorization by Congress to an end.[357]\n\nOn 15 December, an American military ceremony was held in Baghdad putting a formal end to the US mission in Iraq.[358]\n\nThe last US combat troops withdrew from Iraq on 18 December 2011, although the US embassy and consulates continue to maintain a staff of more than 20,000 including 100+ military personnel within the Office of Security Cooperation-Iraq (OSC-I),[359] US Marine Embassy Guards and between 4,000 and 5,000 private military contractors.[360][361] The next day, Iraqi officials issued an arrest warrant for the Sunni Vice-president Tariq al-Hashimi. He has been accused of involvement in assassinations and fled to the Kurdish part of Iraq.[362]\n\nThe invasion and occupation led to sectarian violence, which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians. Since the beginning of the war, the first parliamentary elections were held in 2005 which brought greater representation and autonomy to Iraqi Kurds. By 2007 the Iraqi Red Crescent estimated 2.3 million Iraqis were internally displaced, with an estimated 2 million Iraqis fleeing to neighboring countries, mostly to Syria and Jordan.[363]\n\nSectarian violence continued in the first half of 2013. At least 56 people died in April when a Sunni protest in Hawija was interrupted by a government-supported helicopter raid and a series of violent incidents occurred in May. On 20 May 2013, at least 95 people died in a wave of car bomb attacks that was preceded by a car bombing on 15 May that led to 33 deaths; also, on 18 May 76 people were killed in the Sunni areas of Baghdad. Some experts have stated that Iraq could return to the brutal sectarian conflict of 2006.[364][365]\n\nOn 22 July 2013, at least five hundred convicts, most of whom were senior members of al-Qaida who had received death sentences, were freed from Abu Ghraib jail in an insurgent attack, which began with a suicide bomb attack on the prison gates.[366] James F. Jeffrey, the United States ambassador in Baghdad when the last American troops exited, said the assault and resulting escape \"will provide seasoned leadership and a morale boost to Al Qaeda and its allies in both Iraq and Syria ... it is likely to have an electrifying impact on the Sunni population in Iraq, which has been sitting on the fence.\"[367]\n\nBy mid-2014 Iraq was in chaos with a new government yet to be formed following national elections, and the insurgency reaching new heights. In early June 2014 the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took over the cities of Mosul and Tikrit and said it was ready to march on Baghdad, while Iraqi Kurdish forces took control of key military installations in the major oil city of Kirkuk. The al-Qaida breakaway group formally declared the creation of an Islamic state on 29 June 2014, in the territory under its control.[368]\n\nPrime Minister Nouri al-Maliki unsuccessfully asked his parliament to declare a state of emergency that would give him increased powers.[369] On 14 August 2014, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki succumbed to pressure at home and abroad to step down. This paved the way for Haidar al-Abadi to take over on 19 August 2014.\n\nIn September 2014, President Obama acknowledged that the US underestimated the rise of the Islamic State and overestimated the Iraqi military's ability to fight ISIL.[370] Obama announced the return of US forces, in the form of aerial support, in an effort to halt the advance of ISIL forces, render humanitarian aid to stranded refugees and stabilize the political situation.[371]\n\nA civil war between ISIL and the central government continued for the next three years. Following the election of Donald Trump, the United States intensified its campaign against the Islamic State by January 2017.[372] Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said a tactical shift to surrounding Islamic State strongholds in Mosul, Iraq, and Raqqa, Syria, was devised not only to \"annihilate\" ISIL fighters hunkered down there, but also to prevent them from returning to their home nations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. In 2017, US-backed Kurdish forces captured Raqqa, which had served as the ISIL capital.[373] The Iraqi government declared victory against ISIL in December 2017.[374] By 2018, violence in Iraq was at its lowest level in ten years. This was largely a result of the defeat of ISIL forces and the subsequent calming-down of the insurgency.[375]\n\nIn January 2020, after the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the Iraqi parliament voted for all foreign troops to leave the country. This would end its standing agreement with the United States to station 5,200 soldiers in Iraq. Then-President Trump objected to withdrawing troops and threatened Iraq with sanctions over this decision.[376] In 2023, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani indicated his support for an indefinite U.S. military presence in Iraq.[377]\n\nFor coalition death totals see the infobox at the top right. See also Casualties of the Iraq War, which has casualty numbers for coalition nations, contractors, non-Iraqi civilians, journalists, media helpers, aid workers, and the wounded. Casualty figures, especially Iraqi ones, are highly disputed.\n\nThere have been several attempts by the media, coalition governments and others to estimate the Iraqi casualties. The table below summarizes some of these estimates and methods.\n\nIn 2013, the total cost of the war to date was estimated at $1.7 trillion by the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.[378] However, some economists argue the total cost to the U.S. economy could range from $3[379] to $6 trillion, including long-term interest and veterans' costs, by 2053.[380] The upper ranges of these estimates include the long-term cost of disability compensation and medical care to U.S. troops. Harvard's public finance expert, Linda J. Bilmes, estimated that these costs alone would amount to nearly $1 trillion over the next 40 years.[381] Bilmes also argued the war diverted resources from Afghanistan, raised oil prices, increased US federal debt, and contributed to the global financial crisis.[382] The most recent estimates indicate costs will exceed $2.9 trillion by 2050. This figure includes direct costs such as military operations, veterans' care, and reconstruction, as well as long-term expenses, particularly for veterans' healthcare and disability benefits. As of 2023, $1.8 trillion had been spent, and costs will continue over the coming decades due to care for veterans and other war-related expenditures.[383]\n\nA CNN report noted that the U.S.-led interim government, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), lost track of $8.8 billion from the Development Fund for Iraq during its tenure.[384] Additionally, in 2011, CBS News reported that $6 billion in cash, was airlifted into Iraq by the Bush administration aboard military cargo planes. This was part of a total of $12 billion sent in cash over 21 separate flights by May 2004, much of which disappeared.[385] Stuart Bowen, director of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, stated that the CPA had failed to establish sufficient controls to ensure the funds were used transparently, adding that the missing money might represent \"the largest theft of funds in national history.\"[386]\n\nBy 2013, some human rights groups in both Iraq and the US had begun campaigning for reparations from the US for the devastation and health effects suffered by Iraqis during the war.[387][388]\n\nAs of 2021, Iraq had fallen into an economic depression, caused by the ongoing COVID pandemic and falling oil and gas prices, which economists described as the country's biggest financial threat since the rule of Saddam Hussein. Iraq suffered from currency devaluation in 2021 for the first time in decades and was unable to import crucial products, including medicines and food, and had a lack of foreign currency to pay off the national debt.[389]\n\nAccording to a 2007 Oxfam report, the child malnutrition rate had risen to 28%, and the rate of people without access to clean drinking water had risen to 70%.[390] In 2007, Nasser Muhssin, a researcher on family and children's affairs affiliated to the University of Baghdad claimed that 60–70% of Iraqi children suffered from psychological problems.[391] A 2007 cholera outbreak in northern Iraq was thought to be the result of poor water quality.[392] As many as half of Iraqi doctors left the country between 2003 and 2006.[393]\n\nBy the end of 2015, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 4.4 million Iraqis had been internally displaced.[394] The population of Iraqi Christians dropped dramatically during the war, from 1.5 million in 2003 to 500,000 in 2015,[395] and perhaps only 275,000 in 2016.\n\nThe Foreign Policy Association reported that: \"Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis ... has been the inability for the United States to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country. To date, the United States has granted around 84,000 Iraqis refugee status, of the more than two million global Iraqi refugees. By contrast, the United States granted asylum to more than 100,000 South Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War.\"[396][397][398]\n\nThe war has led to oil spills, which increased carbon emissions and contaminated the surrounding water resources. During the invasion period, the retreating Iraqi army damaged the oil infrastructure and destroyed more than 736 oil wells in southern Iraq, resulting in fires and massive oil spills.[399] In 2003, more than 50 billion tonnes of carbon emissions were produced from burning oil fields.[400] Over 130 million gallons of oil leaked into surrounding water resources, such as Sawa Lake.[401] Between 2003 and 2010, more than 5,000 birds from three species died around Sawa Lake.[401]\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition used depleted uranium (DU) munitions during the war to pierce tank armour.[402] 1,000 to 2,000 tonnes (980 to 1,970 long tons; 1,100 to 2,200 short tons) of DU munitions were fired, which caused ammunition fragments containing radioactive material to spread across the country. According to a United Nations Environment Programme report, radioactive material contaminated air and soil; with the radioactive concentration found in Iraqi soil at 709.52 Bq in 2003 compared to 143.22 Bq in 2002.[403] The report states that high levels of radiation prevented plants, especially crop seeds, from sprouting; with about 22% (9.5 million ha) of the farmland in Iraq unable to grow barley.[401]\n\nIn addition, radiation contamination may have had harmful public health outcomes through poisoning and increased incidence of various cancers and birth defects.[403] Several studies have identified increased occurrence of deformities, cancers, and other serious health problems in areas where DU shells were used.[404] Some Iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long-term effects of depleted uranium.[405] Studies disagree on whether DU ammunition has any measurable detrimental health effects.[406][403] According to research from the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 2005, the cancer rate had increased by 35% since 2003. As of 2013, 140,000 Iraqis were suffering from cancer, with between 7,000 and 8,000 new cases yearly.[403] According to a 2012 journal article by Al-Hadithi et al., existing studies and research evidence does not show a \"clear increase in birth defects\" or a \"clear indication of a possible environmental exposure including depleted uranium\". The article further states that \"there is actually no substantial evidence that genetic defects can arise from parental exposure to DU in any circumstances.\"[407]\n\nThe war has also led to damage to ecosystems though pollution and physical destruction. Approximately 25,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the U.S. military during the war.[399] More than 250 chemical and armament factories were destroyed, which caused over 50,000 cubic meters of hazardous chemicals, such as fertilizer, and raw sewage to leak into water,[408] leading to surrounding freshwater ecosystem becoming polluted and species' habitat being impacted.[399] According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, 33 Iraqi wetlands, especially the Mesopotamian Marshland, have been contaminated by chemicals, which has caused 60 types of mammal species to lose their habitats, and more than 45 types of plants to become extinct.[401]\n\nImpact on the Global War on Terrorism\n\nThough explicitly stating that Iraq had \"nothing\" to do with 9/11 attacks,[409] erstwhile President George W. Bush consistently referred to the Iraq War as \"the central front in the War on Terror\", and argued that if the United States pulled out of Iraq, \"terrorists will follow us here\".[410][411][412] While other proponents of the war regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict dragged on, members of the US Congress, the US public, and even US troops questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti-US terrorism. In particular, a consensus developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq War actually increased terrorism. Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a \"fatal mistake\".[413]\n\nLondon's International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become \"a potent global recruitment pretext\" for Mujahideen and that the invasion \"galvanised\" al-Qaeda and \"perversely inspired insurgent violence\" there.[414] The US National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with \"a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills ... There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will, therefore, disperse to various other countries.\" The council's chairman Robert Hutchings said, \"At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.\"[415] And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 US intelligence agencies, held that \"The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause célèbre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.\"[416]\n\nA report by the Council on Foreign Relations, released on the 20th anniversary of the invasion analyzed the rationale to go to war and the subsequent decisions during the occupation. The report states that the \"justification for going to war was based on scanty and deeply flawed intelligence\" and that the invasion was an \"error compounded by the absence of an agreed exit strategy and the decision to embark on a massive, open-ended nation-building project\". The same report also ascertained that \"the occupation authority's first acts were to disband the Iraqi army and the Ba'athist governing party, igniting what would become a lethal, long-running insurgency and eventually a multinational terrorist organization that took over most of the country\".[417][100]\n\nFrom a geopolitical perspective, the war in Iraq has been interpreted as weakening the West's moral high ground and hampering its ability to effectively counter Russia and China. With regard to the Russo-Ukrainian War, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said in March 2022 that the U.S. exerted similar pressures on Iraq in 2003, which the US invaded later for no reason other than \"a vial of unidentified chemicals\".[418] In March 2023, Tony Blair, former British prime minister rejected comparisons between Russia's war in Ukraine and the US-led invasion of Iraq, claiming that the Iraq War cannot be used as a justification by Russia to annex Russian-speaking zones in eastern Ukraine.[419]\n\nThe Bush administration's rationale for the Iraq War has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States,[421][422][353] with many US citizens finding many parallels with the Vietnam War.[423] For example, a former CIA officer described the Office of Special Plans as a group of ideologues who were dangerous to US national security and a threat to world peace, and stated that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam.[424] The Center for Public Integrity stated that the Bush administration made a total of 935 false statements between 2001 and 2003 about Iraq's alleged threat to the United States.[425]\n\nBoth proponents and opponents of the invasion have also criticized the prosecution of the war effort along with a number of other lines. Most significantly, critics have assailed the United States and its allies for not devoting enough troops to the mission, not adequately planning for post-invasion Iraq, and for permitting and perpetrating human rights abuses. As the war has progressed, critics have also railed against the high human and financial costs. In 2016, the United Kingdom published the Iraq Inquiry, a public inquiry which was broadly critical of the actions of the British government and military in making the case for the war, in tactics and in planning for the aftermath of the war.[426][427][428]\n• Punishment of dissenters leading up to the war\n• Human rights violations such as the Iraq prison abuse scandals\n• Insufficient post-invasion plans, in particular inadequate troop levels (A RAND Corporation study stated that 500,000 troops would be required for success.) 438\n• Financial costs with approximately spent as of 4/09 the CBO has estimated the total cost of the war in Iraq to the United States will be around . 439\n• Damage to US' traditional alliances and influence in the region. 442 443\n• Endangerment and ethnic cleansing of religious and ethnic minorities by insurgents 239 444 445 446 447\n• Disruption of Iraqi oil production and related energy security concerns (the price of oil quadrupled between 2002 and 2008). 448 449\n\nThroughout the war, many human rights abuses and war crimes were committed.\n• Deaths of civilians as a result of bombing and missile strikes that fail to take feasible precautions with regards to civilians casualties. 450\n• Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse by US Army personnel, 451 involving the detention of thousands of Iraqi people. Torture at Abu Ghraib included rape, sodomy and extensive sexual abuse, waterboarding, pouring phosphoric acid on detainees, sleep deprivation and physical beatings.\n• Haditha massacre of 24 civilians by US soldiers.\n• Widespread use of the incendiary munition white phosphorus such as during the battle of Fallujah. The documentary Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre, claimed that Iraqi civilians, including women and children, had died of burns caused by white phosphorus during the battle, however, US Department of Defense spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable denied that this was true but confirmed to the BBC that US forces had used white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon there against enemy combatants. 452 453 454 The use of white phosphorus against civilian populations is banned by international legislation. 455\n• Mahmudiyah rape and killings, where US soldiers raped and killed 14-year old Abeer Qasim Humza. They also killed 3 of her relatives. 456 457\n• The torture and killing of prisoner of war, Iraqi Air Force commander, Abed Hamed Mowhoush.\n• The killing of Baha Mousa while in British Army custody.\n• Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre, where 42 civilians were allegedly killed by coalition airstrikes. 458\n• Planting weapons on noncombatant, unarmed Iraqis by three US Marines after killing them. 459 460 According to a report by The Nation, other similar acts have been witnessed by US soldiers. 461\n• Allegations of beatings, electrocution, mock executions, and sexual assault by British troops were presented to the International Criminal Court (ICC) by Public Interest Lawyers (PIL) and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) on 12 January 2014. 462\n• Killing over 12,000 Iraqis from January 2005 to June 2006, according to Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Jabr, giving the first official count for the victims of bombings, ambushes and other deadly attacks. 463 The insurgents have also conducted numerous suicide attacks on the Iraqi civilian population, mostly targeting the majority Shia community. 464 465 An October 2005 report from Human Rights Watch examines the range of civilian attacks and their purported justification. 466\n• Attacks against civilians by sectarian death squads primarily during the Iraqi Civil War. Iraq Body Count project data shows that 33% of civilian deaths during the Iraq War resulted from execution after abduction or capture. These were overwhelmingly carried out by unknown actors including insurgents, sectarian militias and criminals. 467\n• Attacks on diplomats and diplomatic facilities including; the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 killing the top UN representative in Iraq and 21 other UN staff members; 468 beheading several diplomats: two Algerian diplomatic envoys Ali Belaroussi and Azzedine Belkadi, 469 Egyptian diplomatic envoy al-Sherif, 470 and four Russian diplomats 471\n• The February 2006 bombing of the al-Askari Mosque, destroying one of the holiest Shiite shrines, killing over 165 worshipers and igniting sectarian strife and reprisal killings 472\n• The publicised killing of several contractors; Eugene Armstrong, Jack Hensley, Kenneth Bigley, Ivaylo Kepov and Georgi Lazov (Bulgarian truck drivers.) 473 Other non-military personnel murdered include: translator Kim Sun-il, Shosei Koda, Fabrizio Quattrocchi (Italian), charity worker Margaret Hassan, reconstruction engineer Nick Berg, photographer Salvatore Santoro (Italian) 474 and supply worker Seif Adnan Kanaan (Iraqi.) Four private armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire, their bodies dragged from their vehicles, beaten and set ablaze. Their burned corpses were then dragged through the streets before being hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates. 475\n• Torture or killing of members of the New Iraqi Army, 476 and assassination of civilians associated with the Coalition Provisional Authority, such as Fern Holland, or the Iraqi Governing Council, such as Aqila al-Hashimi and Ezzedine Salim, or other foreign civilians, such as those from Kenya 477\n\nThe post-invasion Iraqi government used torture against detainees, including children. Some techniques of torture used included beatings, electric shocks, prolonged hanging by the wrists, food and water deprivation, and blindfolding for multiple days.[478] Iraqi police from the Interior Ministry were accused of forming Death Squads and committing numerous massacres of Sunni Arabs.[479] Many of these human rights abuses were carried out by Iraqi government-sponsored Shi'ite militias.[480]\n\nIn a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq.[481] In a March 2003 YouGov poll, 54% of Britons supported the military action against Iraq.[482] A remarkable aspect was the support for invasion expressed by many left-wing intellectuals such as Christopher Hitchens, Paul Berman, Michael Walzer and Jean Bethke Elshtain.[483][484] In a February 2003 poll by the national public research institute CIS, 91% of Spaniards opposed any military intervention in Iraq.[485]\n\nAccording to a January 2007 BBC World Service poll of more than 26,000 people in 25 countries, 73% of the global population disapproved of US handling of the Iraq War.[486] A September 2007 poll conducted by the BBC found that two-thirds of the world's population believed the US should withdraw its forces from Iraq.[487]\n\nIn 2006 it was found that majorities in the UK and Canada believed that the war in Iraq was \"unjustified\" and – in the UK – were critical of their government's support of US policies in Iraq.[488]\n\nAccording to polls conducted by the Arab American Institute, four years after the invasion of Iraq, 83% of Egyptians had a negative view of the US role in Iraq; 68% of Saudi Arabians had a negative view; 96% of the Jordanian population had a negative view; 70% of the population of the United Arab Emirates and 76% of the Lebanese population also described their view as negative.[489] The Pew Global Attitudes Project reports that in 2006 majorities in the Netherlands, Germany, Jordan, France, Lebanon, Russia, China, Canada, Poland, Pakistan, Spain, Indonesia, Turkey, and Morocco believed the world was safer before the Iraq War and the toppling of Saddam, while pluralities in the United States and India believe the world is safer without Saddam Hussein.[490]\n\nDirectly after the invasion, an NDTV poll of Baghdad residents reported a slight majority of respondents supported the US invasion.[491] Polls conducted between 2005 and 2007 showed 31–37% of Iraqis wanted US and other Coalition forces to withdraw once security was restored and that 26–35% wanted immediate withdrawal instead.[492][493][494] In 2006, a poll conducted on the Iraqi public revealed that 52% of the ones polled said Iraq was going in the right direction and 61% claimed it was worth ousting Saddam Hussein.[492] In a March 2007 BBC poll, 82% of Iraqis expressed a lack of confidence in coalition forces based in Iraq.[495] According to a 2009 poll conducted by the University of Maryland, 7 out of 10 Iraqis wanted US troops to withdraw within one year and also 78% felt that US military presence was \"provoking more conflict than it is preventing\".[496] Despite a majority having previously been opposed to the US presence, according to a poll conducted by the Asharq Research Centre, a private Iraqi company, 60% of Iraqis had believed it was \"the wrong time\" for a major withdrawal of American troops prior to the withdrawal in 2011, with 51% saying withdrawal would have a negative effect.[497][498]\n\nAccording to studies, most of the suicide bombers in Iraq were foreigners, especially Saudis.[499][500][501]\n\nAccording to two unnamed US officials, the Pentagon is examining the possibility that the Karbala provincial headquarters raid, in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five US soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians. In a speech on 31 January 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq[502] and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Quds Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by US forces in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on 11 January.[503][504] In 2014, the legacy of Iran's presence in Iraq after the invasion had been mixed with regard to the fight against regional terrorist groups. The U.S. occupation and subsequent regional instability had spawned the creation of the PMF (Popular Mobilization Forces), an Iranian militia that effectively fought the influence of emerging caliphates in the region.[505]\n\nLater, a 1,300-page US Army Iraq War study, released in January 2019, concluded that \"At the time of this project's completion in 2018, an emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor\" and that the outcome of the war triggered a \"deep skepticism about foreign interventions\" among America's public opinion.[433]\n\nThe invasion of Iraq prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.[515] Before and during the invasion of Iraq, the Russian government provided intelligence to Saddam Hussein about the location of US forces and their plans.[516]\n• National Network to End the War Against Iraq\n• None Bellavia, David (2007).

eleccions presidencials dels Estats Units, la batalla entre Kamala Harris i Donald Trump no només divideix els votants, sinó també moltes cares conegudes. Aquí t’expliquem qui està amb qui.\n\nA l’equip de Kamala Harris, trobem una llarga llista de personatges de la música i el cinema. Taylor Swift va fer públic el seu suport molt al principi i de seguida la van acompanyar noms com Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, John Legend, Bruce Springsteen, Cardi B i Bad Bunny. Pel que fa a Beyoncé, a més de donar suport a Harris, també ha permès l’ús de la seva cançó “Freedom” en la campanya de Harris.\n\nA més d’artistes a la llista de suport també hi figuren actors com George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston, Ben Stiller i Robert De Niro, i l’expresident Barack Obama i la seva dona, Michelle Obama.\n\nPer altra banda, Trump compta amb el suport d’alguns cantants de reggaeton com Anuel AA, Justin Quiles i Ncky Jam. Tot i que amb aquest últim es va equivocar tractant-lo en femení i referint-se a ell dient: ‘Està bona’.\n\nTambé el recolzen estrelles de Hollywood com Jon Voight i Dennis Quaid. Entre els empresaris i multimilionaris que s’han posicionat al seu favor hi trobem figures com Elon Musk.Marabeth Quin Art Classes: For anyone that has ever felt like they just can't make color theory second nature or intuitive, this class is for you!

Archaeological finds show that ore was excavated here 3,000 years ago, and the area's mountains held the world's greatest deposits of copper, lead, and zinc. Today, the mine—closed since 1988—and its surroundings form one of the most impressive historic mining areas in the world.\n\nIn December 1992, the former Rammelsberg Mine and the old town of Goslar were included in UNESCO's World Heritage List. The site spotlights more than ten centuries of mining history and a large inventory of mining monuments: the Rathstiefste gallery (12th century), the oldest brick mine in Europe (13th century), and the Roeder tunnels (18th/19th c.), with original waterwheels.\n\nHuge waterwheels—like this ancient, technical masterpiece in the Roeder adit—helped miners lift the ore from the depths of the mountain and drive pumps. – © Stefan Sobotta\n\nSome 30 million tons of ore mined here in Rammelberg have shaped the history of the city of Goslar. The mine's wealth, at the beginning of the 11th century, led to the establishment of the Palatinate by Emperor Henry II. In the year 1009, the first imperial assembly took place in Goslar. Goslar was the residence of German kings and emperors until 1253.\n\nGerman history has been written at the Imperial Palace in Goslar for over 200 years at numerous imperial assemblies. – © Stefan Schiefer / GOSLAR marketing gmbh\n\nIn 2010, UNESCO decided designation should be extended to the Upper Harz water managment system, a masterpiece of early mining and engineering. It provided the energy supply for the industry from the Middle Ages to the industrial age. Over the centuries, a unique and ingenious waterway system was created, consisting of kilometres of ditches, artificial ponds, and underground waterways. The system was instrumental in the technical innovation of mining throughout Europe.\n\nThe Upper Harz Water System is a unique structure of dams, reservoirs, and ditches that supplied hydropower and fuelled mining in the Harz for 800 years. – © German National Tourism Board\n\nHow to Get There\n\nThe Goslar railway station is served by trains from Göttingen, Hanover, Braunschweig, and Halle/Saale every hour. From the station, you can reach Rammelsberg in 30 minutes with the bus line 803, direction \"Bergbaumusem.\" The bus stop is located directly at the station.\n\nBy car, take Highway A7 and then exit B82, direction Goslar. From Highway A395 (via Braunschweig or Wernigerode), take the B6 exit to Goslar's centre. Federal road B241 connects Clausthal-Zellerfeld to Goslar.\n\nRammelsberg Mines, Goslar Old Town, and Upper Harz Water System is a year-round destination. During the holiday season, please make a telephone reservation due to the large number of visitors. Underground guided-tour group sizes are limited to 25 participants.\n\nUnderground visits are only possible through guided tours. The mine train and tours through the Roeder tunnels take place every 30 minutes daily and require no prior notice.\n\nThe underground portion of the site keeps a constant temperature of 12°C and it drips in places. Please wear sturdy and appropriate shoes. There are no age restrictions for guided tours, but we recommend a minimum age of four years old."}

Container used to contain live fish or crustaceans underwater\n\nA corf (pl. corves) also spelt corve (pl. corves) is a container of wood, net, chicken wire, metal or plastic used to contain live fish, eels or crustaceans (such as crayfish) underwater, at docks or in fishing boats.[1][2]\n\n1350–1400; Middle English from Dutch and German Korb, ultimately borrowed from Latin corbis basket;[3] cf. corbeil\n\nCorves were originally crucial to keep captured fish fresh until the boat with the catch reached its harbor.[4] A corf could be towed behind the boat while fishermen made the journey from the fishing grounds to the fish market. These journeys could last up to half a day.[5] When used for storing eels in Blekinge, Sweden, the corves could be as large as 3.75 by 1.33 by 0.8 m (12 ft 3+5⁄8 in by 4 ft 4+3⁄8 in by 2 ft 7+1⁄2 in) and contain about 2 metric tons (2.2 short tons; 2.0 long tons) of eels. They would be anchored approximately 100 m (330 ft) from land in an area where the water circulation was good to keep the eels alive.[6] Smaller corves were often used in fishing boats to keep live bait for longline fishing.[4]\n\nThe corf could also be built into the boat, and sometimes be a significant part of it.[4] Fishing boats with a well amidships where water is circulated through small holes in the hull are known as well smacks.[7][8]\n\nIn present days corves used for this purpose have commonly been replaced by refrigeration and freezing.[9]\n\nA corf-house is a small building or shed constructed for commercial curing of fish, mostly salmon, in. It is also used to store nets and fishing equipment in.[3] One such house is the listed By Lovat Bridge Corf House in Beauly, Scotland.[10]\n\nCorves are mainly used by recreational fishermen and mass-produced in plastic netting or metal.[11][12] Their use is regulated through laws and regulations in some countries such as Sweden,[13][14][15] and Australia.[16]\n\nModern fishing boats often have integral corves. These are built into the boat and the water in them kept fresh and oxygenated through a circulatory system with water and air pumps. This kind of corf is called a livewell.[17][18]\n• The dictionary definition of corf at WiktionaryNCBI - WWW Error Blocked Diagnostic: Your access to the NCBI website at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has been temporarily blocked due to a possible misuse/abuse situation involving your site.

Now with a new look!Reddit - Dive into anything: I know ovals are Indycars heritage, the sport was born on Ovals but I'll admit I'm not really a fan of them. My dad grew up in the 60s and 70s when the sport was almost all ovals, save for the occasional road race and he's one of those old guys who always goes on about \"Indycar needs more ovals, I would watch again if their were more ovals!\" and of course the few ovals that due exist on the schedule he never watches (save for the 500). I've meet a bunch of other older guys like him and say similar things but yet they never watch...\n\nBut me, the only Indy race I have ever attended was the St. Pete Grand Prix. and ever time I went it was a lot of fun. I guess I cut my teeth on the grand prix and have always found the street course/road racers to be more fun. I'm also an American Formula 1 fan and want Indycar to become more like Formula 1. If I had it my way the only oval would be the 500.Improving drawing of ovals and circles: Stack Exchange network consists of 183 Q&A communities including Stack Overflow, the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers."}
