Some schools claim to be the only legitimate heir of the art, but ninjutsu is not centralized like modernized martial arts such as judo or karate. Togakure-ryū claims to be the oldest recorded form of ninjutsu and to have survived past the 16th century.\n\nSpying in Japan dates as far back as Prince Shōtoku (572–622). According to Shōninki, the first open usage of ninjutsu during a military campaign was in the Genpei War, when Minamoto no Kuro Yoshitsune chose warriors to serve as shinobi(ninja) during a battle. This manuscript goes on to say that during the Kenmu era, Kusunoki Masashige frequently used ninjutsu. According to footnotes in this manuscript, the Genpei War lasted from 1180 to 1185, and the Kenmu Restoration occurred between 1333 and 1336.[4][page needed] Ninjutsu proper was most likely developed during the Nanboku-cho period, used by samurai fighting on both sides of the conflict, and was further refined after the Onin War and throughout the Sengoku period, where many rising samurai warlords used ninja to gather intelligence and commit secret raids on their enemies. In the chaos following the Onin War, jizamurai from the Kōka and the Iga Province began to engage in guerrilla warfare in order to protect their lands from bandits, rogue yamabushi, and larger samurai forces. The jizamurai that lived in Kōka and Iga were self-sufficient and did not answer to the shugo governors of their lands, in which the local samurai of both regions operated as de facto independent confederacies – the Kōka and Iga ikki – and formed an alliance together which persisted until the conquest of Kōka by Oda Nobunaga in 1574 and the conquest of Iga in 1581.\n\nThroughout history, the shinobi were assassins, scouts, and spies who were hired mostly by territorial lords known as daimyō. Despite being able to assassinate in stealth, the primary role was as spies and scouts. Shinobi are mainly noted for their use of stealth and deception. They would use this to avoid direct confrontation if possible, which enabled them to escape large groups of opposition.\n\nMany different schools (ryū) have taught their unique versions of ninjutsu. An example of this is the Togakure-ryū, which claims to have been developed after a defeated samurai warrior called Daisuke Togakure escaped to the region of Iga. He later came in contact with the warrior-monk Kain Doshi, who taught him a new way of viewing life and the means of survival (ninjutsu).[2]: 18–21\n\nNinjutsu was developed as a collection of fundamental survivalist techniques in the warring state of feudal Japan. The ninja used their art to ensure their survival in a time of violent political turmoil. Ninjutsu included methods of gathering information and techniques of non-detection, avoidance, and misdirection. Ninjutsu involved training in disguise, escape, concealment, archery, and medicine. Skills relating to espionage and assassination were highly useful to warring factions in feudal Japan. At some point, the skills of espionage became known collectively as shinobi no jutsu, and the people who specialized in these tasks were called shinobi no mono.\n\nToday, the last authentic heir of ninjutsu is Jinichi Kawakami, the 21st head of the Koga Ban family, honorary director of the Ninja Museum of Igaryu, and professor at Mie University, specializing in the research of ninjutsu.[5][6] In 2012, Kawakami chose to be the end of his line of ninjutsu, stating that the art has no practical place in the modern age.[7]\n• None Bertrand, John (2006). \"Techniques that made ninjas feared in 15th-century Japan still set the standard for covert ops\".

ISBN .\n• Ninjutsu techniques – ninjutsu kata and techniques in the AKBAN wiki\n• Ninjutsu history – history of Ninjutsu and its evolutionNinjutsu: Ninjutsu (忍術, English TV: Ninja Art, literally meaning: Ninja Techniques) is one of the three main jutsu categories. Ninjutsu is the most nebulous of the three, and may most simply be described as anything that is not genjutsu or taijutsu. Most ninjutsu require chakra and hand seals, but this is not always the case since the mere usage of weaponry qualifies as ninjutsu. The huge range of ninjutsu's uses is illustrated by its several sub-classifications: medical ninjutsu, reincarnation ninjutsu, space–time ninjutsu, barrier ninjutsu, sealing jutsu, cursed seal jutsu and sensory ninjutsu.\n\nMost ninjutsu use shape transformation, which deals with controlling the form and movement of the ninjutsu, while nature transformation deals with changing the ninjutsu's physical properties. Ninjutsu that use nature transformation tend to follow a naming convention of their nature type followed by a more specific name. With practice and experience, certain ninjutsu can become second nature to a ninja, allowing them to perform it at will.\n\nNinjutsu is humans' corrupted use of the Sage of Six Paths' ninshū originally created by his son, Indra;[1] rather than use chakra to achieve understanding and create peace as the Sage intended, humans weaponised their chakra for war. Over time, shinobi came to believe that Hagoromo was the inventor of the ninjutsu rather than his eldest son.\n• The simultaneous use of ninjutsu and taijutsu is called \"nintaijutsu\".\n• Jin no Sho describes Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken as \"the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time\".[2]\n• Amado considers ninjutsu as attempts to reproduce the effects of the Ōtsutsuki Clan's shinjutsu.\n• Kinshiki says the chakra pills are desired because they allow the user to perform supernatural or divine acts.[3]Ninjutsu | AKBAN: At its core, Ninjutsu (忍術, נינג'יטסו)is a skill set and, nowadays, a martial art that emphasizes resourcefulness, fighting spirit, and practical gains rather than glory.\n\nAlthough the Ninja figure is often shrouded in myth, the AKBAN academy's Ninjutsu course is grounded in historically documented techniques and principles that have been pressure tested for effectiveness. We approach Ninjutsu as a comprehensive system that cultivates physical fitness, mental resilience, and emotional balance, transcending mere combat skills.\n\nNinjutsu originated in feudal Japan as a comprehensive skill set closely aligned with guerrilla warfare, counterintelligence, and the clandestine lifestyle of the Ninja warrior. Historical Shinobi were hidden in plain sight and more complex operators than just shadowy figures. Ninjutsu techniques have been preserved in various Samurai martial arts, such as Katory Shinto Ryu.\n\nThe AKBAN academy respects the diverse teaching lineages that have contributed to Ninjutsu, including the Bujinkan school, which has been a significant part of our heritage. Bujinkan encompasses nine different martial systems, including the Togakure system that focuses on Ninjutsu. While the Togakure system has a rich history, it lacks formal recognition, as martial arts lineages can vary depending on accrediting organizations and their criteria.\n\nPeeling back the layers of myth, some trace the origins of Ninjutsu to mountain-dwelling ascetics known as Yamabushi. These ascetics were practicing Shugendō, a Japanese religious practice that integrates self-preservation, non-detection, outdoor survival techniques and religious practices. In AKBAN, we see these historical and spiritual roots not as mere myths, but as integral aspects of our practice today.\n\nWhile it's tempting to romanticize the role of Ninjutsu practitioners in feudal Japan, the truth is, much of what we know is based on fragmented historical records and educated guesses. We approach this history with a critical eye. What can be deducted is that these operators likely had a pragmatic approach. Then, like today, operators needed much more than military skills but also a nuanced understanding of human psychology, geography, and even rudimentary chemistry.\n\nNinjutsu encompasses a wide range of techniques, from unarmed combat to proficiency in various weapons. However, the art extends beyond physical maneuvers, incorporating an understanding of human psychology, emotion, and the environment. At the AKBAN academy, these principles are structured into the Methodical Pyramid, a framework for teaching combat skills, resilience, and emotional regulation. This holistic approach reflects the depth of Ninjutsu while adapting to the challenges of modern life.\n\nAlthough techniques in Ninjutsu may vary depending on the school, core principles remain consistent: strikes, throws, armlocks, and weapon techniques. However, the physical moves are only part of the equation; mindset is equally important. At the AKBAN academy, we emphasize \"goals, not glory,\" advocating for minimal aggression whenever possible (link to ethical code). This aligns with the covert warrior ethos, where the objective is to achieve the mission with as little conflict as necessary while striving to do good when possible.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is the importance of community trust and communication. Historically, ninjas operated in close-knit groups, often outside of conventional military structures, requiring a high level of trust and effective communication. We uphold these principles in our modern practice.\n\nFurthermore, we aim to maintain the legendary adaptability of the ninja to new technologies, particularly in this age of rapid technological advancement. From the mythic diving apparatus and poison bombs of the past to the utilization of modern tools and even artificial intelligence, we believe in staying ahead of the curve.

More generally, history as a reconstruction of events as they occurred is essentially an attempt to spirit away their real, inherent contingency. Sometimes, however, we stumble upon accounts of an event, a document, or a passage in a historical text, that undeniably opens the door to an alternative outcome, a juncture where history might have taken a different course over decades, centuries, or even millennia. This kind of potential history is a treasure trove for fiction writers because it gives them the freedom to craft the historical peripetia of their story at will. What if Nazi Germany had won the war in Europe or Hitler had died in 1936? Although neither scenario came close to realization, they have been a source of inspiration for writers and filmmakers. Let’s explore another hypothetical scenario, one on a seemingly smaller scale that feels more realistic: What if Japan had been opened peacefully by British merchants in the late 18th or early 19th century, rather than by American military force in 1854? To assess the likelihood of this alternative outcome, we need to identify a relevant event or document that encapsulates its potential. What might that have been?\n\nThe British merchant navy made numerous aggressive attempts to open Japanese ports during the late Edo period (1600–1863), as has been extensively documented. These efforts caused exasperation for the Japanese government and fear for its subjects.\n\nTake, for example, Captain Pellew’s 1808 raid into Nagasaki Bay with the Phaeton disguised as a Dutch ship. The Napoleonic Wars had wiped the Netherlands off the maps of Europe, replacing it with the imposed, short-lived Batavian Republic. For more than a decade, the fan-shaped artificial island of Dejima, a virtual prison in the harbor of Nagasaki, heavily guarded by Japanese gatekeepers, was the last and only patch of ground where the Dutch flag was still flown. First, Pellew took hostage the Dutch delegates who had credulously boarded the ship. Then he demanded the surrender of the entire Dutch delegation and the island. The Dutch inhabitants of Dejima, after years of complete isolation from their homeland and surviving only on secret supplies of food from sympathetic Japanese natives, were in poor health and in terrible shape. But the brave Hendrik Doeff, head of their delegation and factory director, stood firm against this violation and appealed to the Japanese authorities for help. They immediately closed off the entire bay with all available vessels, from the sampan, small and fast rowing boats, to the huge, lumbering Chinese junks. In this situation, there was a risk that the Phaeton would be set on fire and burn down. Pellew had to give up.\n\nHe reached a face-saving compromise to have his supplies of food, water, and wood replenished. Then he had to withdraw from the shore. This event sent political shockwaves throughout the country to the bakufu, the military „tent government” of the shogun in Edo (now Tokyo), which had to face the evidence of its vulnerability. After all, the military dictatorship of the shogunate derived its legitimacy from the protection of the Empire of Japan against all foreign civilian or military forces, collectively referred to as „the barbarians”. The commissioner of the port of Nagasaki was forced to commit suicide along with seven of his subordinates. In anticipation of future incidents, a massive iron chain was laid secretly across the entire bay, just below the surface of the water.\n\nThis was neither the first nor the last time that British merchants attempted to break the iron grip of the Tokugawa’s sakoku policy of total isolation. By 1854, there had been a total of eight unsuccessful expeditions, some of them just as nasty as the one above. The Japanese government combined these experiences with information about British colonialism in China and India, leading to a terrible perception of the British as the most egregious of intruders. Was such a deterioration of British foreign policy toward Japan necessary? Japan was indeed a low priority for the Crown. It is also clear that the official attempts to open-up the country diplomatically for trade relations were lukewarm, at best. But there was a desire to make a breakthrough. The repeated failures of merchant naval powers, especially the East India Company, were a major blow to the Empire’s pride and could have inspired greater efforts.\n\nIn reality, the opening of Japan was within reach and could have been accomplished quickly. The accidental discovery of a stunning document in 1985 by Hayashi Nozomu and Izumi Tytler opened the door to an alternative history of foreign relations between Britain and Japan. It even had the potential to thwart the fabricated „opening of Japan“ by U.S. naval forces in 1854, which proved disastrous (more on this topic in the second part of my essay series, Rethinking the History of Japan). In 1990, Derek Massarella provided a detailed account of this find, calling it „one of the most interesting archival discoveries“ (The Japonian Charters. The English and Dutch Shuinjō, Monumenta Nipponica 2/1990, Vol. 45, pp. 189–205).\n\nWhat kind of document could have changed centuries of history and the fate of the Japanese nation? Nozomu and Tytler discovered a well-preserved handscroll of thick creped Japanese paper in a long, narrow box at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. They experienced a mixture of amazement and disbelief as they perused it. The document clearly outlined the trading privileges that all Japanese authorities were to grant to the British East India Company. Signed by shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu himself in 1613, the document’s vermilion seal conferred immediate legal authority. It is one of the original two copies of the shuinjō 朱印状, the Japonian charter governing trade with England, that John Saris, commander of the Company’s Eighth Voyage, had received from Ieyasu. The privileges exceeded those previously granted to the Dutch in 1609 and were much greater than those Admiral Perry had extorted from the bakufu in the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854.\n\nThese privileges were later restricted by the Japanese and neglected by the English, but they have never been revoked. How could they since they were granted by the deified founder of the dynasty! But why didn’t the British use this document in their various attempts to open up Japan in the first half of the 19th century? It is well known that neither the English authorities nor the trading companies were careful with legal documents. In this case, the British East India Company is to blame for being so careless as to inadvertently place the shuinjō in the section for Chinese documents because the librarians could not identify its contents as Japanese. So the answer to why Britain didn’t resume exercising the privileges it had been granted is simply that the Japonian charter was lost in the libraries and forgotten.\n\nCould such a document really have influenced the course of history? Massarella is skeptical. He reminds us that after the English left Japan in 1623 due to commercial failure, a new English expedition was sent in 1671. Its leaders hoped to convince the bakufu with a translated and shortened transcript of the original shuinjō. The Japanese authorities, of course, were unimpressed. „Yet even had the English brought the original shuinjō with them […] they would still not have been readmitted to trade in Japan.”\n\nMassarella argues that the Dutch, alarmed at the prospect of English competition, informed the Japanese that Charles II, King of England, was married to the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza, descendant of Japan’s Catholic archenemy in Europe. A little later, he mentions another earlier move by the Dutch to heal souring relations with the Japanese, the forced removal from Hirado to Dejima in 1641 and the severe restrictions that governed the delegation’s life on the island. To this end, they presented their own original shuinjō. „The Dutch hoped that a document bearing the revered Ieyasu’s seal would command the same respect and obedience as if it were his voice speaking from beyond the grave.” The attempt failed. Japanese officials „were genuinely impressed with the care that the Dutch had shown in preserving such a hallowed document […] but, while listening, they turned a deaf ear to the Dutch demands.”\n\nWould it really have been the case that this unique document of a once living God would have been condemned to total powerlessness and insignificance in the face of history? I believe that this assessment is profoundly wrong. Massarella supported his argument by referring to the earliest period of Tokugawa rule. The first shoguns of this dynasty, especially Tokugawa Iemitsu (1623–1651), were absolute monarchs with extremely strong personalities. They would have had no problem, coming almost naturally to them, to challenge the written will of Ieyasu. How different in the late Edo period! It is inconceivable that the bakufu under the much weaker Ienari (1786–1837) or Ieyoshi (1837–1853) — the whole Tokugawa system of policed public order and absurd economic rules had become unpopular, bigoted, and outdated — would have treated an original shuinjō of Ieyasu’s as their early predecessors had.\n\nBut how does one prove this supposition, which stands in complete contradiction to Massarella’s conclusion? With an eyewitness account from someone whose expertise in the field is unquestioned. And who could that be? None other than Philipp Franz von Siebold, the German physician, explorer, “Humboldt of the East,” hero of my true historical fiction novel, and certainly one of the fathers of Japan’s own modernity.\n\nDuring his stay on Dejima between 1823 and 1830 in the service of the Dutch Ministry of Colonies, he established a small university and taught his Japanese students a wide range of the latest Western sciences. Many of these fifty or so people later laid the foundation for Japan’s modernization, which was based not on mathematics and physics as in Europe, but on medicine. Back in Europe, Siebold introduced Japan to European societies in many ways. Fully aware of the plans of some Western nations to open Japan by military force, he fought tirelessly for a peaceful opening of Japan. It was in this political atmosphere, in 1851, that the librarian Thomas Rundall showed him a facsimile of the 1616 translation of the shuinjō, which was kept in the library of the British Museum. Siebold, well aware of Britain’s previous aggressive attempts to open up Japan, was simply furious to see the golden opportunity so clearly documented that England had missed. In a lone and completely overlooked document of only 34 pages, written in German and published in 1854 at the author’s expense under a terribly obscure title, Siebold expressed his utter frustration with American and especially English aggression toward Japan. After enumerating England’s fruitless incursions and tentative invasions of Japan, and then pointing to the existence of an old Japonian charter, the original of which must be somewhere in England, he clearly stated:\n\n“The Japanese government has become more suspicious than ever. For England, this dubious behavior is all the more prejudicial, as her subjects who traded with Japan in the years between 1613 and 1618 were favored with privileges similar to those of the Dutch by the same shogun, the deified Ieyasu, whose laws and edicts are irrevocable. Such ancient charters would make a deeper impression on the Japanese government and pave the way for a friendlier reception than a certain letter of recommendation in the Morning Chronicle (October 20, 1846), which tried to win over Japanese hearts and minds by emphasizing the English preponderance in the balance of world domination”.\n\nSiebold was deeply convinced that the way Japan had been forced to end its seclusion was all wrong. And he was right. The arrival of Admiral Perry’s Black Ships marked the beginning of a tragic and disastrous aberration in Japanese history, leading to a complete militarization of society and a fatal imitation of the colonialist patterns learned from Europe and the U.S. From his early years in Nagasaki until his death in 1866, Siebold worked for the alternative solution, a progressive opening of the country through fair trade on equal terms and an exchange of culture and science. He failed dramatically in his time, but today we should give him credit for being above reproach with his liberal beliefs and cosmopolitan ideals."}

Often referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\", she is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Spears has sold over 150 million records worldwide, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, 15 Guinness World Records, six MTV Video Music Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards (including the Millennium Award), the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her heavily choreographed music videos earned her the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\nAfter appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with Jive Records in 1997 at age fifteen. Her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), are among the best-selling albums of all time and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of over 1.3 million copies, Oops!... I Did It Again held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for fifteen years. Spears adopted a more mature and provocative style for her albums Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and starred in the 2002 film Crossroads. She was executive producer of her fifth studio album, Blackout (2007), often referred to as her best work.[2] Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a conservatorship.\n\nSubsequently, Spears released the chart-topping albums Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, Spears became the second artist in history to debut at number one with two or more songs on the Billboard Hot 100. She embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016). In 2019, Spears' legal battle over her conservatorship became more publicized and led to the establishment of the #FreeBritney movement.[3] In 2021, the conservatorship was terminated following her public testimony in which she accused her management team and family of abuse.[4] Spears published her first memoir, The Woman in Me, in 2023, which became a number-one New York Times best-seller in its first week of release.[5]\n\nIn the United States, Spears is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era,[6] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[7][8][9] She was ranked by Billboard as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s.[10] Spears has had six number-one albums on the Billboard 200[11] and five number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", \"Hold It Against Me\", and \"S&M (Remix)\". Other hit singles include \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", \"Toxic\", \"Gimme More\", and \"Piece of Me\". \"...Baby One More Time\" was named the greatest debut single of all time by Rolling Stone in 2020. In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded $1.5 billion as of 2012 .[12] Forbes listed Spears as the world's highest-paid female musician in 2001 and 2012.[13][14] By 2012, she had topped Yahoo!'s list of most searched celebrities seven times in twelve years.[15] Time named Spears one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2021. Spears placed first in the Time reader poll.[16][17]\n\nBritney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981, in McComb, Mississippi,[18] the second child of James \"Jamie\" Parnell Spears and Lynne Irene Bridges.[19] Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English and born in London, and one of Spears' maternal great-grandfathers was Maltese.[20] Her siblings are Bryan James Spears and Jamie Lynn Spears.[21]\n\nBorn in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence,[22] she was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[23] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[24] On August 5, 2021, Spears announced that she had converted to Catholicism. Her mother, sister, and nieces Maddie Aldridge and Ivey Joan Watson, are also Catholic.[25] However, on September 5, 2022, after Spears' ex-husband, Kevin Federline, and youngest son did an interview defending her father's actions during her conservatorship, she stated: \"I don't believe in God anymore because of the way my children and my family have treated me. There is nothing to believe in anymore. I'm an atheist y'all\".[26]\n\nAt age three, Spears began attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Aged five she made her local stage debut, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[27][28][29] In gymnastics, Spears attended Béla Károlyi's training camp.[30] She said of her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, ... I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[28]\n\nWhen Spears was eight, she and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears' singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School.[31]\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the off-Broadway musical Ruthless! She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[32][33] In December 1992, she was cast in The All-New Mickey Mouse Club. Other fellow cast members included Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, and JC Chasez. After the show was canceled in 1994, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. ... I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[28][34]\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[35]\n\nTwo weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[35] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster said about Spears' audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal ... For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[28] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[36] They assigned her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month; he reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[37] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary\". She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.\"[28] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop, and Rami Yacoub, among others.[28]\n\n1998–2000: ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again\n\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour, titled L'Oreal Hair Zone Mall Tour, to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[38] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[28] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[39] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[29]\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" was released as the lead single from the album on September 29, 1998. Originally, Jive Records wanted the associated music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected this idea, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[37] The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks in January–February 1999. It sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[40][41] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[42] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[43] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[44] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[45] The album's third single \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 30 million copies worldwide,[46] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[47][48]\n\nOn June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[49] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[50] An extension of the tour, titled (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[34]\n\nOops!... I Did It Again, Spears' second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[51] It has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[52] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops! – under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition.\"[53] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and many other European nations,[45][54] while the second single \"Lucky\", peaked at number one in Austria, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[55]\n\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[29][56] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[57] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[29] Spears and Timberlake both graduated from high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[58][59] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[60] In her 2023 memoir, Spears revealed that she had an abortion in late 2000 while dating Timberlake after he said they were not prepared for parenthood.[61][62] Spears called the abortion \"one of the most agonizing things I have ever experienced in my life.\"[63]\n\nIn January 2001, Spears hosted the 28th Annual American Music Awards, starred at Rock in Rio alongside NSYNC, and performed as a special guest in the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show headlined by Aerosmith and NSYNC.[64][65] In February 2001, she signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, A Mother's Gift.[29] Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001, with a funkier sound inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and the Neptunes.[66] Britney debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom, and mainland Europe, and has sold 10 million copies worldwide.[45][67][68]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. ... It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[69] It was nominated for the Grammy awards for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\", and in 2007 it was named one of the best albums of the preceding 25 years by Entertainment Weekly.[70] The lead single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top-ten hit in several countries.[71]\n\nSpears' performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger (wrangled by Bhagavan Antle) and a large albino python draped over her shoulders.[72] It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[57] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News summarized Spears' performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting – surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits – Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[73]\n\nTo support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pièce de résistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[74][75] The tour grossed $53.3 million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[76][77] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[78] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears' acting. The film was a box office success,[79][80][81] grossing over $61.1 million worldwide on a $12 million budget.[81]\n\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November due to mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[82] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[83] Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years.[84] In November 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been engaging in an affair,[85][86] fueled by further rumors of possible relationships involving Timberlake's choreographer Wade Robson and Limp Bizkit's frontman Fred Durst.[87] Spears had initially denied the allegations of a possible affair involving Durst, despite the two being spotted together on multiple occasions; even claiming the two had a friendly connection.[88] In 2023, she admitted to engaging in an affair with Robson.[89] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[90][91][92][93][94]\n\n2003–2005: In the Zone and first two marriages\n\nIn August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized. In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[95] while Blender cited it as one of the 25 sexiest music moments on television history.[96]\n\nSpears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[29] Vibe called it \"a supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears' development as a songwriter\".[97] NPR named it one of the most important recordings of the decade, writing that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work\".[98] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[29] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands.[99] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"—which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[29]\n\nIn January 2004, Spears married her childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[100]\n\nIn March 2004, Spears embarked on the Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[101] The tour was canceled in June 2004, when she fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". She underwent arthroscopic surgery and wore a thigh brace for six weeks, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation.[102] That year, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[103]\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months earlier. The romance was the subject of intense media attention, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[29] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears' first reality show Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, which premiered on May 17, 2005, on UPN. Spears later referred to the show in a 2013 interview as \"probably the worst thing I've done in my career\".[104] They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[105]\n\nShortly after, she released her first perfume, Curious, with Elizabeth Arden, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[29] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[106] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[107] Spears' cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy, and Norway.[108] The second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries of mainland Europe.[109][110] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son named Sean Preston, who was born the following month.[111] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of 11 remixes.[112]\n\nIn February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[29] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber-Louise.[113] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in May 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion\".[103] Spears posed nude for the August 2006 cover of Harper's Bazaar; the photograph was compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[29] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second son, Jayden James.[114] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[115] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the two reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their sons.[116]\n\nSpears' maternal aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[117] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[118] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[119] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her sons to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[120] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video \"Do Somethin'\" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[121]\n\nIn October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada and Ireland, at number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, and the top ten in Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, and many European nations. In the United States, it was Spears' first album not to debut at number one, although, she did become the only female artist to have her first five studio albums debut at the two top slots of the chart.[122] The album received positive reviews from critics and had sold 3.1 million copies worldwide by the end of 2008.[123][124] Blackout won Album of the Year at the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards and was listed as the fifth Best Pop Album of the Decade by The Times.[125][126]\n\nSpears performed the lead single \"Gimme More\" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance was widely panned by critics.[127] Despite the criticism, the single enjoyed worldwide success, peaking at number one in Canada and within the top ten in almost every country it charted.[128][129] The second single \"Piece of Me\" reached the top of the charts in Ireland and reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year,[130] and respectively reached numbers seven and nine in Ireland and Canada.[131][132] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[133]\n\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears' visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of their sons. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold under California state law. The court placed her under a conservatorship led by her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[29][134] She was released five days later.[135][136]\n\nThe following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby. She received positive reviews for her performance, as well as bringing the series its highest ratings ever.[137][138] In July 2008, Spears regained some visitation rights after coming to an agreement with Federline and his counsel.[139] In September 2008, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with a pre-taped comedy sketch with Jonah Hill and an introduction speech. She won Best Female Video, Best Pop Video, and Video of the Year for \"Piece of Me\".[140] A 60-minute introspective documentary, Britney: For the Record, was produced to chronicle Spears' return to the recording industry. Directed by Phil Griffin, For the Record was shot in Beverly Hills, Hollywood, and New York City during the third quarter of 2008.[141] The documentary was broadcast on MTV to 5.6 million viewers for the two airings on the premiere night. It was the highest rating in its Sunday night timeslot and in the network's history.[142]\n\nIn December 2008, Spears' sixth studio album Circus was released. It received positive reviews from critics[143] and debuted at number one in Canada, Czech Republic, and the United States, and within the top ten in many European nations.[129][144] In the United States, Spears became the youngest female artist to have five albums debut at number one, earning a place in Guinness World Records.[145] She also became the only act in the SoundScan era to have four albums debut with 500,000 or more copies sold.[144] The album was one of the fastest-selling albums of the year,[146] and has sold 4 million copies worldwide.[147] Its lead single, \"Womanizer\", became Spears' first chart-topper on the Billboard Hot 100 since \"...Baby One More Time\". The single also topped the charts in Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, and Sweden.[148][149] It was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.[150]\n\nIn January 2009, Spears and her father obtained a restraining order against her former manager Sam Lutfi, ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib, and attorney Jon Eardley, all of whom had been accused of conspiring to gain control of Spears' affairs.[151] Spears embarked on The Circus Starring Britney Spears tour in March 2009. With a gross of U.S. $131.8 million, it became the fifth highest-grossing tour of the year.[152] In November 2009, Spears released her second greatest hits album, The Singles Collection.

Its peak in the United States tied Spears with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women.[11] Femme Fatale has been certified platinum by the RIAA and as of February 2014, it had sold 2.4 million copies worldwide.[160][161]\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Hold It Against Me\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Spears' fourth number-one single on the chart and making her the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number one, after Mariah Carey.[162] The second single \"Till the World Ends\" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 in May,[163] while the third single \"I Wanna Go\" reached number seven in August. Femme Fatale became Spears' first album in which three of its songs reached the top ten of the chart. The fourth and final single \"Criminal\" was released in September 2011. The music video sparked controversy when British politicians criticized Spears for using replica guns while filming the video in a London area that had been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.[164] Spears' management briefly responded, stating, \"The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened.\"[165] In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix of Rihanna's song \"S&M\".[166] It reached number one in the US later that month, giving Spears her fifth number one on the chart.[167] On Billboard's 2011 Year-End list, Spears was ranked number fourteen on the Artists of the Year,[168] thirty-two on Billboard 200 artists, and ten on Billboard Hot 100 artists.[169][170] Spears co-wrote \"Whiplash\", a song from the album When the Sun Goes Down (2011) by Selena Gomez & the Scene.[171]\n\nIn June 2011, Spears embarked on her Femme Fatale Tour.[172] The first ten dates of the tour grossed $6.2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar's Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year.[173] The tour ended on December 10, 2011, in Puerto Rico, after 79 performances.[174] A DVD of the tour was released in November 2011.[175] In August 2011, Spears received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards.[176] The next month, she released her second remix album, B in the Mix: The Remixes Vol. 2.[177] In December 2011, Spears became engaged to her long-time boyfriend Jason Trawick, who had formerly been her agent.[178] Trawick was legally granted a role as co-conservator, alongside her father, in April 2012.[179]\n\nIn May 2012, Spears was hired to replace Paula Abdul as a judge for the second season of the USA show of The X Factor, joining Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid, and fellow new judge Demi Lovato, who replaced Nicole Scherzinger. With a reported salary of $15 million, she became the highest-paid judge on a singing competition series in television history.[180] However, Katy Perry broke her record in 2018 after Perry was signed for a $25-million salary to serve as a judge on ABC's revival of American Idol.[181][182] Spears mentored the Teens category; her final act, Carly Rose Sonenclar, was named the runner-up of the season. Spears did not return for the show's third season and was replaced by Paulina Rubio.[183]\n\nSpears appeared on the song \"Scream & Shout\" with will.i.am, which was released as the third single from his fourth studio album, #willpower (2013).

In total, the tour grossed $54.3 million with 260,531 tickets sold and was the sixth highest-grossing female tour of 2018, and was the United Kingdom's second best-selling female tour of 2018.[252][253]\n\nOn March 20, 2018, Spears was announced as part of a campaign for French luxury fashion house Kenzo.[254] The company said it aimed to shake up the 'jungle' world of fashion with Spears' 'La Collection Memento No. 2' campaign.[255] On April 12, 2018, Spears was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[256] On April 27, 2018, Epic Rights announced a new partnership with Spears to debut her own fashion line in 2019, which would include clothing, fitness apparel, accessories, and electronics.[257]\n\nIn July 2018, Spears released her first unisex fragrance, Prerogative.[258] On October 18, 2018, Spears announced her second Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Domination, which was set to launch at Park MGM's Park Theatre on February 13, 2019.[259] Spears was slated to make $507,000 per show, which would have made her the highest paid act on the Las Vegas Strip.[259][260] On October 21, 2018, Spears performed at the Formula One Grand Prix in Austin, the final performance of her Piece of Me Tour.[261]\n\nOn January 4, 2019, Spears announced an indefinite hiatus and the cancellation of her Las Vegas residency after her father, Jamie, suffered a near-fatal colon rupture.[262] In March 2019, Andrew Wallet resigned as co-conservator of her estate after 11 years.[263] Spears entered a psychiatric facility amidst stress from her father's illness that same month.[264] The following month, a fan podcast, Britney's Gram, released a voicemail message from a source who claimed to be a former member of Spears' legal team. They alleged that Jamie had canceled the residency due to Spears' refusal to take her medication, that he had been holding her in the facility against her will since January 2019 after she violated a no-driving rule, and that her conservatorship was supposed to have ended in 2009.[265][266] The allegations gave rise to a movement to terminate the conservatorship, #FreeBritney,[267] which received support from celebrities including singers Cher, Paris Hilton, and Miley Cyrus, and the nonprofit organization American Civil Liberties Union.[268][269][270][271] On April 22, 2019, fans protested outside the West Hollywood City Hall and demanded Spears' release.[264] Spears said \"all [was] well\" two days later and left the facility later that month.[272][273]\n\nIn a May 2019 hearing, Judge Brenda Penny ordered a professional evaluation of the conservatorship.[274] In September, Spears' ex-husband Federline obtained a restraining order against Britney's father, Jamie, following an alleged physical altercation between Jamie and one of her sons.[275] Spears' longtime care manager, Jodi Montgomery, temporarily replaced Jamie as her conservator that same month,[276] which also saw a hearing where no decisions about the arrangement were reached.[277] An interactive pop-up museum dedicated to Spears, dubbed \"The Zone\", opened in Los Angeles in February 2020, though it was later suspended in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.[278][279] She released Glory's Japanese-exclusive bonus track, \"Mood Ring\" as a single, and debuted a new cover of the album to streaming and digital platforms worldwide in May 2020.[280] In August, Jamie called the #FreeBritney movement \"a joke\" and its organizers \"conspiracy theorists\".[281]\n\nOn August 17, 2020, Spears' court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, submitted a court filing that documented Spears' desire to have her conservatorship altered to reflect her wishes as well as lifestyle, to instate Montgomery as her permanent conservator,[282] and to replace Jamie with a fiduciary as conservator of her estate.[283] Four days later, Penny extended the established arrangement until February 2021.[284] In November 2020, Penny approved Bessemer Trust as co-conservator of Spears' estate alongside Jamie.[285] The following month, Spears released a new deluxe edition of Glory, which includes \"Mood Ring\" and new songs \"Swimming in the Stars\" and \"Matches\".[286]\n\nA documentary about Spears' career and conservatorship, Framing Britney Spears, premiered on FX in February 2021.[287] Spears later revealed that she had seen parts of the documentary, stating that she felt humiliated by the perception of her that was presented and that she \"cried for two weeks\" following the initial broadcast.[288] The following month, Ingham filed a petition to permanently replace Jamie with Montgomery as the conservator of Spears' person,[289] citing a 2014 order that determined that Spears did not have the capacity to consent to medical treatment of any form.[290]\n\nOn June 22, 2021, shortly before Spears was set to speak to the court, The New York Times obtained confidential court documents stating that Spears had pushed for years to end her conservatorship.[19] Spears spoke to the court on June 23, calling the conservatorship \"abusive\". She said she had lied by \"telling the whole world I'm OK and I'm happy\", and that she was traumatized and angry.[291][292][293] The court statement received widespread media coverage and generated over 1 million shares on Twitter, over 500,000 messages using the tag #FreeBritney, and more than 150,000 messages with a new hashtag referencing the court appearance, #BritneySpeaks.[294][295]\n\nOn July 1, Bessemer Trust asked the judge to allow them to withdraw from the conservatorship, saying that they had been misled and had entered into the arrangement on the understanding that the conservatorship was voluntary.[296] The same day, senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey Jr. called on federal agencies to increase oversight of the country's conservatorship systems.[297] Spears' manager of 25 years, Larry Rudolph, resigned on July 6 due to her \"intention to officially retire\"[298] and on that same day, it was reported that Ingham planned to file documents to the court asking to be dismissed.[299] In a July 14 hearing, Judge Penny approved the resignations of Bessemer Trust and Ingham. The court also approved of Spears' request to hire attorney Mathew S. Rosengart to represent her. Rosengart informed the court that he would be working to terminate the conservatorship.[300] Later that day, Spears publicly endorsed the #FreeBritney movement for the first time, using the hashtag in a caption on an Instagram post. She mentioned feeling \"blessed\" after earning \"real representation\", referring to Judge Penny's decision to allow her to choose her own counsel.[301]\n\nOn July 26, Rosengart filed a petition seeking to remove Jamie as conservator of Spears' estate and to replace him with Jason Rubin, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) at Certified Strategies Inc. in Woodland Hills, California.[302] On August 12, Jamie agreed to step down as conservator at some future date, with his lawyers stating that he wanted \"an orderly transition to a new conservator\".[303] On September 7, Jamie filed a petition to end the conservatorship.[304] Five days later, Spears announced her engagement to her longtime boyfriend, Sam Asghari, through an Instagram post.[305] On September 29, Judge Penny suspended Jamie as conservator of Spears' estate, with accountant John Zabel replacing him on a temporary basis.[306] On November 12, Judge Penny terminated the conservatorship.[4]\n\n2022–present: Third marriage, The Woman in Me, and retirement from singing\n\nIn April 2022, she announced her pregnancy with Asghari's child,[307] which ended in a miscarriage the following month.[308] The couple married on June 9 at her home in Thousand Oaks, Los Angeles.[309] None of Spears' immediate family (including her parents, sister, and brother) were invited; her two sons did not attend.[310][311] Spears' first husband, Jason Alexander, attempted to crash the wedding by breaking into her home, armed with a knife, but was arrested.[312] Spears had a three-year restraining order against him.[313] On August 26, Spears and English musician Elton John released the duet \"Hold Me Closer\", a remake of John's 1972 single \"Tiny Dancer\".[314][315] It was Spears' first musical release since the termination of her conservatorship.[316] \"Hold Me Closer\" debuted at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming her 14th top-ten single and her highest-charting song in the chart since \"Scream & Shout\" (2012).[317] It debuted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, earning Spears her 24th top-ten.[318]\n\nSince the termination of her conservatorship, Spears' personal life, social media presence, and overall well-being have been subject to renewed media interest and fan speculation, giving rise to conspiracy theories.[319] On January 24, 2023, deputies from the Ventura County Sheriff's Office performed a welfare check at Spears' residence after receiving several calls from fans who were concerned after she deleted her Instagram account. A spokesperson for the Sheriff's Department stated that Spears \"was safe and in no danger\". Spears addressed the incident on her Twitter account, asking fans to respect her privacy.[320] Spears and the rapper will.i.am released their single, \"Mind Your Business\", on July 21, 2023.[321] On August 16, it was announced Spears and Asghari separated after 14 months of marriage.[322] On May 1, 2024, they reached a divorce settlement.[323][324] The following day, the judge signed off on the settlement and the couple were divorced on December 2, 2024.[325] In September 2023, an additional welfare check was initiated when Spears posted an Instagram video of herself dancing with knives. Her security team assured the attending officer that there was no immediate threat to her safety, and the officer departed. Spears also clarified that the knives were not real.[326]\n\nIn February 2022, Spears signed a $15 million book deal for a memoir in one of the biggest book deals of all time.[327][328] The memoir, The Woman in Me, was released on October 24, 2023.[329] It details her rise to fame, public media events, her conservatorship, and her newfound freedom.[330] In the United States, it sold 1.1 million copies, while worldwide it sold 2.4 million copies in print sales during its first week of release.[331][332]\n\nIn January 2024, reports circulated that Charli XCX and Julia Michaels had been asked to write songs for Spears, and Rolling Stone reported that \"management and A&R are trying to get her excited for the music\". Spears denied the reports, saying she would never return to the music industry. However, she also said that she had written more than 20 songs for other artists in the previous two years.[333] In May 2024, Charli XCX confirmed in an interview that she was indeed asked to write for Spears, for which she traveled to Malibu, but that she did not know if Spears was a part of the process explaining that \"the team were present... But she didn't record it. She obviously didn't.\"[334]\n\nSpears has cited Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Whitney Houston as major influences, her \"three favorite artists\" as a child, whom she would \"sing along to ... day and night in [her] living room\"; Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" was the song she auditioned to that landed her record deal with Jive Records.[335] Spears also named Mariah Carey as \"one of the main reasons I started singing\".[336] Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Jackson in particular, in terms of vocals, choreography, and stage presence. According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people ... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[337]\n\nIn the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[338] Spears cited \"That's the Way Love Goes\" as the inspiration for her song \"Touch of My Hand\" from her album In the Zone, saying \"I like to compare it to 'That's the Way Love Goes,' kind of a Janet Jackson thing.\"[339] She also said her song \"Just Luv Me\" from her Glory album also reminded her of \"That's the Way Love Goes\".[340]\n\nAfter meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[341] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist ... There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[342] Spears has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyoncé, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as inspirations,[343][344][345] and younger artists such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[346][347]\n\nSpears is described as a pop artist[18] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[350] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[351] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[352] In a review of ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry\".[353] Oops!... I Did It Again saw Spears working with several R&B producers to create \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga\".[354] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&B, disco, and funk.[69][355]\n\nSpears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[356][357] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop, which are most present on In the Zone and Blackout. In the Zone also experiments with Euro trance, reggae, and Middle Eastern music.[357][358][359] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[360][361] Spears' ninth studio album Glory is more eclectic and experimental than her previous released work. She commented that it \"took a lot of time ... it's really different ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time now, and I just haven't really done that.\"[362]\n\n...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again address themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[363][364] Following the massive commercial success of her first two studio albums, Spears' team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[363] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She co-wrote five songs and choose each track's producer on her third studio album, Britney, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality, and self-discovery.[69][363][355] Sex, dancing, freedom, and love continued to be Spears' music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[358][359][361][360] Her fifth studio effort, Blackout, also addresses issues such as fame and media scrutiny, including on the song \"Piece of Me\".[359][365]\n\nSpears' music has also been noted for some catchphrases. The opening in her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Oh, baby baby\" is considered to be one of her signature lines and has been parodied in the media by various artists such as Nicole Scherzinger and Ariana Grande.[366] It has been used in variating forms throughout her music, such as simply, \"baby\" and \"oh baby\", as well as the Blackout track, \"Ooh Ooh Baby\". On the initial development of \"...Baby One More Time\", Barry Weiss noted Spears' inception of the catchphrase from her strange ad-libbing during the recording of the song. He commented further, \"We thought it was really weird at first. It was strange. It was not the way Max wrote it. But it worked! We thought it could be a really good opening salvo for her.\"[367] The opening line in \"Gimme More\", \"It's Britney, bitch\" has become another signature phrase.[368] An early review of Blackout suggested the phrase was \"simply laughable\".[368] Amy Roberts of Bustle called it \"an indelible cultural turning point, transforming a frenetic, floundering moment in the superstar's career to one of strength and empowerment\".[368]\n\nSpears is a soprano.[373][374][375][376] Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range.[377][378] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears on her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today—distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[35] Rami Yacoub, who co-produced Spears' debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"\n\nGuy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. ... Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[380] Producer William Orbit, who worked with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[381]\n\nSpears has also been criticized for her reliance on Auto-Tune[382] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[383] Erlewine criticized Spears' singing abilities in a review of her Blackout album, stating: \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[359] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[384]\n\nKayla Upadhyaya of The Michigan Daily has provided a different point of view, stating: \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define [Spears]'s voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[385] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly opines that \"Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of sound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[386]\n\nSpears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited with influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[387][388] Rolling Stone readers voted Spears their second-favorite dancing musician.[389] Spears is described as being much more shy than her stage persona suggests.[104][390][391] She said that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[392] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances were lauded,[393] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[394] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"an effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[375]\n\nAfter her knee injuries and personal problems, Spears' \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[387][395] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and stated: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[396] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears' efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[397]\n\nIt has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[388][398][399] which often prompts criticism from music critics and concert goers.[395][400][401] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[402] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[403] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, the Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? ... you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[404] Spears herself has commented on the topic, arguing: \"Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback. ... It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it\".[398]\n\nIn 2012, VH1 ranked Spears as the fourth Greatest Woman of the Video Era,[405] while Billboard ranked her as the eight Greatest Music Video Artist of All Time in 2020, explaining: \"The storylines, the dancing, the outfits. Right from the start, the pop princess established the lengths of her creativity with some of the most memorable videos of the last three decades.\"[406] She has been retroactively noted as the pioneer for her early career videography.[407] She conceptualized the \"iconic Catholic schoolgirl and cheerleader motif\" in the \"...Baby One More Time\" video, rejecting the animation video idea. She also made the \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" video \"dance-centric rather than space-centric as her producers suggested\". She also used her dancer's intuition to help select the beats for each track.[407]\n\nUpon launching her music career with ...Baby One More Time, Spears was labeled a teen idol,[409] and Rolling Stone described her as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[28] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone pictured a 17-year-old Spears reclining on a bed, wearing an exposed bra and hot pants while cradling a Teletubby in one arm.[410][411][412][413] The American Family Association (AFA) decried the image as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\"[411][414] and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums\".[415] Spears addressed the outcry, commenting: \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. ... I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[416] Shortly before this, Spears had announced publicly she would remain abstinent until marriage.[29][417]\n\nAn early criticism of Spears dismissed her as \"the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona\". Vox editor Constance Grady wrote this was perpetuated from the fact that Spears debuted in the late 1990s, when music was dominated by rockism, that prizes \"so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else\". Spears' \"slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her.\" Ron Levy for Rolling Stone noted that \"I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!\"[407]\n\nBillboard opined that, by the time Spears released her sophomore album Oops!... I Did It Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001's Britney, which shed her innocent skin and ushered her into adulthood.\"[418] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its music video were also credited for distancing her from her previous \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image.[419][420] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic remarked, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine likened Spears to fellow singer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[358] Brittany Spanos of LA Weekly stated that Spears \"set the bar for the 'adulthood' transition teen pop stars often struggle with\".[421]\n\nSpears' erratic behavior and personal problems during 2006–2008 were highly publicized[422] and affected both her career and public image.[359][423] Erlewine writes that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[359] In a 2008 article, Rolling Stone's Vanessa Grigoriadis described her much-publicized personal issues as \"the most public downfall of any star in history\".[423] Spears later received favorable media attention; Billboard wrote that her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards \"was a picture of professionalism and poise\" after her \"disastrous\" performance the previous year,[424] while Business Insider ran an article on how she had \"lost control of her life ... and then made an incredible career comeback\".[425] In 2017, Spears said: \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. ... I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that's who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[426]\n\nIn September 2002, Spears was placed at number eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list.[427] She was placed at number one on FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2004,[428] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12th on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[429] Remarking upon her perceived image as a sex symbol, Spears stated: \"When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that — and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[363] In 2003, People cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[430]\n\nSpears is recognized as a gay icon and received the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[256] She addressed the \"unwavering loyalty\" and \"lack of judgment\" of her LGBTQ fans in Billboard's Love Letters to the LGBTQ Community. She said: \"Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy, and make me and my sons strive to be better people.\"[431] Manuel Betancourt of Vice wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears' fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga ... she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[390] HuffPost's Ben Appel attributed Spears' status as a gay icon to her \"oh-so-innocent/not that innocent\" Monroe-like sensuality, her sweet, almost saccharine nature, her beyond basic but addictive pop songs, her dance moves, her phoenix-out-of-the-fire comeback from a series of mental health crises, and her unmistakable tenderness. \"Britney is camp. She is a fashion plate. A doll. Britney is a drag queen.\"[432]\n\nSince her early years in the public eye, Spears has been a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target.[418][417][433] According to Vanity Fair, photos of Spears sold for a combined value of $100 million in 2007.[434] Harvey Levin, the founder of TMZ, said in an interview, \"Britney is gold. She is crack to our readers. Her life is a complete train-wreck, and I thank God for her every day.\"[435][434][410] Steve Huey of AllMusic remarked that \"among female singers of [Spears'] era ... her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[417] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[436] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[437] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000–2009.[438]\n\nAs a public figure, Spears \"has never been known to her fans as a politically active, committed—or even aware—entertainer.\"[350] In a 2003 interview with Tucker Carlson, she commented on President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes ... and be faithful in what happens\".[439] Michael Moore included the footage of Spears' answer in his \"anti-Bush\" documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, which, according to The Washington Times's James Frazier, presented her \"as an example of a naive American blindly trusting a dishonest commander in chief\" and fueled the \"urban legend\" of a \"conservative\" Spears. Frazier also said that \"the few positions she has taken can hardly be considered conservative\", such as supporting same-sex marriage.[350] In 2016, Spears posted pictures of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on social media. She described Clinton as \"an inspiration and [a] beautiful voice for women around the world\".[440]\n\nIn December 2017, Spears publicly showed support for the DREAM Act in the wake of the announcement that Donald Trump would end the DACA policy, which previously granted undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation. She posted a photo of herself on social media wearing a black T-shirt that reads \"We Are All Dreamers\" in white letters. The caption read, \"Tell Congress to pass the #DreamAct\".[441]\n\nOn September 15, 2021, Spears was named one of the 100 most influential people of 2021 by Time. A few days before the editors's list was released, Spears was put at the top of the readers voting list of which personalities should be included on the annual Time 100 list. Deemed an icon of 2021, editors highlighted the impact of her fight against her conservatorship as well as of the #FreeBritney movement.[16][442] In October 2021, Spears thanked her fans and the #FreeBritney movement for \"freeing me from my conservatorship\".[443] Britney Spears was also named most famous celebrity from Louisiana according to a study done by Baton Rouge.[444]\n\nReferred to as the \"Princess of Pop\",[445][446] Spears was credited as one of the \"driving force[s] behind the return of teen pop in the late 1990s\".[417][351] Rolling Stone's Stacy Lambe explained that she \"help[ed] to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. ... Spears would lead an army of pop stars ... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time—and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[446] In a 2021 article for Time, Maura Johnston opined that \"Spears' legacy as a pop artist is complex, made up of dazzling musical heights and music-business-borne lows\". Johnston also commented: \"While Spears' catalog is part of the canon that defines the first 20 years of this millennium, one hopes that her public struggles, and the strength she's shown while enduring them, will lead to her cementing her true legacy: Reshaping the machine that turns those songs into cultural touchstones.\"[447]\n\nGlamour contributor Christopher Rosa described her as \"one of pop music's defining voices. ... When she emerged onto the scene in 1998 with ...Baby One More Time, the world hadn't seen a performer like her. Not since Madonna had a female artist affected the genre so profoundly.\"[448] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears' \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come\".[449] In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number one on a list of the 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time and Rob Sheffield described it as \"One of those pop manifestos that announces a new sound, a new era, a new century. But most of all, a new star ... With \"...Baby One More Time\", [Spears] changed the sound of pop forever: It's Britney, bitch. Nothing was ever the same.\"[450]\n\nSpears was at the forefront of the female teen pop explosion starting in 1999 and extending through the 2000s, leading the pack of Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore.[451] All of these performers had been developing material in 1998, but the market changed dramatically in December 1998 when Spears' single and video were charting highly. RCA Records quickly signed Aguilera and released her debut single to capitalize on Spears' success, producing her debut hit single \"Genie in a Bottle\".[452] Simpson consciously modeled her persona as more mature than Spears; her \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" charted in September 1999, and her album Sweet Kisses followed shortly after.[453][454] Moore's first single, \"Candy\", hit the airwaves a month before Simpson's single, but it did not perform as well on the charts; Moore was often seen as less accomplished than Spears and the others, coming in fourth of the \"pop princesses\".[455][456] Fueling media stories about their competition for first place, Spears and Aguilera traded barbs but also compliments through the 2000s.[457]\n\nAlim Kheraj of Dazed called Spears \"one of pop's most important pioneers\".[458] After eighteen years as a performer, Billboard described her as having \"earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[418] Entertainment Weekly's Adam Markovitz described Spears as \"an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster.\"[386] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[405] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[459] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[460] In 2020, Billboard ranked her eight on its 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of all-time list.[406] In October 2024, Billboard placed Spears at number six on their Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century list.[461]\n\nSpears and her work have influenced various artists including Katy Perry,[462] Meghan Trainor,[463] Demi Lovato,[462] Kelly Key,[464] Kristinia DeBarge,[465] Little Boots,[466] Charli XCX,[467] Chappell Roan,[468] Marina Diamandis,[469] the Weeknd,[470] Tegan and Sara,[471] Pixie Lott,[472] Grimes,[473] Selena Gomez,[474] Hailee Steinfeld,[475] Pabllo Vittar,[476] Tinashe,[477] Victoria Justice,[478] Cassie,[479] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[480] the Saturdays,[481] Normani,[482] Miley Cyrus,[483] Cheryl,[484] Lana Del Rey,[485] Ava Max,[486] Sam Smith,[487] and Rina Sawayama.[488] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[176] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time\".[489]\n\nBefore Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about – not just pop stars – but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. ... She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[490] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[491] Lana Del Rey said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[492] Porcelain Black describes her music as a \"love child\" of Spears and Marilyn Manson.[493] Rita Ora's 2019 music video for \"Only Want You\" was inspired by Spears' \"Everytime\" music video, and said in a stories from Instagram, \"Hey @britneyspears this was for you because I love you so. Pay homage to the ones who inspire! #icon.\"[494]\n\nSpears has been credited with redefining Las Vegas residencies as a retirement place for musicians. Her debut concert residency Britney: Piece of Me was described as \"the natural evolution of Celine Dion's powerhourse Vegas residency, a still-charting star of another generation redefining the role of Strip headliner.\" Forbes named Spears the sixth-highest-earning female musician of 2015.\" She is credited with influencing and paving the way for other artists's residencies such as Jennifer Lopez's Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, Bruno Mars's Bruno Mars at Park MGM, and Backstreet Boys' Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.[495] The arrival of Spears \"saw the pop promoters finally tap into the younger crowd arriving in town for a good time\".[496]\n\nSpears' much-publicized personal problems and her subsequent career comeback have inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in the 2010 film Country Strong was inspired by Spears' treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[497] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears' comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[498] Spears' hounding by paparazzi and personal problems also inspired Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. ... We all looked at it in horror ... So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[499] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[500]\n\nIn 2008, Salon published an article titled \"The Britney Economy\" describing how Spears is a driving force in music and fashion, stimulating consumer purchases and media coverage. Magazines, paparazzi, and record labels make millions of dollars, and Spears profits to a lesser degree.[501][502][503] Along with Alicia Silverstone, Christy Turlington, and Naomi Campbell, Spears has been credited with introducing the navel piercing to mainstream culture.[504][505][506][507]\n\nSpears' awards and accolades include a Grammy Award; 15 Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[508] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award; and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[509]\n\nSpears is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, which sold over 13 million copies in the United States.[510] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears had sold over 37 million albums worldwide\".[511]\n\nAs of 2023 , according to the Evening Standard, Spears has sold over 150 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[512] She also sold more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[513] Spears is further recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[7] In December 2009, Billboard ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[10] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number-one single and a number-one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[514] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[162] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[515]\n\nIn 2000, Spears released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[516] In 2001, she signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[517] and a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[518] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyoncé, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[519] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[520]\n\nIn March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[521] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, said: \"Everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[521] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[155] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever, and Plenty of Fish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[522]\n\nSpears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". She was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game.[523] Spears was also featured on the commercial of Twister Dance Rave, and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\". In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of Kenzo, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[254]\n\nSpears' range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[29] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[524][525] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance.[526]\n\nIn 2011, Radiance was reissued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[527] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5 billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with iOS and Android.[225] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[528] As of January 2018 , Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[529]\n\nSpears founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[530] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[531] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1 million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[532] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[533] After Spears went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[534]\n\nOn October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released an album consisting of multiple versions of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\", intending to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[535] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[536] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[537] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[538] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[536]\n\nOn October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[539] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[540] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[541] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1 million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears' ticket sales and merchandise.[542] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[543] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[544] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[545]\n\nIn March 2020, Spears was participating in the #DoYourPartChallenge, which entails helping people with anything they might need during the COVID-19 pandemic. She told fans to send her messages on Instagram if they need supportive words during the coronavirus pandemic, with Spears picking three fans.[546] In February 2024, Spears partnered with New York City dessert shop Glace, to create the \"Britney Brûlée\" dessert, with a portion of the proceeds from its sales being donated to The Trevor Project.[547]\n• Oops!...

The park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Croatia’s oldest and largest national parks. Plitvice is well known for a series of cascading waterfalls connecting sixteen lakes inside a deep gorge, and many of the trails are boardwalks. The park is truly impressive and we all loved exploring it.\n\nWe arrived to the park before it opened, and were able to avoid the crowds for the most part (we’ve heard horror stories about the throngs of people during high season). We only explored the lower lakes section of the park, which took us about 3 hours. Because we were there in the fall, there were lots of leaves on the ground and the kids loved playing around with them. They built leaf piles, jumped on them, and we made it rain leaves onto them as well. It was a lot of fun!\n\nAfter spending the morning in the park, we drove to Pula. Pula is located in the Istria peninsula in north-western Croatia and is an area full of cute little coastal and mountain towns, beautiful wild beaches, and a long and rich history (including being part of Venice and later Italy for about 400 years). Exploring the Istria peninsula of Croatia with or without kids is definitely worth it!\n\nWe picked Pula because it was a good stopping point on our way from Bosnia to Italy, and because we found a good Airbnb apartment there. Our apartment was a quick drive from the city center in a family friendly neighborhood. Our hosts had a 5-year old boy, which meant that there were lots of fun toys laying around for our kids to play with!\n\nPula, and the Istria peninsula, were a big surprise to us. Usually, when thinking about Croatia, it’s places like Split, Hvar or Dubrovnik that come to mind so we had no idea this would be such a fun area to explore! So fun in fact, we thought this would be a great place to come spend an extended period of time. Given its Italian past, a lot of the architecture is Venetian and there are beautiful medieval seaside and hilltop towns with winding cobblestone lanes. Olive oil and wine production date back to the Roman times in the area and the peninsula is well-known for delicious eating. Many people still speak Italian as a first language and we generally found the food to be much more Italian than Croatian. So it was kind of like visiting off-the-beaten track Italy without paying Italian prices!\n\nIstria, like Zagreb, was incredibly kid friendly! People gave our kids nothing but smiles (and treats!) and restaurants felt very family friendly as well. In this part of the world, having kids is such a positive thing, and strangers are always eager to help you or your kids when you need them. For example, when Valentina fell one day, two women basically jumped off their chairs to help her up and make sure she was okay. Sadly, that’s not something you are likely to see in the United States. Croatia definitely is family oriented and it shows.\n\nWhat We Did In Istria\n• We visited the very impressive Roman amphitheater in Pula. It’s nearly 2,000 years old and is the sixth-largest Roman amphitheater in the world today. It was really impressive! The site doesn’t get as many tourists as you would expect, so it was great for the kids to run around, climb up the seating area and play as they pleased.\n• During a rainy day, we explored the small town of Bale. We all suited up with rain gear and explored the town’s narrow cobbled alleys. The town’s old center was tiny and it was fun to wander around. Because it was a rainy Sunday, nothing was open and there were no people on the streets, which added a fun feeling to it. Bale is also known for being a place visited by creative people in search of its good and strong energy.\n• We went to the town of Rovinj to meet up with another traveling family Paola met through Instagram. The mom is from Germany and the dad from the United States, and they have a 2.5 year old boy. We really enjoyed hanging out with them and the kids all played really well together. Per their suggestion, we met at a playground by the seafront and then walked around the town. They had been in the area for a bit longer than us so we happily followed their lead in exploring the town. We look forward to hopefully meeting up again somewhere else in the world!\n• On a different day, we went back to Rovinj to explore more of the town because we really loved it the first time we were there! The town, perched on a peninsula, used to be an island until the channel was filled up in 1763. Rovinj is picture perfect from wherever you look at it. It might be one of the prettiest towns we’ve visited on this entire trip! The kids loved both trips to Rovinj (probably the first one best because they had a friend to play with!). There is a cool playground, a candy store, bakeries, and lots of fun streets to walk on, so it’s a great place for kids!\n• We drove to Cape Kamenjak and spent the morning at a rocky beach, building castles with rocks and soaking up some rays on Halloween day! Cape Kamenjak is a National Park marking the farthest souther point of the Istrian peninsula, and it is full of beaches to explore. The water was crystal clear at the beach we visited, and there were barely any people around.\n• We visited the Aquarium in Pula. The aquarium is housed in a former war bunker built by the Austro-Hungarians in the late 1800s, which we think is the main highlight. The building is fun to explore, including the steep narrow tunnels that take you to what we think used to be bomb shelters and are now used to show the progression of life on Earth. The aquarium itself was fine. It wasn’t the best we’ve visited but the kids really loved it, especially the (somewhat) small shark tank. One thing we appreciated about the aquarium was that there were educational exhibits about preserving the oceans and marine life.\n• We explored the sculpture park at Vrsar by Croatian artist Susan Dzamonja. The sculpture park was fun for the kids mostly because they got to run around the big green space. After the sculpture garden, we headed to the old town and climbed all the way up to the church and took our time going back down to the seaside. This town was super picturesque and fun to explore! We finished the outing with a nice lunch by the sea front.\n\nAfter 9 days in Istria, we felt we only scratched the surface. There are so many little towns to visit and explore. During our time there, we had a lot of rain but that didn’t prevent us from exploring and falling in love with the area. We really recommend this part of Croatia to anyone thinking about visiting the country!\n\nWe are over five months into this big adventure and we can really see how our kids are being shaped by this experience. One big change has been in their fitness. Hugo hardly ever asks for help at the end of a long hike, or while climbing hills. He goes up long stairways and, sometimes, he doesn’t seem to even notice them! Valentina spends most of the day on her feet because she wants to be like her brother. It’s truly been amazing to see them build up their physical skills over the past few months!\n\nWe wrote this post at the start of a month-long adventure in Morocco. But before getting here, we had to drive from Pula to Milan to return our car and catch our flight. On our way to Milan, we made a stop in Piran, Slovenia for the morning and in Venice for a few days.\n\nAfter our month in Morocco, we headed to Malta for two months, and then back to Croatia. We decided to spent the last three months of our year of travels in the city of Split.\n\nBefore leaving Pula, we asked our host to keep the kids’ carseats in his storage room for three months. He graciously agreed to it so, in early February, we returned to Pula to pick up our belongings. We used this opportunity to explore more of the Istria Peninsula with our kids.\n\nDuring our second time in Pula, we visited Ucka National Park. The park was a good stopping point for the kids to burn some energy before the long haul back. We hiked a short trail to see one of the park’s famous rock formations and had a great time! The kids found lots of fossils on the rocks and our kids really enjoyed the hike. We definitely recommend visiting Ucka if you find yourself in Istria. Also, they are an off-the-beaten track attraction so chances are you’ll find a respite from the crowds there!\n\nTo see more destinations from our travels, go here.Rovinj and the Istrian Peninsula: Throughout these transitions, Italian culture and language remained strong in Istria. Even with an exodus of ethnic Italians following World War II, today’s visitors cannot ignore the Italian influence. In fact, the Istrian Province has two official languages - Croatian and Italian. Driving around, you’ll see road signs with names in both languages. So, approaching our destination, we got off the highway at the Rovinj/Rovigno exit, the former the Croatian name, and the latter Italian.\n\nBut, the layout inside the walled city hasn’t changed much, even with this connection. Winding and narrow alleys gradually work their way to the hilltop St. Euphemia Cathedral, which towers over all of Rovinj. Apparently, the eponymous saint was thrown to the lions for refusing to renounce her faith - quite the conviction, regardless of where you fall on the religious spectrum. And, for present day visitors, the cathedral’s tower provides an absolutely stunning view of Rovinj, the harbor, and the surrounding coastline - if you can stomach the narrow, vertigo-inducing staircase to the top!\n\nBut, unlike many apartments we’ve rented, the ancient city’s narrow layout didn’t allow us to simply plug an address into the GPS and park in front of the building. While local residents can get permits to take cars into the old town, physics prevents all but the smallest, European-style autos (or mopeds) from navigating most of these streets. Instead, our host instructed us to meet her in a parking lot on the outskirts of town. From there, we grabbed our bags and followed her on foot through Rovinj’s maze of back alleys to our building’s entrance.\n\nDoing the Local Thing in Rovinj\n\nOn our first morning, we woke up to just a little instant coffee in the cabinet (hadn’t yet stocked our shelves). While instant gets you a caffeine fix in a pinch, it seemed almost sacrilegious in such a coffee mecca to tarnish our palates with a weak powder (or so Chipp declared to a Jenna eyeroll). So, grabbing a mug from the cupboard, Chipp strolled across the alley to a little cafe, gave the barista a few Croatian kuna, and came home sipping some delicious, freshly brewed coffee. While not exactly Cheers, this little routine still had quite the local feel to it!\n\nWe also checked a laundry-related, do-as-the-locals-do box in Rovinj. Up until this point of our travels, all of our apartment rentals had folding drying racks. Washing machines, yes; dryers, no - quite uncommon outside of the US. After doing a load of laundry, we looked around our flat - unsuccessfully - for a drying rack. Then, in true lightbulb-moment fashion, we connected the dots. Every sunny afternoon strolling through old-town Rovinj, old ladies lean out their windows, watching the world go by and drying their laundry. Opening up our window, we solved our problem - drying lines strung outside for us to use.\n\nLooking for a good afternoon hike/stroll, we headed south along this promenade towards the tip of the nature preserve. This cedar- and cypress-covered peninsula served as a medieval-era quarry, supplying the limestone for countless monuments and structures throughout Italy. Centuries later, it was purchased by an individual. Initially meant as a private spa, this idyllic peninsula became a protected area when its former owner died before completing his spa vision. Now, the preserve has miles of shaded trails, climbing walls built into the old quarry walls, beautiful beaches, and plenty of places to find some peace and quiet.\n\nAfter exploring the peninsula (and getting slightly lost in the thick forests atop the quarry), we decided to relax. We found our “peace and quiet” with a couple drinks at a little cabana-style beach bar - Bar Paradiso. Sitting in the shade, drinks in hand with feet in the gravelly sand so common along the Adriatic, we took in the views back towards Rovinj - hard to imagine a more serene place to spend an afternoon.\n\nWhile Croatian labels may not have fully pierced the US market, the country’s an absolute wine powerhouse. Each region of the country has its own specialties, with Istria no different. We’d dive more into the tastings during our time in , but we focused on a related product in Rovinj - Istrian brandy. Whether you want a true grape-based brandy or one made from the countless fruits native to the peninsula, you can find a type of Istrian brandy that gets the job done.\n\nNaturally, we needed to buy a bottle, opting for one produced from the local malvazija grape. And, if you’re going to sip on some brandy, you should probably have a cigar, too, yeah? The logic may not be infallible, but it made sense to Chipp. Posting up on one of the stone beaches beneath Rovinj’s ancient walls, we sipped brandy, snacked on truffle popcorn (another Istrian specialty), and Chipp enjoyed a cigar.\n\nProperly lubricated, we strolled back around the harbor for an open air dinner. Facing west, Rovinj (and Croatia’s entire coast) offers some incredible sunsets. And, when you pick restaurants in the right part of the city, you’re rewarded with an unbelievable dining view - the sun setting just to the left of St. Euphemia’s tower and Rovinj’s walled city. Maestral and Restoran Pastrik jump out as especially delicious Rovinj spots, places we hope to visit again - preferably sooner rather than later!Idyllic Istria: The Istrian Peninsula, jutting out into the northern Adriatic Sea, offers some of the best of coastal Croatia and nearby Italy, but with fewer crowds. It's an inviting mix of Roman history, vineyard-draped hill towns, and pastel seaside villages with a whiff of Venetian flair.\n\nThe seafront port of Rovinj — like a little Venice on a hill — is one of my favorite small towns on the Mediterranean.\n\nRising dramatically from the Adriatic as though being pulled up to heaven by its grand bell tower, there's something particularly romantic about Rovinj. Some locals credit the especially strong Venetian influence here — it's the most Italian town in Croatia's most Italian region (it was even part of Italy between the world wars). Rovinj's streets are delightfully twisty, its ancient houses are characteristically crumbling, and its harbor still hosts a real fishing industry.\n\nPula, on the other hand, isn't quaint. Istria's biggest city is an industrial port town with traffic, smog, and sprawl...but it has the soul of a Roman poet. Between the shipyards, you can discover some of the top Roman ruins in Croatia, including its stately amphitheater — a fully intact mini-Colosseum that marks the entry to a seedy Old Town with ancient temples, arches, and columns.\n\nOf the dozens of amphitheaters left around Europe and North Africa by Roman engineers, Pula's is the sixth-largest, and one of the best-preserved anywhere. Throughout the Middle Ages, scavengers scraped the amphitheater as clean as a nice slice of cantaloupe, leaving just the outside intact. Standing inside, though, you can imagine when it was ringed with two levels of stone seating and a top level of wooden bleachers. You can still see the outline of the actual arena (sandy oval grounds) with the small moat — just wide enough to keep the animals off the laps of those with the best seats, but close enough so that blood still sprayed their togas.\n\nLike most Roman towns, Pula had a forum, or main square. Twenty centuries later, Pula's Forum still serves the same function. The Temple of Augustus, which faces the square, took a direct hit from an Allied bomb in World War II, but was rebuilt after the war. (On one visit I asked my guide if it was an American bomb that destroyed the temple, and he answered sheepishly, \"Yes, a little bit.\")\n\nMost tourists in Croatia focus on the coast. For a dash of variety, head inland to check out the hill towns. In Istria my favorite two are tiny, rugged, and relatively untrampled: the artists' colony of Grožnjan and popular Motovun, with sweeping views of the surrounding countryside.\n\nGrožnjan is a trapped-in-a-time-warp Istrian hill town, artfully balanced on the tip of a vine-and-olive-tree-covered promontory. Its stony, leafy, rough-cobbled lanes are lined with art galleries and, like most Istrian towns with any tourism, shops selling locally produced olive oil and truffle oil. Not long ago, Grožnjan was virtually forgotten. But now artists have taken up residence here, keeping it Old World but with a spiffed-up, bohemian ambience.\n\nDramatically situated high above vineyards, Motovun (population: about 1,000) is the best known and most touristed of the Istrian hill towns. And for good reason: Its hilltop Old Town is particularly evocative, with a colorful old church and a rampart walk with spine-tingling vistas across the entire region. It's hard to believe that race-car driver Mario Andretti was born this tranquil little traffic-free hamlet.\n\nAs you explore, you'll see frequent signs for wineries, olive-oil producers, and truffle shops. One recent trend in Istria is the emergence of agroturizams. Like Italian agriturismi, these are working farms that welcome tourists for a taste of traditional rural life.\n\nOpatija, just outside of the peninsula, is not your typical Croatian beach town. In the late-19th-century golden age of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this unassuming village was transformed into the eastern Riviera, one of the swankiest resorts on the Mediterranean. While the French, British, and German aristocracy sunbathed on France's Côte d'Azur, the wealthy elite from the eastern half of Europe — the Habsburg Empire and Russia — partied in Opatija.\n\nWhile the Habsburgs and Russians are long gone, Opatija retains the trappings of its genteel past. Most of Croatia evokes a more ancient Mediterranean, but Opatija whispers \"belle époque.\" With its welcoming and elegant promenade, it may be the classiest resort town in Croatia, with more taste and less fixation on postcards and seashells.\n\nThe local tourist board carefully manicures this region's image as the hot spot in Croatia to find hill towns, backcountry drives, and a laid-back and relaxing lifestyle. These days, some travelers even mention Istria in the same breath as Tuscany or Provence. While that may be the region's malvazija wine and truffle oil talking, Istria is, by any measure, a delight in itself.public transportation on Istrian peninsula? - Istria Forum - Tripadvisor: I'm reading Elly's post a bit differently, and if I'm correct I have good news for her.\n\nI see her primary concern as getting from Zadar to somewhere in Istria.\n\nThe good news is that getting from Zadar to Istria is slow, but looks like great fun (I haven't actually done this).\n\nYou get a ferry from Zadar, to somewhere, and ferry hop from there.\n\nCroatia Ferries will tell you how to do it. Off the top of my head there is a ferry that goes all the way from Zadar to Rijeka, but stops at a few places along the way.\n\nBus travel from Rijeka to Pula and Rovinj is quite easy. And then a ferry to Venice, if you aren't tired of ferries yet.\n\nThe other possibility, which isn't nearly as much fun, is to get a bus from Zadar to Zagreb (or even fly), and another bus from Zagreb.Rough Draft: 5 Day Itinerary for Istria Peninsula, Croatia: Due to the COVID quarantine, I am creating rough draft, “off the shelf” travel itineraries for when travel resumes normal operations so we do not waste any time getting out and exploring!\n\nCroatia had always be an area of interest since Bourdain’s episode covering the country’s wine and food scene. But what brought my attention to it during this uncertain travel time was that Croatia is actually allowing for visitors from the US as tourists. There are a ton of details – including PCR covid testing within 48 hours (which is quite tricky to accomplish at the moment – the 72 hours window is stressful enough) and travel declaration – but thought it could be a good time to look more closely in the event we are able to safely go.\n\nLike its European neighbors, there is such a variety to Croatia giving travelers ample choices to make the trip that is right for them. Most people associate Croatia for the beautiful coastline and beach life. Since those are the more popular destinations, I turned my attention to the Istria peninsula – land of wine and truffles. And there are still beaches here with a bonus of caves and hiking though national parks. I had no idea all this amazingness could be found here!\n\nDepending on if you are visiting this area exclusively or adding it as a larger itinerary, there are a few ways to get to the Istria Peninsula. If you wanted to focus solely on this region, there is an airport in Pula in the southern part of the peninsula. If you are up for a road trip, you can fly in Zagreb – it is a three hour drive and there are plenty of places to stop along the way. And more famously, there are the cities in the south can you can also create an extended trip with. Also, having a car seems beneficial for getting around this region.\n\nWhat is there to do?\n\nThe main draw for this trip is the richness of the Istria Peninsula and it is easy to spent an entire week just in this area.\n• Town hopping – there are tons of small towns that make up this region – Pula, Rovinj, Umag, Motovun to name a few!\n• Wine tasting – this region has been referred to as “new Tuscany” so needless to say there are some great gems for wine and reasonably priced. Like most European wine regions, the tastings are more casual and informal – there is not a proper tasting room and the person pouring the wine often is actively working. Some of the wineries allow for appointments to be set up ahead of time or you can also take a structured tour with a guide to see multiple places at once. Here are the ones I have marked to visit:\n• Outdoor activities – while I expect to see gorgeous beaches, what I did not expect was to find caves and mountainous areas to explore!\n• Pazin Cave – guided tours down into the cave\n• Sopot Waterfall – you can drive or walk to this hidden waterfall\n• Ucka Mountain – there are several trails that wrap to the top for a panoramic view\n\nIt is hard to have a bad meal – just avoid those tourist spots! Croatia is known for their seafood but do not miss out of those delightful truffles. For the areas on this trip, here are the restaurants I have marked to visit:\n\nBased on the above information and the proximity of each activity, here is how I would structure 5 days in the Istria Peninsula of Croatia, excluding the travel time to get there. Days are interchangeable and are grouped by location in the peninsula so mix and match depending on weather and what you are up for that day.\n\nIf you have been to Croatia, let me know what I missed and what your favorites are!\n\nWe had the chance to put this itinerary to the test!\n\nCheck out all the blog posts about our trip to Croatia here!\n\nDon’t forget to check out all DESKRIB itineraries here!"}

Just don't start with Somalia.Swahili language - Wikipedia: Swahili, also known by its local name Kiswahili, is a Bantu language originally spoken by the Swahili people, who are found primarily in Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (along the East African coast and adjacent littoral islands).[6] Estimates of the number of Swahili speakers, including both native and second-language speakers, vary widely. They generally range from 150 million to 250 million;[7] with most of its native speakers residing in Tanzania and Kenya.\n\nSwahili has a significant number of loanwords from other languages, mainly Arabic, as well as from Portuguese, English and German. Around 40% of Swahili vocabulary consists of Arabic loanwords,[8] including the name of the language (سَوَاحِلي sawāḥilī, a plural adjectival form of an Arabic word meaning 'of the coasts'). The loanwords date from the era of contact between Arab traders and the Bantu inhabitants of the east coast of Africa, which was also the time period when Swahili emerged as a lingua franca in the region.[9]\n\nDue to concerted efforts by the government of Tanzania, Swahili is one of three official languages (the others being English and French) of the East African Community (EAC) countries, namely Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is the lingua franca of other areas in the African Great Lakes region and East and Southern Africa.[10][11][12] Swahili is also one of the working languages of the African Union and of the Southern African Development Community. The East African Community created an institution called the East African Kiswahili Commission (EAKC) which began operations in 2015. The institution currently serves as the leading body for promoting the language in the East African region, as well as for coordinating its development and usage for regional integration and sustainable development.[13] In recent years South Africa,[14] Botswana,[15] Namibia,[16] Ethiopia,[17] and South Sudan[18] have begun offering Swahili as a subject in schools or have developed plans to do so.\n\nShikomor (or Comorian), an official language in Comoros and also spoken in Mayotte (Shimaore), is closely related to Swahili and is sometimes considered a dialect of Swahili, although other authorities consider it a distinct language.[19][20] In 2022, based on Swahili's growth as a prominent international language, the United Nations declared Swahili Language Day as 7 July to commemorate the date that Julius Nyerere adopted Swahili as a unifying language for African independence struggles.[21]\n\nSwahili is a Bantu language of the Sabaki branch.[22] In Guthrie's geographic classification, Swahili is in Bantu zone G, whereas the other Sabaki languages are in zone E70, commonly under the name Nyika. Historical linguists consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant, since it takes around 15% of its vocabulary directly from Arabic, and was initially spread by Arab slave traders along the East African coast.[8][23][24]\n\nThe word `Swahili' comes from an Arabic name for the area, meaning \"coasts\":\n\nThe core of the Swahili language originates in Bantu languages of the coast of East Africa. Much of Swahili's Bantu vocabulary has cognates in the Unguja, Pemba, and Mijikenda languages[25] and, to a lesser extent, other East African Bantu languages. While opinions vary on the specifics, it has been historically purported that around 16–20% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from loan words, the vast majority Arabic, but also other contributing languages, including Persian, Hindustani, Portuguese, and Malay.[26]\n\nOmani Arabic is the source of most Arabic loanwords in Swahili.[28][29] In the text \"Early Swahili History Reconsidered\". However, Thomas Spear noted that Swahili retains a large amount of grammar, vocabulary, and sounds inherited from the Sabaki language. In fact, while taking account of daily vocabulary, using lists of one hundred words, 72–91% were inherited from the Sabaki language (which is reported as a parent language) whereas 4–17% were loan words from other African languages. Only 2–8% were from non-African languages, and Arabic loan words constituted a fraction of that.[30] According to other sources, around 40% of the Swahili vocabulary comes from Arabic.[8][31] What also remained unconsidered was that a good number of the borrowed terms had Bantu equivalents. The preferred use of Arabic loan words is prevalent along the coast, where local people, in a cultural show of proximity to, or descent from Arab culture, would rather use loan words, whereas the people in the interior tend to use the Bantu equivalents. It was originally written in Arabic script.[32]\n\nThe earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in Kilwa, Tanzania, in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies. The original letters are preserved in the Historical Archives of Goa, India.[33][34]\n\nVarious colonial powers that ruled on the coast of East Africa played a role in the growth and spread of Swahili. With the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as for teaching Islam to the local Bantu peoples. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic script. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the Berlin conference. After seeing there was already a widespread language, the Germans formalised it as the official language to be used in schools. Thus schools in Swahili are called Shule (from German Schule) in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili-speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the First World War, Britain took over German East Africa, where they found Swahili rooted in most areas, not just the coastal regions. The British decided to formalise it as the language to be used across the East African region (although in British East Africa [Kenya and Uganda] most areas used English and various Nilotic and other Bantu languages while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter-territorial conference attended by representatives of Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, and Zanzibar took place in Mombasa. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas,[36] and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.[37]\n\nEstimates of the total number of first- and second-language Swahili speakers vary widely, from as low as 50 million to as high as 200 million, but generally range from 60 million to 150 million.[7]\n\nSwahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions of people in the five African Great Lakes countries (Kenya, DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania), where it is an official or national language. It is also the first language for many people in Tanzania, especially in the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by other local languages and dialects. There, it is a first language for most of the people who are born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in Burundi, Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Rwanda.[38] The language was still understood in the southern ports of the Red Sea in the 20th century.[39][40] The East African Community created an institution called the East African Kiswahili Commission (EAKC) which began operations in 2015. The institution currently serves as the leading body for promoting the language in the East African region, as well as for coordinating its development and usage for regional integration and sustainable development.[13]\n\nSwahili is among the first languages in Africa for which language technology applications have been developed. Arvi Hurskainen is one of the early developers. The applications include a spelling checker,[41] part-of-speech tagging,[42] language learning software,[42] an analysed Swahili text corpus of 25 million words,[43] an electronic dictionary,[42] and machine translation[42] between Swahili and English. The development of language technology also strengthens the position of Swahili as a modern medium of communication.[44] Furthermore, Swahili Wikipedia is one of the few Wikipedias in an African language that features a substantial number of contributors and articles.\n\nThe widespread use of Swahili as a national language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika gained independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. This saw the use of Swahili in all levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children are taught in Swahili, before switching to English (medium of instruction)[45] in secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). After Tanganyika and Zanzibar unification in 1964, Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili (TUKI, Institute of Swahili Research) was created from the Interterritorial Language Committee. In 1970 TUKI was merged with the University of Dar es Salaam, while Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa (BAKITA) was formed. BAKITA is an organisation dedicated to the development and advocacy of Swahili as a means of national integration in Tanzania. Key activities mandated for the organisation include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organisations involved with Swahili, standardising the language. BAKITA vision are: \"1.To efficiently manage and coordinate the development and use of Kiswahili in Tanzania 2.To participate fully and effectively in promoting Swahili in East Africa, Africa and the entire world over\".[46] Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation that can approve its usage in the Swahili language. Tanzanians are highly credited for shaping the language to appear the way it is now.\n\nIn Kenya, Kiswahili has been the national language since 1964 and is official since 2010.[47] Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and promote Kiswahili language in Kenya.[48] Kiswahili is a compulsory subject in all Kenyan primary and secondary schools.[49]\n\nSwahili is recognized as a national language in the Democratic Republic of The Congo and is widely spoken in the eastern regions. The local dialects of Swahili in Congo are known as Congo Swahili and differ considerably from Standard Swahili.[50]\n\nIn order to strengthen political ties with other East African Community nations, both Kiswahili and English have been taught in Burundian elementary schools since the academic year 2005/2006. Kiswahili is now used widely in Burundi but is not recognised as an official language; only French, Kirundi, and English have this distinction.[51] Since 2013, Swahili has been included in the all Burundian education system.[52]\n\nUganda adopted Kiswahili as one of its official languages (alongside English) in 2022, and also made it compulsory across primary and secondary schools in the country.[53][47]\n\nThe Somali language is the national and primary first language of Somalia.[54] The Swahili language is not widespread in Somalia and has no official status nationally or regionally.[54] Dialects of Swahili are spoken by some ethnic minorities on the Bajuni islands in the form of Kibajuni on the southern tip of the country and in the town of Brava in the form of Chimwiini; both contain a significant amount of Somali and Italian loanwords.[55][56] Standard Swahili is generally only spoken by Somali nationals who have resided in Kenya and subsequently returned to Somalia.[57][58] Lastly, a closely related language Mushunguli (also known as Zigula, Zigua, or Chizigua) is spoken by some of the Somali Bantu ethnic minority mostly living in the Jubba Valley.[59] It is classified as a Northeast Coast Bantu language as Swahili is[60] and has some intelligibility with Swahili.\n\nIn 2024, Somalia joined the East African Community and its inclusion may facilitate the spread of the Swahili language in Somalia.[61] Nevertheless, in Somalia, Swahili, as a foreign language, will have to compete with English; the primary global lingua franca, Arabic; the official second language of Somalia and a liturgical language for Muslims,[54] as popular secondary or tertiary languages. Consequently, there is significant uncertainty regarding the adoption of the Swahili language in Somalia compared to the situation in most other EAC member states.\n\nSwahili played a major role in spreading both Christianity and Islam in East Africa. From their arrival in East Africa, Arabs brought Islam and set up madrasas, where they used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab presence grew, more and more natives converted to Islam and were taught using the Swahili language.\n\nFrom the arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced to the region. While the Arabs were mostly based in the coastal areas, European missionaries went further inland spreading Christianity. As the first missionary posts in East Africa were in the coastal areas, missionaries picked up Swahili and used it to spread Christianity, since it contained many similarities with other indigenous languages in the region.\n\nDuring the struggle for Tanganyika independence, the Tanganyika African National Union used Swahili as a language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After gaining independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language. To this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili, especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity within the nation, and remains to be a key identity of the Tanzanian people.\n\nStandard Swahili has five vowel phonemes: /ɑ/, /ɛ/, /i/, /ɔ/, and /u/. According to Ellen Contini-Morava, vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress.[62] However, according to Edgar Polomé, these five phonemes can vary in pronunciation. Polomé claims that /ɛ/, /i/, /ɔ/, and /u/ are pronounced as such only in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, as well as before a prenasalized consonant, they are pronounced as [e], [ɪ], [o], and [ʊ]. E is also commonly pronounced as mid-position after w. Polomé claims that /ɑ/ is pronounced as such only after w and is pronounced as [a] in other situations, especially after /j/ (y). A can be pronounced as [ə] in word-final position.[63] Long vowels in Swahili are written as doubled vowels (for example, kondoo, \"sheep\") due to a historical process in which /l/ became elided between the second last and last vowels of a word (for example, kondoo, \"sheep\" was originally kondolo, which survives in certain dialects[which?]). As a consequence, long vowels are not considered phonemic. A similar process exists in Zulu.\n\nWhere not shown, the orthography is the same as IPA.\n\nSome dialects of Swahili may also have the aspirated phonemes /pʰ tʰ tʃʰ kʰ bʱ dʱ dʒʱ ɡʱ/ though they are unmarked in Swahili's orthography.[65] Multiple studies favour classifying prenasalization as consonant clusters, not as separate phonemes. Historically, nasalization has been lost before voiceless consonants, and subsequently the voiced consonants have devoiced,[citation needed] though they are still written mb, nd etc. The /r/ phoneme is realised as either a short trill [r] or more commonly as a single tap [ɾ] by most speakers. [x] exists in free variation with h, and is only distinguished by some speakers.[63] In some Arabic loans (nouns, verbs, adjectives), emphasis or intensity is expressed by reproducing the original emphatic consonants /dˤ, sˤ, tˤ, ðˤ/ and the uvular /q/, or lengthening a vowel, where aspiration would be used in inherited Bantu words.[65]\n\nSwahili is now written in the Latin alphabet. There are a few digraphs for native sounds, ch, sh, ng' and ny; q and x are not used,[66] c is not used apart from the digraph ch, unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for k in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds, which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.\n\nThe language used to be primarily written in the Ajami script, which is an Arabic script. Much literature was produced in this script. With the introduction of Latin, the use of Ajami script has been diminished significantly. However, the language continues to have a tradition of being written in Arabic script.[67] Starting from the later half of the 19th century, continuing into the 20th century, and going on in the 21st century, a process of \"Swahilization\" of the Arabic Script has been underway by Swahili scribes and scholars. The first of such attempts was done by Mwalimu Sikujua, a scholar and poet from Mombasa.[68] However, the spread of a standardized indigenous variation of Arabic script for Swahili was hampered by the colonial takeover of East Africa by the United Kingdom and Germany. The usage of Arabic script was suppressed in German East Africa and to a lesser extent in British East Africa. Nevertheless, well into the 1930s and 1940s, rural literacy rate in Arabic script as well as a local preference to write Swahili in the Arabic script (an unmodified version as opposed to proposals such as that of Mwalimu Sikujua) was relatively high.[68] There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility. Thus despite a lack of official governmental backing, attempts at standardization and Swahilization of the Arabic script continued into the 20th century.\n\nSwahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to genders in other languages. In Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: ⟨m-⟩ marks single human beings (mtoto 'child'), ⟨wa-⟩ marks multiple humans (watoto 'children'), ⟨u-⟩ marks abstract nouns (utoto 'childhood'), and so on. And just as adjectives and pronouns must agree with the gender of nouns in some languages with grammatical gender, so in Swahili adjectives, pronouns and even verbs must agree with nouns. This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages.\n\nThe ki-/vi- class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are kisu \"knife\", kiti \"chair\" (from mti \"tree, wood\"), chombo \"vessel\" (a contraction of ki-ombo). Examples of the latter are kitoto \"infant\", from mtoto \"child\"; kitawi \"frond\", from tawi \"branch\"; and chumba (ki-umba) \"room\", from nyumba \"house\". It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is approximation and resemblance (having a 'little bit' of some characteristic, like -y or -ish in English). For example, there is kijani \"green\", from jani \"leaf\" (compare English 'leafy'), kichaka \"bush\" from chaka \"clump\", and kivuli \"shadow\" from uvuli \"shade\". A 'little bit' of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such instantiations (usually not very active ones) are found: kifo \"death\", from the verb -fa \"to die\"; kiota \"nest\" from -ota \"to brood\"; chakula \"food\" from kula \"to eat\"; kivuko \"a ford, a pass\" from -vuka \"to cross\"; and kilimia \"the Pleiades\", from -limia \"to farm with\", from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the ki-/vi- prefixes. One example is chura (ki-ura) \"frog\", which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: kilema \"a cripple\", kipofu \"a blind person\", kiziwi \"a deaf person\". Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for kifaru \"rhinoceros\", kingugwa \"spotted hyena\", and kiboko \"hippopotamus\" (perhaps originally meaning \"stubby legs\").[69]\n\nAnother class with broad semantic extension is the m-/mi- class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the 'tree' class, because mti, miti \"tree(s)\" is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as mwitu 'forest' and mtama 'millet' (and from there, things made from plants, like mkeka 'mat'); supernatural and natural forces, such as mwezi 'moon', mlima 'mountain', mto 'river'; active things, such as moto 'fire', including active body parts (moyo 'heart', mkono 'hand, arm'); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as mji 'village', and, by analogy, mzinga 'beehive/cannon'. From the central idea of tree, which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as mwavuli 'umbrella', moshi 'smoke', msumari 'nail'; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as mfuo \"metal forging\", from -fua \"to forge\", or mlio \"a sound\", from -lia \"to make a sound\". Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, mkono is an active body part, and mto is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as mpaka 'border' and mwendo 'journey', are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as mwaka 'year' and perhaps mshahara 'wages'. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.\n\nThe other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive.[70] In short,\n• Classes 1–2 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in -er. They include a couple of generic words for animals: mnyama 'beast', mdudu 'bug'.\n• Classes 5–6 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:\n• Augmentatives, such as joka 'serpent' from nyoka 'snake', lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): Bwana 'Sir', shangazi 'aunt', fundi 'craftsman', kadhi 'judge'\n• Expanses: ziwa 'lake', bonde 'valley', taifa 'country', anga 'sky'\n• from this, mass nouns: maji 'water', vumbi 'dust' (and other liquids and fine particulates that may cover broad expanses), kaa 'charcoal', mali 'wealth', maridhawa 'abundance'\n• Collectives: kundi 'group', kabila 'language/ethnic group', jeshi 'army', daraja ' stairs', manyoya 'fur, feathers', mapesa 'small change', manyasi 'weeds', jongoo 'millipede' (large set of legs), marimba 'xylophone' (large set of keys)\n• from this, individual things found in groups: jiwe 'stone', tawi 'branch', ua 'flower', tunda 'fruit' (also the names of most fruits), yai 'egg', mapacha 'twins', jino 'tooth', tumbo 'stomach' (cf. English \"guts\"), and paired body parts such as jicho 'eye', bawa 'wing', etc.\n• also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: neno 'a word', from kunena 'to speak' (and by extension, mental verbal processes: wazo 'thought', maana 'meaning'); pigo 'a stroke, blow', from kupiga 'to hit'; gomvi 'a quarrel', shauri 'advice, plan', kosa 'mistake', jambo 'affair', penzi 'love', jibu 'answer', agano 'promise', malipo 'payment'\n• From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above\n• Classes 9–10 are used for most typical animals: ndege 'bird', samaki 'fish', and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the 'other' class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9–10 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9–10 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9–10 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.\n• Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an \"extended outline shape\", in either one dimension or two:\n• mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: uji 'porridge', wali 'cooked rice'\n• long: utambi 'wick', utepe 'stripe', uta 'bow', ubavu 'rib', ufa 'crack', unywele 'a hair'\n• from 'a hair', singulatives of nouns, which are often class 6 ('collectives') in the plural: unyoya 'a feather', uvumbi 'a mote of dust', ushanga 'a bead'.\n• Class 14 are abstractions, such as utoto 'childhood' (from mtoto 'a child') and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.\n• Classes 16–18 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan mahali 'place(s)', but in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: pahali 'place', mwahali 'places'. However, any noun with the locative suffix -ni takes class 16–18 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite (\"at\"), class 17 if indefinite (\"around\") or involves motion (\"to, toward\"), and class 18 if it involves containment (\"within\"): mahali pazuri 'a good spot', mahali kuzuri 'a nice area', mahali muzuri (it's nice in there).\n\nBorrowings may or may not be given a prefix corresponding to the semantic class they fall in. For example, Arabic دود dūd (\"bug, insect\") was borrowed as mdudu, plural wadudu, with the class 1/2 prefixes m- and wa-, but Arabic فلوس fulūs (\"fish scales\", plural of فلس fals) and English sloth were borrowed as simply fulusi (\"mahi-mahi\" fish) and slothi (\"sloth\"), with no prefix associated with animals (whether those of class 9/10 or 1/2).\n\nIn the process of naturalization[71] of borrowings within Swahili, loanwords are often reinterpreted, or reanalysed,[72] as if they already contain a Swahili class prefix. In such cases the interpreted prefix is changed with the usual rules. Consider the following loanwords from Arabic:\n• The Swahili word for \"book\", kitabu, is borrowed from Arabic kitāb(un) \"book\" (plural kutub; from the Arabic root k.t.b. \"write\"). However, the Swahili plural form of this word (\"books\") is vitabu, following Bantu grammar in which the ki- of kitabu is reanalysed (reinterpreted) as a nominal class prefix whose plural is vi- (class 7/8). 72\n• Arabic muʿallim(un) (\"teacher\", plural muʿallimīna) was interpreted as having the mw- prefix of class 1, and so became mwalimu, plural walimu.\n• Arabic madrasa school, even though it is singular in Arabic (with plural madāris), was reinterpreted as a class 6 plural madarasa, receiving the singular form darasa.\n\nSimilarly, English wire and Arabic وقت waqt (\"time\") were interpreted as having the class 11 prevocalic prefix w-, and became waya and wakati with plural nyaya and nyakati respectively.\n\nSwahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of concord but, if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1–2 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili (Kiswahili sanifu), based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger a-, wa- and m-, wa- in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger i-, zi-. Infinitives vary between standard ku- and reduced i-.[73] (\"Of\" is animate wa and inanimate ya, za.)\n\nIn Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in a-, wa- and m-, wa-, and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.\n\nThis list is based on Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history.\n\nModern standard Swahili, written in Latin, is based on Kiunguja, the dialect spoken in Zanzibar City.[74]\n\nSwahili literature and poetry, traditionally written in Swahili Ajami, is based on Kiamu, the dialect of Lamu on the Kenyan Coast.[75][67]\n\nBut there are numerous other dialects of Swahili, some of which are mutually unintelligible, such as the following:[74]\n\nMaho (2009) considers these to be distinct languages:\n• Kimwani is spoken in the Kerimba Islands and northern coastal Mozambique.\n• Chimwiini is spoken by the ethnic minorities in and around the town of Barawa on the southern coast of Somalia.\n• Kibajuni is spoken by the Bajuni minority ethnic group on the coast and islands on both sides of the Somali–Kenyan border and in the Bajuni Islands (the northern part of the Lamu archipelago) and is also called Kitikuu and Kigunya.\n\nThe rest of the dialects are divided by him[citation needed] into two groups:\n• Mombasa–Lamu Swahili\n• Lamu\n• The dialects of the Lamu group (especially Kiamu, Kipate, Kingozi) are the linguistic base of the oldest ( ) Swahili manuscripts and poems that reached us. 75 They are sometimes described as \"literary\" dialects but they were also used for everyday life and are still spoken today except Kingozi.\n• Kiamu 76 is spoken in and around the island of Lamu (Amu) and have an important corpus 77 of classical poems of the 18st and 19st centuries written in Arabic script (Kiajemi).\n• Kipate is a local dialect of Pate Island, considered[ ] to be closest to the original dialect of Kingozi[ ]. It has also an important classical corpus 77 of poems from the 18st and 19st centuries.\n• Kingozi is an extinct dialect spoken on the Indian Ocean coast between Lamu and Somalia and is sometimes still[ ] used in poetry. It is often considered[ ] the source of Swahili[ ]. Academic theories about Kingozi as an old literary dialect are conflicting. It is sometimes linked to the epics of Liongo. For Sacleux, 78 it's and old and \"an exclusively literary, arcane dialect\". It varies depending on the authors whose will to return to a pure form of the old language make them use Kigunya mainly (Kipate is a subdialect of Kigunya) and secondarily Kiamu and Kimvita. Knappert, 79 on the contrary, states the existence of a literary koine in the 18th century based on the Kingozi as a prestigious and widespread dialect. The 2009 New Updated Guthrie List, a referential classification of the Bantu languages, considers kiOzi as a dialect in itself. 80 It is not the ancestor language of Kiswahili but a member of the Lamu group (code G42a) with Kiamu, Kipate and Kisiu. This brief overview indicates that the state of research is fragmented and uncertain on the history of the kingozi.\n• Mombasa\n• Chijomvu is a subdialect of the Mombasa area.\n• Kimvita is the major dialect of Mombasa (also known as \"Mvita\", which means \"war\", in reference[ ] to the many wars which were fought over it, the other major dialect alongside Kiunguja. It has an important classical corpus written in Arabic script from the 18st and 19st century. 81\n• Kingare is the subdialect of the Mombasa area.\n• Kimrima is spoken around Pangani, Vanga, Dar es Salaam, Rufiji and Mafia Island.\n• Kiunguja is spoken in Zanzibar City and environs on Unguja (Zanzibar) Island. Kitumbatu (Pemba) dialects occupy the bulk of the island.\n• Pemba Swahili\n• Kipemba is a local dialect of the Pemba Island.\n• Kitumbatu and Kimakunduchi are the countryside dialects of the island of Zanzibar. Kimakunduchi is a recent renaming of \"Kihadimu\"; the old name means \"serf\" and so is considered pejorative.\n• Kimgao used to be spoken around Kilwa District and to the south.\n\nMaho includes the various Comorian dialects as a third group. Most other authorities consider Comorian to be a Sabaki language, distinct from Swahili.[82]\n\nIn Somalia, where the Afroasiatic Somali language predominates, a variant of Swahili referred to as Chimwiini (also known as Chimbalazi) is spoken along the Benadir coast by the Bravanese people.[83] Another Swahili dialect known as Kibajuni also serves as the mother tongue of the Bajuni minority ethnic group, which lives in the tiny Bajuni Islands as well as the southern Kismayo region.[84][85]\n\nIn Oman, there are an estimated 52,000 people who speak Swahili as of 2020.[86] Most are descendants of those repatriated after the fall of the Sultanate of Zanzibar.[87][88]\n\nThere are Swahili-based slangs, pidgins and creoles:\n• Engsh – Cant from the rich neighbourhoods of Nairobi, Kenya\n\nIn 1870, Edward Steere published Swahili Tales as Told by Natives of Zanzibar, a collection of 23 Swahili tales with facing-text English translation, along with a selection of proverbs and riddles.[91] Some of the tales included are: \"Kisa cha Punda wa Dobi,\"[92] \"The Story of the Washerman's Donkey,\" also known as \"The Heart of a Monkey;\" \"Mwalimu Goso,\"[93] \"Goso the Teacher,\" a cumulative tale; and \"Sungura na Simba,\"[94] \"The Hare and the Lion,\" a story about the trickster hare.\n\nHere are some of the proverbs that Steere recorded in Swahili:[95]\n• \"Mbio za sakafuni hwishia ukingoni.\" \"Running on a roof ends at the edge of it.\"\n• \"Angurumapo simba, mteza nani?\" \"Who will dance to a lion's roaring?\"\n• \"Mlevi wa mvinyo hulevuka, mlevi wa mali halevuki.\" \"He that is drunk with wine gets sober, he that is drunk with wealth does not.\"\n• \"Kikulacho kinguoni mwako.\" \"What bites is in your own clothes.\"\n\nHere are some of the riddles that Steere recorded in Swahili:[96]\n• \"Nyumba yangu kubwa, haina mlango (yayi).\" \"My house is large; it has no door (egg).\"\n• \"Kuku wangu akazalia miibani (nanasi).\" \"My hen has laid among thorns (pineapple).\"\n\nSteere also includes the formulaic announcement of a riddle:\n\nAn anonymous publication from 1881, Swahili Stories from Arab Sources with an English Translation, includes 15 stories in Swahili with English translations, plus an additional 14 Swahili stories that are not translated. There is also a selection of proverbs and riddles with English translations.[97]\n\nHere are some of the proverbs:[98]\n• \"Tulingane sawasawa, kama sahani na kawa.\" \"We match together, like a dish and a cover.\"\n• \"Samaki mmoja akioza, wameoza wote.\" \"If one fish is bad, they are all bad.\"\n• \"Wa kuume haukati wa kushoto.\" \"The right hand does not cut the left.\"\n• \"Paka akiondoka, panya hutawala.\" \"When the cat goes away, the rat is king.\"\n\nHere are some of the riddles:[99]\n• \"Gumugumu huzaa teketeke, gumugumu teketeke huzaa (mahindi).\" \"The hard is the parent of the soft, and the soft of the hard (maize).\"\n• \"Mtoto wangu killa mwaka hulala chini (boga).\" \"My child each year lies on the ground (pumpkin).\"\n• \"Nyumba vangu kubwa haina taa (kaburi).\" \"My great house has no lamp (grave).\"\n• \"Nimetupa mshale wangu, mchana kwenda mbali nikitupa usiku hauendi mbali (macho).\" \"I cast my arrow in the day time, it went far off; it I cast it at night, it does not go far (eyes).\"\n\nFor additional collections of Swahili prose from the 19th century, see the inventory in J.

It borders Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, Guinea to the southeast and Guinea-Bissau to the southwest. Senegal nearly surrounds The Gambia, a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the Gambia River, which separates Senegal's southern region of Casamance from the rest of the country.[12][13] It also shares a maritime border with Cape Verde. Senegal's economic and political capital is Dakar.\n\nSenegal is the westernmost country in the mainland of the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia.[14] It owes its name to the Senegal River, which borders it to the east and north.[15] The climate is typically Sahelian, though there is a rainy season. Senegal covers a land area of almost 197,000 square kilometres (76,000 sq mi) and has a population of around 18 million.[16][17] The state is a unitary presidential republic; since the country's foundation in 1960, it has been recognized as one of the most stable countries on the African continent.[18] On the 2023 V-Dem Democracy Indices, Senegal is ranked 52nd in electoral democracy worldwide and 4th in electoral democracy in Africa.[19]\n\nThe state was formed as part of the independence of French West Africa from French colonial rule. Because of this history, French is the official language, but it is understood by only a minority of the population.[20] Over 30 languages are spoken in Senegal. Wolof is the most widely spoken one, with 80% of the population speaking it as a first or second language,[21] acting as Senegal's lingua franca alongside French. Like other African nations, the country includes a wide mix of ethnic and linguistic communities, with the largest being the Wolof, Fula, and Serer people. Senegalese people are predominantly Muslim.[22]\n\nSenegal is classified as a heavily indebted poor country, with a relatively low ranking on the Human Development Index (169th out of 193). Most of the population lives on the coast and works in agriculture or other food industries; other major industries include mining, tourism, and services.[23] The country does not have notable natural resources, but the basis of its development lies in education,[clarify] where almost half the state's budget is spent.[24] Senegal is a member state of the African Union, the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States. In the world of motor sports, Senegal is known for the Paris–Dakar Rally.[25]\n\nThe country of Senegal is named after the Senegal River. The name of the river may derive from a Portuguese transliteration of the name of the Zenaga, also known as the Sanhaja.[26] Alternatively, it could be a combination of the supreme deity in Serer religion (Rog Sene) and o gal meaning body of water in the Serer language. French author and priest David Boilat put forward the theory that the name derives from the Wolof phrase \"sunuu gaal\", which means \"our canoe\".[27]\n\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the seventh century: Takrur in the sixth century, Namandiru and the Jolof Empire during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the Ghana Empire.\n\nIslam was introduced through Toucouleur and Soninke contact with the Almoravid dynasty of the Maghreb, who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.[28][29]\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was enslaved, typically as a result of being taken captive in warfare.[30]\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united Cayor and the kingdoms of Baol, Siné, Saloum, Waalo, Futa Tooro and Bambouk, or much of present-day West Africa. The empire was a voluntary confederacy of various states rather than being built on military conquest.[31][32] The empire was founded by Ndiadiane Ndiaye, a part Serer[33][34] and part Toucouleur, who was able to form a coalition with many ethnicities, but collapsed around 1549 with the defeat and killing of Lele Fouli Fak by Amari Ngone Sobel Fall.\n\nIn the mid-15th century, the Portuguese landed on the Senegal coastline, followed by traders representing other countries, including the French.[35] Various European powers—Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain—competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward.\n\nIn 1677, France gained control of what had become a minor departure point in the Atlantic slave trade: the island of Gorée next to modern Dakar, used as a base to purchase slaves from the warring chiefdoms on the mainland.[36][37]\n\nEuropean missionaries introduced Christianity to Senegal and the Casamance in the 19th century. It was only in the 1850s that the French began to expand onto the Senegalese mainland, after they abolished slavery and began promoting an abolitionist doctrine,[38] adding native kingdoms like the Waalo, Cayor, Baol, and Jolof. French colonists under Governor Louis Faidherbe progressively invaded and took over all the kingdoms, except the Serer Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum.[31][39]\n\nYoro Dyao was in command of the canton of Foss-Galodjina and was set over Wâlo (Ouâlo) by Louis Faidherbe,[40] where he served as a chief from 1861 to 1914.[41] Senegalese resistance to the French expansion was led in part by Lat-Dior, Damel of Cayor, and Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof (the Maad a Sinig, King of Sine), resulting in the famous Battle of Logandème―the battle in which the Serer King of Sine went to war against the mighty French colonial empire, where the French decided to take revenge against Sine following their humiliating defeat at the Battle of Djilor. The Battle of Logandème was the first battle on Senegambian soil where the French decided to employ cannonball.[42][43][44][45]\n\nIn 1915, over 300 Senegalese came under Australian command, ahead of the taking of Damascus by Australians, before the expected arrival of the famed Lawrence of Arabia. French and British diplomacy in the area were thrown into disarray.[citation needed]\n\nThe Battle of Dakar (23–25 September 1940) was an unsuccessful attempt by the Allies to capture the strategic port and overthrow the pro-German Vichy French administration in the colony.[46]\n\nOn 25 November 1958, Senegal became an autonomous republic within the French Community.[47]\n\nIn January 1959, Senegal and the French Sudan merged to form the Mali Federation, which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August 1960 when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of Mali) each proclaimed independence.\n\nLéopold Sédar Senghor was elected Senegal's first president in August 1960. Pro-African, Senghor advocated a brand of African socialism.[48]\n\nAfter the breakup of the Mali Federation, Senghor and Prime Minister Mamadou Dia governed together under a parliamentary system. In December 1962, their political rivalry led to an attempted coup by Dia. The coup was put down without bloodshed and Dia was arrested and imprisoned. Senegal adopted a new constitution that consolidated the President's power.\n\nSenghor was considerably more tolerant of opposition than most African leaders became in the 1960s. Nonetheless, political activity was somewhat restricted for a time. Senghor's party, the Senegalese Progressive Union (now the Socialist Party of Senegal), was the only legally permitted party from 1965 until 1975. In the latter year, Senghor allowed the formation of two opposition parties that began operation in 1976—a Marxist party (the African Independence Party) and a liberal party (the Senegalese Democratic Party).\n\nThe 1960s and early 1970s saw the continued and persistent violating of Senegal's borders by the Portuguese military from Portuguese Guinea. In response, Senegal petitioned the United Nations Security Council in 1963, 1965, 1969 (in response to shelling by Portuguese artillery), 1971 and finally in 1972.\n\nIn 1980, Senghor decided to retire from politics. The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, Abdou Diouf. Former prime minister Mamadou Dia, who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 95.\n\nIn the 1980s, Boubacar Lam discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the Tuculor noble, Yoro Dyâo, not long after World War I, which documented migrations into West Africa from the Nile Valley; ethnic groups, from the Senegal River to the Niger Delta, retained traditions of having an eastern origin.[49]\n\nSenegal joined with The Gambia to form the nominal Senegambia Confederation on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group (Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance or MFDC) in the Casamance region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the Casamance conflict. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President Macky Sall held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.[50]\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nDuring the Gulf War, over 500 Senegalese participated in the Battle of Khafji and the unexpected Liberation of Kuwait campaign, under the command of the U.S.-led coalition.[citation needed]\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\nIn March 2012, the incumbent president Abdoulaye Wade lost the presidential election and Macky Sall was elected as the new President of Senegal.[51] President Macky Sall was re-elected in 2019 elections. The presidential term was reduced from seven years to five.[52]\n\nSince 3 March 2021, Senegal has been rocked by a series of mass protests in response to the arrest of Ousmane Sonko for alleged rape and mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2023, the response to the protests turned increasingly violent, with Amnesty International counting 23 fatalities, most of which were caused by bullets fired by police or armed police collaborators.[53]\n\nIn March 2024, Opposition candidate Bassirou Diomaye Faye won the Senegal's presidential election over candidate of the ruling coalition, becoming the youngest president in Senegal's history.[54] In November 2024 Faye announced that France will withdraw its troops from Senegal and close its bases by the end of 2025.[55][56]\n\nSenegal is a republic with a presidency; the president is elected every five years as of 2016, previously being seven years from independence to 2001, five years from 2001 to 2008, and seven years again from 2008 to 2016, by adult voters. The first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the Académie française. Senegal's second president, Abdou Diouf, later served as general secretary of the Organisation de la Francophonie. The third president was Abdoulaye Wade, a lawyer. The fourth president was Macky Sall, elected in March 2012 and reelected in February 2019.[57] On 25 March 2024, Bassirou Diomaye Faye became the fifth democratically elected president.[58]\n\nSenegal has more than 80 political parties. The unicameral parliament consists of the National Assembly, which has 150 seats (a Senate was in place from 1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2012).[6] An independent judiciary also exists in Senegal. The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.\n\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. Marabouts, religious leaders of the various Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, Freedom House downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive. By 2014, it had recovered its Free status.[59]\n\nIn 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the Ibrahim Index of African Governance.[60] The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance (limited to sub-Saharan Africa until 2008), based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens. When the Northern African countries were added to the index in 2009, Senegal's 2008 position was retroactively downgraded to 15th place (with Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco placing ahead of Senegal). As of 2012 , Senegal's Ibrahim Index rank has declined another point to 16th of 52 African countries.\n\nOn 22 February 2011, Senegal severed diplomatic ties with Iran, saying it supplied rebels with weapons which killed Senegalese troops in the Casamance conflict.[61]\n\nThe 2012 presidential election was controversial due to President Wade's candidacy, as the opposition argued he should not be considered eligible to run again. Several youth opposition movements, including M23 and Y'en a Marre, emerged in June 2011. In the end, Macky Sall of the Alliance for the Republic won, and Wade conceded the election to Sall. This peaceful and democratic transition was hailed by many foreign observers, such as the EU[62] as a show of \"maturity\".\n\nOn 19 September 2012, lawmakers voted to do away with the Senate to save an estimated $15 million.[63]\n\nIn August 2017, the ruling party won a landslide victory in the parliamentary election. President Macky Sall's ruling coalition took 125 seats in the 165-seat National Assembly.[64] In 2019 president Macky Sall easily won re-election in the first round.[65] On 2 April 2024, his successor Bassirou Diomaye Faye was sworn in.[66]\n\nSenegal has been one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution.[67][68] As a result, in 1968, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.[69] Léopold Sédar Senghor, then president of Senegal signed the agreement to convene a World Constituent Assembly.[70]\n\nSenegal is subdivided into 14 regions,[71] each administered by a Conseil Régional (Regional Council) elected by population weight at the Arrondissement level. The country is further subdivided by 45 Départements, 113 Arrondissements (neither of which have administrative function) and by Collectivités Locales, which elect administrative officers.[72]\n\nRegional capitals have the same name as their respective regions:\n\nSenegal has a high profile in many international organizations and was a member of the UN Security Council in 1988–89 and 2015–2016. It was elected to the UN Commission on Human Rights in 1997. Friendly to the West, especially to the United States, Senegal has vigorously advocated for more assistance from developed countries to the Third World. The Foreign Minister of Senegal is Aïssata Tall Sall. She took office in November 2020.\n\nHistorically, Senegal has been close to France, its former colonizer, but this had caused a great amount of tension with the people and was one of the reasons why former President Macky Sall lost support. Senegalese often complained that Sall was consistently giving French companies priority contracts to extract Senegal's natural resources rather than giving the contracts to whoever offered Senegal the best deal. They also believed France was pushing Macky Sall to run for an unconstitutional third term. After debating whether to run a third time for months, Sall did not.[73]\n\nSenegal enjoys mostly cordial relations with its neighbors. In spite of clear progress on other issues with Mauritania (border security, resource management, economic integration, etc.), an estimated 35,000 Mauritanian refugees (of the estimated 40,000 who were expelled from their home country in 1989) remain in Senegal.[74]Morocco–Senegal relations have also been courteous, as the new Bassirou Diomaye Faye invited the king of Morocco on his swearing ceremony in 2024.\n\nSenegal is well integrated with the main bodies of the international community, including the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the African Union (AU), and the Community of Sahel–Saharan States.\n\nSenegal is the 84th most peaceful country in the world, according to the 2024 Global Peace Index.[75]\n\nThe Armed Forces of Senegal consist of about 17,000 personnel in the army, air force, navy, and gendarmerie. The Senegalese military receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States, and to a lesser extent Germany.\n\nMilitary non interference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the Democratic Republic of Congo to participate in MONUC, the United Nations peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a US-trained battalion to Sierra Leone for UNAMSIL, another UN peacekeeping mission.\n\nIn 2015, Senegal participated in the Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis.[76]\n\nSenegal is a secular state, as defined in its Constitution.[77]\n\nTo fight corruption, the government has created the National Anti-Corruption Office (OFNAC) and the Commission of Restitution and Recovery of Illegally Acquired Assets. According to Business Anti-Corruption Portal, President Sall created the OFNAC to replace the Commission Nationale de Lutte Contre la non-Transparence, la Corruption et la Concussion (CNLCC). It is said that the OFNAC represents a more effective tool for fighting corruption than the CNLCC established under former President Wade.[78] The mission of OFNAC is to fight corruption, embezzlement of public funds and fraud. OFNAC has the power of self-referral (own initiative investigation). OFNAC is composed of twelve members appointed by decree.\n\nHomosexuality is illegal in Senegal.[79] According to 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center, 96% of Senegalese believe that homosexuality should not be accepted by society.[80] LGBTQ community members in Senegal report a strong feeling of being unsafe.[81]\n\nSenegal is located on the west of the African continent. It lies between latitudes 12° and 17°N, and longitudes 11° and 18°W.\n\nSenegal is externally bounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, Mauritania to the north, Mali to the east, and Guinea and Guinea-Bissau to the south; internally it almost completely surrounds The Gambia, namely on the north, east and south, except for Gambia's short Atlantic coastline.\n\nThe Senegalese landscape consists mainly of the rolling sandy plains of the western Sahel which rise to foothills in the southeast. Here is also found Senegal's highest point, Baunez ridge situated 2.7 km southeast of Nepen Diakha at 648 m (2,126 ft).[82] The northern border is formed by the Senegal River; other rivers include the Gambia and Casamance Rivers. The capital Dakar lies on the Cap-Vert peninsula, the westernmost point of continental Africa.\n\nThe Cape Verde islands lie some 560 kilometres (350 mi) off the Senegalese coast, but Cap-Vert (\"Cape Green\") is a maritime placemark, set at the foot of \"Les Mammelles\", a 105-metre (344 ft) cliff resting at one end of the Cap-Vert peninsula onto which is settled Senegal's capital Dakar, and 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) south of the \"Pointe des Almadies\", the westernmost point in Africa.\n\nSenegal contains four terrestrial ecoregions: Guinean forest-savanna mosaic, Sahelian Acacia savanna, West Sudanian savanna, and Guinean mangroves.[83] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.11/10, ranking it 56th globally out of 172 countries.[84]\n\nSenegal has a tropical climate with pleasant heat throughout the year with well-defined dry and humid seasons that result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds. The dry season (December to April) is dominated by hot, dry, harmattan wind.[6] Dakar's annual rainfall of about 600 mm (24 in) occurs between June and October when maximum temperatures average 30 °C (86.0 °F) and minimums 24.2 °C (75.6 °F); December to February maximum temperatures average 25.7 °C (78.3 °F) and minimums 18 °C (64.4 °F).[85]\n\nInterior temperatures are higher than along the coast (for example, average daily temperatures in Kaolack and Tambacounda for May are 30 °C (86.0 °F) and 32.7 °C (90.9 °F) respectively, compared to Dakar's 23.2 °C (73.8 °F) ),[86] and rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding 1,500 mm (59.1 in) annually in some areas.\n\nIn Tambacounda in the far interior, particularly on the border of Mali where desert begins, temperatures can reach as high as 54 °C (129.2 °F). The northernmost part of the country is the Lompoul desert that has a near hot desert climate, the central part has a hot semi-arid climate and the southernmost part has a tropical wet and dry climate. Senegal is mainly a sunny and dry country.\n\nThe main industries include food processing, mining, cement, artificial fertilizer, chemicals, textiles, refining imported petroleum, and tourism. Exports include fish, chemicals, cotton, fabrics, groundnuts, and calcium phosphate. The largest export markets as of 2020 are Mali (20.4%), Switzerland (12.2%), and India (8.3%).[96]\n\nAs a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external tariff. Senegal is also a member of the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa.[97]\n\nSenegal achieved full Internet connectivity in 1996, creating a mini-boom in information technology-based services. Private activity now accounts for 82 percent of its GDP. On the negative side, Senegal faces deep-seated urban problems of chronic high unemployment.[98]\n\nSenegal is a major recipient of international development assistance. Donors include the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Japan, France and China. Over 4,000 Peace Corps Volunteers have served in Senegal since 1963.[99]\n\nSenegal has a 12-nautical-mile (22 km; 14 mi) exclusive fishing zone that has been regularly breached in recent years (as of 2014 ). It has been estimated that the country's fishermen lose 300,000 tonnes of fish each year to illegal fishing. The Senegalese government have tried to control the illegal fishing which is conducted by fishing trawlers, some of which are registered in Russia, Mauritania, Belize and Ukraine. In January 2014, a Russian trawler, Oleg Naydenov, was seized by Senegalese authorities close to the maritime border with Guinea-Bissau.[102]\n\nSenegal has a population of around 18 million, about 42 percent of whom live in rural areas. Density in these areas varies from about 77 inhabitants per square kilometre (200/sq mi) in the west-central region to 2 per square kilometre (5.2/sq mi) in the arid eastern section.\n\nSenegal ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, as well as the additional protocol. Senegal is also a signatory of the African Charter of Human and People's Rights, which was adopted during the 2003 African Union Summit. However, feminists have been critical of the government's lack of action in enforcing the protocols, conventions and other texts that have been signed as a means of protecting women's rights.[citation needed]\n\nSenegal has a wide variety of ethnic groups and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken. According to \"CIA World Factbook: Senegal\" (2019 estimates), the ethnic groups are Wolof (39%); Fula (probably including the Halpulaar speaking Toucouleur) (27.5%); Serer group (probably including the Serer Cangin peoples) (16%); Mandinka (4.9%); Jola (4.2%); Soninke (2.4%); other 5.4% (includes Europeans and persons of Lebanese descent), and other minor ethnic groups like the Bassari, Maures or (Naarkajors).[105]\n\nThere are also tens of thousands of Mauritanian refugees in Senegal, primarily in the country's north.[106]\n\nAccording to the World Refugee Survey 2008, published by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Senegal has a population of refugees and asylum seekers numbering approximately 23,800 in 2007. The majority of this population (20,200) is from Mauritania. Refugees live in N'dioum, Dodel, and small settlements along the Senegal River valley.[107]\n\nFrench is the official language, spoken by all those who have spent several years in the educational system, in which French is used as the medium of instruction (Koranic schools are also popular, but Arabic is less widely spoken outside of the context of recitation). Overall, speakers of French were estimated to make up 26% of the population in 2022.[108] During the 15th century, many European territories started to engage in trade in Senegal. In the 19th century, France increased its colonial influence in Senegal and thus the number of French-speaking people multiplied continuously. French was ratified as the official language of Senegal in 1960 when the country achieved independence.\n\nMost people also speak their own ethnic language while, especially in Dakar, Wolof is the lingua franca.[109] Pulaar is spoken by the Fulas and Toucouleur. The Serer language is widely spoken by both Serers and non-Serers (including President Sall, whose wife is Serer); so are the Cangin languages, whose speakers are ethnically Serers. Jola languages are widely spoken in the Casamance. Overall Senegal is home to around 39 distinct languages. Several have the legal status of \"national languages\": Balanta-Ganja, Arabic, Jola-Fonyi, Mandinka, Mandjak, Mankanya, Noon (Serer-Noon), Pulaar, Serer, Soninke, and Wolof.\n\nEnglish is taught as a foreign language in secondary schools and many graduate school programs, and it is the only subject matter that has a special office in the Ministry of Education.[110] Dakar hosts a couple of Bilingual schools which offer 50% of their syllabus in English. The Senegalese American Bilingual School (SABS), Yavuz Selim, and The West African College of the Atlantic (WACA) train thousands of fluent English speakers in four-year programs. English is widely used by the scientific community and in business, including by the Modou-Modou (illiterate, self-taught businessmen).[110]\n\nPortuguese Creole, locally known as Portuguese, is a prominent minority language in Ziguinchor, regional capital of the Casamance, spoken by local Portuguese creoles and immigrants from Guinea-Bissau. The local Cape Verdean community speak a similar Portuguese creole, Cape Verdean Creole, and standard Portuguese. Portuguese was introduced in Senegal's secondary education in 1961 in Dakar by the country's first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor. It is currently available in most of Senegal and in higher education. It is especially prevalent in Casamance as it relates with the local cultural identity.[111]\n\nA variety of immigrant languages are spoken, such as Bambara (70,000), Mooré (37,000), Kabuverdiano (34,000), Krio (6,100), Vietnamese (2,500), and Portuguese (1,700), mostly in Dakar.[110]\n\nWhile French is the sole official language, a rising Senegalese linguistic nationalist movement supports the integration of Wolof, the common vernacular language of the country, into the national constitution.[112]\n\nSenegalese regions of Dakar, Diourbel, Fatick, Kaffrine, Kaolack, Kedougou, Kolda, Louga, Matam, Saint-Louis, Sedhiou, Tambacounda, Thies and Ziguinchor are members of the International Association of Francophone regions.\n\nDakar, the capital, is by far the largest city in Senegal, with over two million residents.[113] The second most populous city is Touba, a de jure communaute rurale (rural community), with over half a million people.[113]\n\nSenegal is a secular state.[77] According to \"CIA World Factbook: Senegal\" Islam is the predominant religion in the country, practiced by 97.2% of the country's population; the Christian community, at 2.7% of the population, consists mostly of Roman Catholics but there are also diverse evangelicals denominations. Less than one percent has animist beliefs, particularly in the southeastern region of the country.[6] Some Serer people follow the Serer religion.[116][117] According to the Berkley Center, \"approximately 95 percent of the population is Muslim and the other five percent is primarily Christian or animist.\"[118] Marloes Janson, of SOAS, University of London, and other scholars, posit that, in Senegal, Gambia, and many African countries where Islam is dominant, Muslim communities tend to syncretise Islam with Traditional African religions, leading to a distinctive \"African Islam\".[119]\n\nAccording to a 2012 Pew demographic study, 55% of the Muslims in Senegal are Sunni of the Maliki madhhab with Sufi influences, whilst 27% are non-denominational Muslims.[120] Islamic communities in Senegal are generally organized around one of several Islamic Sufi orders called tariqas, headed by a khalif (xaliifa in Wolof, from Arabic khalīfa), who is usually a direct descendant of the group's founder; the study found that 92% of Senegalese Muslims belonged to a Sufi order. The two largest and most prominent Sufi tariqas in Senegal are the Tijaniyya, whose largest Senegalese sub-groups are based in the cities of Tivaouane and Kaolack and has broad following in West Africa outside of Senegal, and the Murīdiyya (Murid), who are based in the city of Touba and has a follower base mostly limited to within Senegal.[120]\n\nThe Halpulaar (Pulaar-speakers), composed of Fula people, a widespread group found along the Sahel from Chad to Senegal, and Toucouleurs, represent 23.8 percent of the population.[6] Historically, they were the first to become Muslim. Many of the Toucouleurs, or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal. Success was gained among the Wolofs, but repulsed by the Serers. Most communities south of the Senegal River Valley, however, were not thoroughly Islamized. The Serer people stood out as one of this group, who spent over one thousand years resisting Islamization (see Serer history). Although many Serers are Christians or Muslim, their conversion to Islam in particular is very recent and came of free will rather than by force, after forced conversion had been unsuccessfully tried centuries earlier (see Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune).[121]\n\nThe spread of formal Quranic school (called daara in Wolof) during the colonial period increased largely through the effort of the Tidjâniyya. In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term daara often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Qādiriyya order and the Senegalese Laayeen order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at daaras for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (majlis) or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, Jola, Mankanya and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves. Although Islam is Senegal's majority religion, Senegal's first president, Léopold Sédar Senghor, was a Catholic Serer.\n\nSerer religion encompasses a belief in a supreme deity called Roog (Koox among the Cangin), Serer cosmogony, cosmology and divination ceremonies such as the annual Xooy (or Khoy) ceremony presided over by the Serer Saltigues (high priests and priestesses). Senegambian (both Senegal and the Gambia) Muslim festivals such as Tobaski, Gamo, Koriteh, Weri Kor, etc., are all borrowed words from the Serer religion.[122] They were ancient Serer festivals rooted in Serer religion, not Islam.[122]\n\nThe Boukout is one of the Jola's religious ceremonies.\n\nThere are a small number of members of the Bani Israel tribe in the Senegalese bush that claim Jewish ancestry, though this is disputed.[123] The Mahayana branch of Buddhism in Senegal is followed by a very tiny portion of the expat Vietnamese community. The Bahá'í Faith in Senegal was established after 'Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, mentioned Africa as a place that should be more broadly visited by Bahá'ís.[124] The first Bahá'is to set foot in the territory of French West Africa that would become Senegal arrived in 1953.[125] The first Bahá'í Local Spiritual Assembly of Senegal was elected in 1966 in Dakar.[126] In 1975 the Bahá'í community elected the first National Spiritual Assembly of Senegal. The most recent estimate, by the Association of Religion Data Archives in a 2005 report details the population of Senegalese Bahá'ís at 22,000.[127]\n\nLife expectancy at birth was estimated to be 66.8 years in 2016 (64.7 years male, 68.7 years female).[128] Public expenditure on health was at 2.4 percent of the GDP in 2004, whereas private expenditure was at 3.5 percent.[129] Health expenditure was at US$72 (PPP) per capita in 2004.[129] The fertility rate ranged 5 to 5.3 between 2005 and 2013, with 4.1 in urban areas and 6.3 in rural areas, as official survey (6.4 in 1986 and 5.7 in 1997) point out.[130] There were six physicians per 100,000 persons in the early 2000s (decade).[129] Infant mortality in Senegal was 157 per 1,000 live births in 1950., but since then it has declined five-fold to 32 per 1,000 in 2018.[131] In the past five years infant mortality rates of malaria have dropped. According to a 2013 UNICEF report,[132] 26% of women in Senegal have undergone female genital mutilation.\n\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic began in Senegal, which led to the imposition of a curfew in the country.[133]\n\nIn July 2021, Senegal experienced a significant increase in cases of coronavirus disease.[134]\n\nIn June 2021, Senegal's Agency for Universal Health launched sunucmu.com (SunuCMU), a website that the agency hopes will streamline health care in the country. The website is a part of the Minister of State Mohammad Abdallah Dionne's plan for digitalization. He aims to make Senegal's health care system effective and sustainable. Using SunuCMU, Senegal hopes to achieve 75 percent coverage within two years of the launch.[135]\n\nArticles 21 and 22 of the Constitution adopted in January 2001 guarantee access to education for all children.[136] Education is compulsory and free up to the age of 16.[136] The Ministry of Labor has indicated that the public school system is unable to cope with the number of children that must enroll each year.[136] Portuguese is taught at schools at the secondary high school level, given the large Cape Verdean community, and also from Guinea Bissau. There are sizeable Portuguese creole and standard Portuguese speaking communities in Zinguichor and Dakar.\n\nIlliteracy is high, particularly among women.[129] The net primary enrollment rate was 69 percent in 2005. Public expenditure on education was 5.4 percent of the 2002–2005 GDP. Senegal was ranked 92nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[137]\n\nSenegal is well known for the West African tradition of storytelling, which is done by griots, who have kept West African history alive for thousands of years through words and music. The griot profession is passed down generation to generation and requires years of training and apprenticeship in genealogy, history and music. Griots give voice to generations of West African society.[35]\n\nThe African Renaissance Monument built in 2010 in Dakar is the tallest statue in Africa. Dakar also hosts a film festival, Recidak.[138]\n\nThe Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha, known locally as Tabaski, is popularly celebrated by Senegalese people. Despite being predominantly Muslim, the Christian festival of Christmas is also popularly observed, with Christmas trees and decorations lining up the city of Dakar.[22]\n\nBecause Senegal borders the Atlantic Ocean, fish is very important. Chicken, lamb, peas, eggs, and beef are also used in Senegalese cooking, but not pork, due to the nation's largely Muslim population. Peanuts, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as couscous, white rice, sweet potatoes, lentils, black-eyed peas and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.\n\nPopular fresh juices are made from bissap, ginger, buoy (pronounced 'buoy', which is the fruit of the baobab tree, also known as \"monkey bread fruit\"), mango, or other fruit or wild trees (most famously soursop, which is called corossol in French). Desserts are very rich and sweet, combining native ingredients with the extravagance and style characteristic of the French impact on Senegal's culinary methods. They are often served with fresh fruit and are traditionally followed by coffee or tea.\n\nSenegal is known across Africa for its musical roots, due to the popularity of mbalax, which originated from the Serer percussive tradition especially the Njuup, it has been popularized by Youssou N'Dour, Omar Pene and others. Sabar drumming is especially popular. The sabar is mostly used in special celebrations such as weddings. Another instrument, the tama, is used in more ethnic groups. Other popular international renowned Senegalese musicians are Ismael Lô, Cheikh Lô, Orchestra Baobab, Baaba Maal, Akon (US-born), Thione Seck, Viviane, Fallou Dieng, Titi, Seckou Keita and Pape Diouf.\n\nHospitality, in theory, is given such importance in Senegalese culture that it is widely considered to be part of the national identity. The Wolof[139] word for hospitality is \"teranga\" and it is so identified with the pride of Senegal that the national football team is known as Les Lions de la Téranga.[35][original research?]\n\nSenegalese play many sports. Wrestling and football are the most popular sports in the country. Senegal will host the 2026 Summer Youth Olympics in Dakar, making Senegal the first African country to host an Olympic event.[140][141]\n\nSenegalese wrestling is the country's most popular sport[142] and has become a national obsession.[143] It traditionally serves many young men to escape poverty and it is the only sport recognized as developed independently of Western culture.\n\nFootball is a popular sport in Senegal. In 2022 the national team beat Egypt to win the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time, and they were runners-up in 2002 and 2019. They became one of only five African teams to ever reach the quarter-finals of the FIFA World Cup, after Cameroon in 1990 and before Ghana in 2010, defeating holders France in their first game in 2002. Senegal qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia, and for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nSenegal has traditionally been one of Africa's dominant basketball powers. The men's team performed better than that of any other African nation at the 2014 FIBA World Cup, where they reached the playoffs for the first time. The women's team won 19 medals at 20 African Championships, more than twice as many medals as any competitor. When the country hosted the 2019 FIBA Women's AfroBasket, 15,000 fans flocked to the Dakar Arena which is registered as a record attendance for basketball in Africa.[144] Senegal was one of the continent's pioneers in basketball as it established one of Africa's first competitive leagues.[145]\n\nIn 2016, the NBA announced the launch of an Elite's Academy in Africa, and more precisely in Senegal.[146]\n\nThe country hosted the Paris–Dakar rally from 1979 until 2007. The Dakar Rally was an off-road endurance motorsport race which followed a course from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal. The competitors used off-road vehicles to cross the difficult geography. The last race was held in 2007, before the 2008 rally was canceled a day before the event due to security concerns in Mauritania.[147] The Ocean X-Prix of the electric off-road championship Extreme E was also hosted in Senegal.Senegal - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Senegal, cuyo nombre oficial es República del Senegal (en francés: République du Sénégal),[5]​ es un estado soberano de África Occidental cuya forma de gobierno es la república semipresidencialista. Su territorio está organizado en catorce regiones.\n\nDebe su nombre al río Senegal, que marca la frontera este y norte del país. Senegal limita con el océano Atlántico al oeste, con Mauritania al norte, con Malí al este, y con Guinea y Guinea-Bisáu al sur. Gambia forma un enclave virtual dentro de Senegal, siguiendo el río Gambia durante más de 300 km tierra adentro. Las islas de Cabo Verde se encuentran a 560 km mar adentro, frente a la costa senegalesa. La población del país se estima en aproximadamente 16 millones de personas. El clima es tropical con dos estaciones, una seca y otra lluviosa.\n\nDakar, la capital de Senegal, se ubica en el punto más occidental del país, en la península de Cabo Verde. Durante los siglos XVII y XVIII, numerosos puestos comerciales pertenecientes a diferentes potencias coloniales se establecieron en la costa. La ciudad de St. Louis se convirtió en esa época en la capital del África Occidental Francesa antes de que se mudara a Dakar en 1902. Dakar se convirtió posteriormente en su capital en 1960 en el momento de la independencia de Francia.\n\nEl país recibe su nombre del río Senegal, cuya etimología es discutida. Una teoría popular, propuesta por David Boilat en 1853, afirma que deriva de la expresión wólof sunu gaal, que significa \"nuestra canoa\", resultado de la dificultad para comunicarse entre los marineros portugueses del siglo XV y los pescadores wólof. Los historiadores modernos creen que el nombre hace referencia, probablemente, a la etnia bereber de los zenaga, quienes vivieron en la orilla norte del río. Una teoría que compite con las anteriores afirma que el nombre deriva de la ciudad medieval de \"Sanghana\" (también conocida como Isenghan, Asengan o Singhanah), descrita por el geógrafo árabe al-Bakri en 1068 como localizada en la boca del río. A pesar de todo lo anterior, la teoría de \"nuestra canoa\" ha sido popularmente abrazada en Senegal moderno por su aire caluroso y su utilidad en los llamamientos a la solidaridad nacional (por ejemplo, \"estamos todos en la misma canoa\") hace que se oiga con frecuencia en los medios de comunicación.\n\nAlgunos serer del sur creen que el nombre del río deriva, originalmente, de la unión de los términos serer \"Sene\" (de Roge Sene, deidad suprema de la religión serer) y \"O Gal\" (que significa \"cuerpo de agua\").\n\nHallazgos arqueológicos por toda el área indican que Senegal estuvo habitado en tiempos prehistóricos.\n\nLa prehistoria y la protohistoria de Senegal se asocian sobre todo a los círculos megalíticos de Senegambia o a los túmulos artificiales de conchas, como los de la isla de Fadiouth.\n\nEn la península de Cabo Verde se han descubierto bifaces con forma de almendra del Paleolítico inferior, así como otros objetos de piedra más elaborados (hachas, raspadores) en la región de Rufisque y a lo largo de los ríos del este de Senegal.\n\nEn el Neolítico, las herramientas se diversifican y aparece la cerámica. Las excavaciones en las regiones costeras han desenterrado restos de cocina que atestiguan una importante población de pescadores y comerciantes (Khant marigot en el delta, desembocadura del Saloum).\n\nLa metalurgia se desarrolló durante el periodo protohistórico (I milenio a. C.), cuando se hallaron tumbas en forma de túmulo. En el centro del país, extendiéndose hasta la actual Gambia, hay una serie de círculos de megalitos que cubren un área de 100 km por 250 km. Este tipo de alineación también se encuentra en el noreste de la República Centroafricana.\n\nLos Toucouleurs fundaron el Tekrour, el Reino de Namandirou y después el Djolof, con lejanos vínculos con el Imperio de Ghana. Entre los diversos reinos, el más poderoso en el siglo XIV era el Imperio de Djolof, que incluía Cayor, Baol, los reinos Serer de Sine y Saloum, Waalo, Fouta-Toro y Bambouk. En el sur del país se encontraba el estado de Kaabu, seguido de Fouladou.\n\nDjolof era un imperio fundado por Ndiadiane Ndiaye, el primer bourba (rey) de Djolof. Había sido elegido jefe de lo que se convertiría en el reino de Oualo, en el noroeste del actual Senegal, en la región del río. Reunió a todas las poblaciones de etnia wolof para fundar este imperio en el siglo XIII. El imperio se derrumbó en 1549 con la muerte del último emperador de Djolof, Lélé Fouli Fak, asesinado por Amary Ngoné Sobel Fall, entonces jefe de la región de Cayor.\n\nEl Islam fue introducido en Senegal entre los siglos VIII y IX por comerciantes árabes-bereberes. Difundieron la religión pacíficamente y convirtieron a los toucouleurs, que a su vez la extendieron por todo Senegal. Más tarde, en el siglo XI, los almorávides, ayudados por los toucouleurs, intentaron islamizar a los grupos religiosos tradicionales mediante la yihad. Este fue uno de los motivos de la emigración de los sereres al Sine Saloum, y de los wolof, peuls y mandingas, que se concentraron en el Tekrour.\n\nUna leyenda popular, cantada por los griots e ilustrada por el poeta-presidente Senghor, vincula el linaje del primer Bourba Djolof Ndiadiane Ndiaye a la dinastía almorávide (fundadora de Marrakech y responsable del ataque rechazado por el famoso «Cid»). El Islam se extendió muy pronto en el imperio de Djolof. Pero no fue hasta el siglo XIX cuando realmente se extendió a toda la población, de forma pacífica, gracias a los morabitos y sus cofradías, como El Hadji Malick Sy por la tijaniyya o Ahmadou Bamba, fundador de la cofradía Mouride, que asombraron a la población con su erudición y sus milagros. También fue una forma de unirse y protegerse contra los estragos de los reinos en el siglo XIX (yihads repetidas, colonización forzosa).\n\nEn el XII hasta el XIV, el área estuvo bajo la influencia de los imperios mandingas del Este; el Imperio jolof de Senegal también fue fundado durante este tiempo. En el siglo XVI, el Imperio jolof se dividió en cuatro reinos competidores: los Jolof, Waalo, Cayor y Baol.\n\nVarias potencias europeas (Portugal, los Países Bajos, e Inglaterra) compitieron por el comercio en esa área desde el siglo XV, hasta que en 1677, Francia terminó con la posesión de lo que se había convertido en un importante punto de partida del comercio de esclavos (la isla de Gorea, cercana a Dakar). Solo a partir de los años 1850, los franceses, bajo el gobernador Louis Faidherbe, comenzaron a expandirse por el propio territorio senegalés.\n\nEn enero de 1959, Senegal y el Sudán francés se unieron para formar la Federación de Malí, que se convirtió en una nación totalmente independiente el 20 de junio de 1960, como resultado de la independencia y el acuerdo de transferencia de poder firmado con Francia el 4 de abril de 1960. Debido a dificultades políticas internas, la Federación se disolvió el 20 de agosto de 1960. Senegal y Sudán (renombrado como la República de Malí) proclamaron su independencia. Léopold Senghor, un conocido poeta internacional de la negritud, político y estadista, fue elegido como primer presidente de Senegal en agosto de 1960.\n\nDespués de la disolución de la Federación de Malí, el presidente Senghor y el primer ministro Mamadou Dia gobernaron juntos bajo un sistema parlamentario. En diciembre de 1962, su rivalidad política propició un intento de golpe de Estado por parte del primer ministro. El golpe fue reducido sin derramamiento de sangre, y Dia fue arrestado y encarcelado. Senegal adoptó una nueva constitución que consolidó el poder del presidente. En 1980, el presidente Senghor se retiró de la política y transfirió el cargo a su sucesor elegido a dedo, Abdou Diouf, en 1981.\n\nSenegal se unió con Gambia para formar la Confederación de Senegambia el 1 de febrero de 1982. Sin embargo, la integración imaginada de los dos países nunca se llevó a cabo, y la unión fue disuelta en 1989. A pesar de diálogos de paz, un grupo separatista del sur, en la región de Casamanza, se ha enfrentado esporádicamente con las fuerzas gubernamentales desde 1982.[6]​ Senegal tiene una larga historia de participación en el mantenimiento de la paz internacional.\n\nAbdou Diouf fue el presidente entre 1981 y 2000. Fomentó una más que amplia participación política, redujo la intervención del gobierno en la economía, y amplió los compromisos diplomáticos de Senegal, particularmente con otras naciones en desarrollo. La política interna a veces se desbordó en violencia callejera, tensiones en las fronteras, y un movimiento separatista violento en la región del sur de Casamanza. No obstante, el compromiso de Senegal con la democracia y los derechos humanos se ha consolidado con el tiempo. Diouf sirvió cuatro mandatos como presidente. En la elección presidencial de 2000, fue derrotado en elecciones democráticas por el líder de la oposición, Abdoulaye Wade. Senegal experimentó su segunda transición pacífica al poder, y la primera de un partido político a otro.\n\nEl 30 de diciembre de 2004, el presidente Abdoulaye Wade anunció que firmaría un tratado de paz con dos facciones separatistas del Movimiento de las Fuerzas Democráticas de Casamanza (MFDC), en la región de Casamanza.\n\nSenegal es una república presidencial. Su presidente es elegido cada cinco años desde 2001, año en que Mame Madior Boye fue la primera mujer en acceder al cargo de primera ministra de Senegal, previamente siendo elegido cada siete, por voto adulto. El actual presidente es Bassirou Diomaye Faye, elegido en marzo de 2024.\n\nSenegal tiene más de 80 partidos políticos. El Parlamento bicameral está formado por la Asamblea Nacional, que cuenta con 120 asientos, y el Senado, que dispone de 100 asientos y fue reinstaurado en 2007.[7]​ En Senegal, existe también un sistema judicial independiente. Las altas instancias de justicia nacionales son el Consejo Constitucional y la Corte de Justicia, siendo sus miembros nombrados por el presidente.\n\nSenegal funciona democráticamente, siendo reconocido como uno de los países con la cultura democrática más exitosa y arraigada de África. [cita requerida] Los administradores locales son nombrados por el presidente y son responsables ante él. Los morabitos, líderes religiosos de las diferentes cofradías musulmanas de Senegal, también tienen una cierta influencia política en el país, especialmente durante la presidencia de Wade. En 2009, no obstante, Freedom House rebajó el estatus político de Senegal desde «libre» hasta «parcialmente libre», como consecuencia del aumento de la concentración del poder en el ejecutivo.\n\nEn 2008, Senegal terminó en la 12.ª posición del Ibrahim Index of African Governance.[8]​ El Ibrahim Index es un indicador comprensivo de la gobernanza en África, basado en un número de diferentes variables que reflejan el éxito con que cada gobierno provee de bienes políticos básicos a sus ciudadanos. En 2010, Senegal estaba en el puesto 15.º del índice.[8]​\n\nEn 2012, Senegal organizó elecciones presidenciales, unos comicios controvertidos como consecuencia de la candidatura de dudosa legitimidad del presidente Abdoulaye Wade. Finalmente, de las elecciones resultó victorioso Macky Sall, y Wade aceptó su derrota. Este resultado pacífico y democrático fue saludado por numerosos observadores internacionales —como la UE— como una muestra de «madurez».[9]​ En 2013, Aminata Touré fue la primera ministra de Senegal hasta 2014.\n\nSenegal ocupa un lugar destacado en muchas organizaciones internacionales y fue miembro del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en 1988-89 y 2015-2016. Fue elegido miembro de la Comisión de Derechos Humanos de la ONU en 1997. Amigable con Occidente, especialmente con Estados Unidos, Senegal ha abogado enérgicamente por una mayor ayuda de los países desarrollados al Tercer Mundo. La ministra de Asuntos Exteriores de Senegal es Aïssata Tall Sall. Tomó posesión de su cargo en noviembre de 2020.\n\nHistóricamente, Senegal ha estado cerca de Francia, su antiguo colonizador, pero esto había causado una gran tensión con algunos sectores políticos y fue una de las razones por las que el expresidente Macky Sall perdió apoyo. Los senegaleses se quejaban a menudo de que Sall otorgaba sistemáticamente a las empresas francesas contratos prioritarios para extraer los recursos naturales de Senegal, en lugar de dar los contratos a quien ofreciera a Senegal el mejor trato. También creían que Francia estaba presionando a Macky Sall para que se presentara a un tercer mandato inconstitucional. Tras debatir durante meses si presentarse por tercera vez, Sall no lo hizo.[10]​\n\nSenegal mantiene relaciones cordiales con sus vecinos. A pesar de los claros avances en otras cuestiones con Mauritania (seguridad fronteriza, gestión de recursos, integración económica, etc.), se calcula que unos 35.000 refugiados mauritanos (de los aproximadamente 40.000 que fueron expulsados de su país de origen en 1989) permanecen en Senegal.[11]​\n\nSenegal está bien integrado en los principales organismos de la comunidad internacional, como la Comunidad Económica de los Estados de África Occidental (CEDEAO), la Unión Africana (UA) y la Comunidad de Estados Sahelosaharianos.\n\nSenegal está considerada en la escena internacional como una de las democracias más estables de África[12]​ como resultado de tres transiciones de poder pacíficas desde 1960 (Banco Mundial). La política senegalesa se basa principalmente en sus vecinos inmediatos, el resto de África, el mundo árabe y otros estados musulmanes, y las democracias occidentales y gira en torno a Mauritania, Malí, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau y Gambia . Una fuente de conflicto entre Senegal y las naciones de su entorno ha sido la gestión y el desarrollo de los recursos fronterizos compartidos.[13]​\n\nLa política exterior senegalesa también gira en torno a la implicación de Senegal en los asuntos internos de otras naciones africanas y el deseo de asumir y establecer un papel de liderazgo en una miríada de organizaciones comprometidas con la promoción de la integración regional y la unidad africana. Los compromisos internacionales son un aspecto distintivo de la política exterior senegalesa e incluyen acuerdos con organizaciones internacionales que operan en Senegal y con miembros de organizaciones estatales a las que pertenece Senegal.[14]​ Una resolución obligatoria por mandato de las Naciones Unidas o un decreto de la Comunidad Económica de Estados de África Occidental (CEDEAO) pueden constituir un compromiso internacional de Senegal.\n\nEn la actualidad, la política exterior senegalesa se caracteriza por un nacionalismo alimentado por el lugar que Senegal ocupó en su día dentro de la colonia francesa y por una cultura tradicional. De este modo, constituye un sentimiento de superioridad regional en lo que respecta al ámbito de la integración regional. Los treinta y cinco años de gobierno democrático ininterrumpido en Senegal también han sido un factor clave en la política exterior senegalesa.Más del setenta por ciento de la población depende de la agricultura para su estabilidad económica y la mayor parte de los ingresos económicos de Senegal proceden de la exportación de cacahuetes.[15]​\n\nPor ello, Senegal trabaja actualmente en la transformación estructural de su economía mediante la aplicación de una forma de diplomacia económica para reforzar la estabilidad regional y conquistar mercados extranjeros.[16]​ Senegal desempeña un papel activo en organizaciones internacionales como el Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, la Comunidad Económica de los Estados de África Occidental (CEDEAO), la Nepad y la Organización de Cooperación Islámica o la Organización Internacional de la Francofonía (WorldBank).[17]​\n\nLas Fuerzas Armadas de Senegal (en francés: Forces armées du Sénégal) cuentan con unos 17.000 efectivos en el ejército, la fuerza aérea, la marina y la gendarmería. Las fuerzas militares de Senegal reciben la mayor parte de su entrenamiento, equipamiento y apoyo de Francia y Estados Unidos. Alemania también presta apoyo, pero a menor escala.\n\nLa no injerencia militar en los asuntos políticos ha contribuido a la estabilidad de Senegal desde su independencia. Senegal ha participado en numerosas misiones internacionales y regionales de mantenimiento de la paz. En 2000, Senegal envió un batallón a la República Democrática del Congo para participar en la MONUC, la misión de mantenimiento de la paz de las Naciones Unidas.\n\nSenegal también aceptó desplegar un batallón entrenado por Estados Unidos en Sierra Leona para participar en UNAMSIL, otra misión de mantenimiento de la paz de la ONU. La operación de adiestramiento se denominó Operación Focus Relief y en ella participaron Fuerzas Especiales del Ejército de Estados Unidos pertenecientes al 3.er Grupo de Fuerzas Especiales que adiestraron a varios batallones de África Occidental, entre ellos algunos nigerianos.\n\nComo uno de los mayores contribuyentes de tropas de África (per cápita) a las misiones de la Unión Africana, de las Naciones Unidas y de otras organizaciones regionales de seguridad, el ejército senegalés ha demostrado ser uno de los más eficaces y fiables del continente africano. Esto es notable teniendo en cuenta que Senegal es más pobre que la media de los países del África subsahariana. Y lo que es más importante, el ejército de Senegal es multiétnico, no es golpista y nunca ha intentado dar un golpe de Estado, lo cual es una rareza en África. Las armoniosas relaciones cívico-militares senegalesas desde la independencia han permitido la creación de un «enclave militar» eficaz que es una institución capaz y no una amenaza para los dirigentes políticos de Dakar.[18]​\n\nDesde su independencia de Francia en 1960, el ejército ha sufrido numerosas reorganizaciones. El patrimonio del ejército incluye los Tirailleurs sénégalais. En 1978, Senegal envió un batallón a la Fuerza Interafricana en Zaire, tras los combates de Shaba II. El contingente senegalés estaba bajo el mando del coronel Osmane Ndoye.[19]​ La fuerza senegalesa incluía un batallón de paracaidistas de Thiaroye.\n\nEl Ejército consta actualmente de dos divisiones, la División de Operaciones y la División Logística. El IISS estimó en 2012 que el Ejército contaba con una fuerza de 11.900 soldados, tres batallones blindados el 22.º, 24.º y 25.º (en Bignona) y el 26.º Bataillon de reconnaissance et d'Appui en Kolda; hay seis batallones de infantería numerados del 1.º al 6.º[20]​ El 3.º Batallón puede haber estado en Kaolack con el 4.º en Tambacounda en un momento dado.[21]​\n\nLa armada (marina), también conocida como Armée de mer, es de pequeño tamaño y está comandada por un capitán de navío. Se encarga de proteger las 286 millas náuticas (530 kilómetros) de costa atlántica de Senegal, estratégicamente situada en el extremo occidental del continente africano. La costa está dividida en dos por Gambia. La marina fue creada en 1975[22]​ y tiene dos bases, una en Dakar y otra en Elinkine. La marina también patrulla las aguas territoriales de 12 millas náuticas (22 kilómetros), así como una zona económica exclusiva declarada de 200 millas náuticas (370 kilómetros).[23]​\n\nLa Fuerza Aérea (Armée de l'Air) está orientada a proporcionar apoyo a las fuerzas terrestres y se asemeja a un cuerpo de aviación del ejército. Posee helicópteros de combate Mil Mi-24, así como aviones de transporte y reconocimiento.\n\nEn materia de derechos humanos, respecto a la pertenencia a los siete organismos de la Carta Internacional de Derechos Humanos, que incluyen al Comité de Derechos Humanos (HRC), Senegal ha firmado o ratificado:\n\nSenegal se subdivide en 14 regiones,[34]​ cada una de ellas administrada por un Conseil Régional (Consejo Regional) elegido según el peso de la población al nivel de cada Arrondissement. El país está además subdividido en 45 Départements, 103 Arrondissements (ninguno de los cuales dispone de funciones administrativas) y por Collectivités Locales, cada una de las cuales elige oficiales administrativos.[35]​\n\nLas capitales regionales tienen el mismo nombre que sus regiones:\n\nSenegal está situado en la parte Oeste del continente africano, entre 12°8′ y 16°41′ de latitud norte, y 11°21′ y 17°32′ de longitud Oeste. Su punto oeste, el Cabo Verde (y particularmente el emplazamiento del Club Med de Dakar), constituye la parte más occidental del continente africano.\n\nEl paisaje senegalés consiste principalmente en planos ondulados por la arena del oeste de Sahel que crecen hasta faldas de montaña en el sudeste. Allí se encuentra también el punto más alto de Senegal, un accidente geográfico sin nombre cerca de Nepen Diakha, con 581 m de altura. El límite norteño está formado por el río Senegal. Otros ríos destacables son el río Gambia y el río Casamanza. La capital Dakar yace sobre la península Cabo Verde, el punto más occidental del África continental.\n\nEl país se extiende sobre 196 722 km².[1]​ Comparado con los países vecinos (Malí y Mauritania), Senegal es un país más pequeño.\n\nEl clima es desértico en el norte y de sabana tropical en el sur, con :\n\nPosee una estación lluviosa de junio a octubre, con un pico en agosto; septiembre varía según la latitud (llueve menos en el norte que en el sur). Es la estación de los monzones. Sólo en Casamance, la única región con bosques dignos de este nombre, hay una verdadera estación lluviosa;\n\nuna estación seca de noviembre a junio con vientos alisios continentales, con temperaturas entre 22 y 30 °C, con variaciones significativas entre la costa y el interior.[36]​[37]​\n\nLas temperaturas varían[38]​ con las estaciones:\n\nEn verano, la estación de las lluvias, a menudo denominada erróneamente «invernada» desde la época colonial, las temperaturas son máximas ;Sin embargo, son más bajas en enero-febrero, periodo también abusivamente denominado «invernal». Por otra parte, las precipitaciones son más marcadas de sur a norte.\n\nEn la costa, el mar (con la corriente fría de Canarias) aporta frescor, con temperaturas del orden de 16 a 30 °C, pero el centro y el este de Senegal pueden registrar temperaturas de hasta 46 °C. Durante el invierno en Europa, Senegal se convierte en un destino popular para desarrollar el turismo.\n\nEn general, el oeste del país, a lo largo de la costa, tiene temperaturas más frescas que el este, gracias al océano. El centro y el este del país experimentan temperaturas continentales, muy calurosas durante el día y frescas por la noche.\n\nDe norte a sur, hay cinco tipos de zonas climáticas pertenecientes al clima tropical:\n• en la zona saheliana, al norte, en la región de Saint-Louis, la vegetación típica del Sahel representa el dominio arbóreo o estepario arbustivo. La desertización afecta actualmente a esta zona. La acacia de Senegal es el árbol más común, junto con algunos baobabs;\n• En la zona sahelo-sudanesa, que abarca las regiones de Dakar, Thiès, Diourbel, Louga y Matam, la estepa ha dado paso a la sabana seca arbolada. El baobab, la acacia y el árbol del queso son los árboles dominantes;\n• en la zona sudanesa, hacia las regiones de Fatick, Kaolack y todo el norte y centro de la región de Tambacounda, la vegetación de tipo sabana es mucho más densa que en la zona anterior: los árboles están mucho más presentes y aparecen bosques dispersos. Los baobabs, las acacias, los quesos y las palmeras son los árboles dominantes en esta zona;\n• en la zona sudano-guineana, al norte de las regiones de Ziguinchor y Kolda, y al sur de la región de Tambacounda, los bosques están muy presentes, así como grandes sabanas muy densas. Los árboles son variados: baobabs, quesos, palmeras, filaos y ruanos;\n• la zona guineana, a caballo entre el sur de las regiones de Ziguinchor y Kolda. Es la zona más húmeda, con bosques densos. Aquí se encuentran todos los árboles de Senegal..\n\nSegún WWF, el territorio de Senegal se reparte entre cuatro ecorregiones:\n• Sabana de acacias del Sahel, en el norte.\n• Sabana sudanesa occidental, en el centro y sureste.\n• Mosaico de selva y sabana de Guinea, en el oeste y sur.\n• None Manglares en el Delta de Saloum Manglar guineano, en algunos puntos de la costa meridional.\n\nLos parques y reservas naturales representan el 8 % del territorio nacional. Tienen un papel importante en la preservación del medio ambiente y contribuyen de manera significativa al desarrollo turístico. En estos espacios protegidos se ha identificado un total de 169 especies de mamíferos, y 540 especies de aves.\n\nSenegal cuenta con seis parques nacionales: el parque nacional de Niokolo-Koba, al este del país; el parque nacional de las aves de Djoudj; el parque nacional de la Lengua de Berbería, en la región de Saint-Louis; el parque nacional de las Islas de la Magdalena a lo largo de Dakar; el parque nacional del Delta del Salum en el sur, y el parque nacional de la Baja Casamance, cerrado desde hace unos años debido a disturbios en la región.\n\nEl país incluye también una treintena de reservas naturales de menor tamaño, como la Reserva de Guembeul, la Reserva de Bandia, la Reserva Natural de Popenguine, o el espacio marino protegido de Bamboung.\n\nLa cuenca sedimentaria senegalesa es un segmento de la cuenca senegalo-mauritano-guineana, una vasta cuenca costera situada en el margen continental pasivo. Esta cuenca sedimentaria limita al este y al sureste con la cadena mauritana y al sur con la cuenca de Bové. En su máxima extensión (Mauritania-Guinea-Bissau), la cuenca tiene 1.300 km de longitud, con una anchura máxima de unos 550 km en la latitud de Dakar.\n\nApoyada en el cratón de África Occidental, la cuenca costera acumula una potente serie sedimentaria, principalmente de origen marino, que comienza en el periodo Triásico-Liásico y termina en el Mioceno. Desde el borde oriental de la cuenca, cerca de Bakel, los depósitos se engrosan hacia el oeste, al principio de forma gradual, luego, al pasar una flexión situada entre los 15°30′ O y los 16°30′O9,[39]​[40]​ su espesor aumenta rápidamente, alcanzando, en Dakar, espesores de más de 6.000 m a 7.000 m.[41]​ En Casamance, las profundidades estimadas superan los ocho mil metros.\n\nA pesar del carácter aparentemente subhorizontal de los estratos, los datos de las prospecciones petrolíferas indican que los yacimientos están muy estructurados y compartimentados, como ilustra el horst de Diass. En Senegal, la serie Mesozoica-Cenozoica aflorante se limita a los niveles estratigráficos superiores, interceptando muy marginalmente rocas de edad Campaniense, mientras que el Maastrichtiense está mejor expuesto en el horst de Diass, a pesar de la presencia de una potente coraza laterítica.\n\nLas series cenozoicas están más ampliamente representadas en afloramiento, expuestas en los acantilados de la península de Cabo Verde y también en los acantilados al oeste y al sur de Thiès, y marginalmente en el Sine Saloum, donde se conocen principalmente por los pozos. Los mejores afloramientos se encuentran en el margen atlántico pasivo. En el corazón de la cuenca, la serie sedimentaria está enmascarada por una armadura laterítica del Terciario tardío y, hacia el noroeste, por depósitos de sedimentos eólicos cuaternarios. En esta región central y oriental, los únicos afloramientos terciarios conocidos se limitan a las orillas del lago de Guiers y al valle superior del río Senegal, en la región de Matam, donde las areniscas de la «Continental Terminal» (rebautizada Formación Saloum en 2009) sellan y enmascaran en gran medida la serie paleógena marina. En Casamance, los sondeos muestran que la serie marina se extiende hasta el Mioceno.\n\nEl volcanismo mioceno aparece disperso regionalmente en la península de Cabo Verde y en la región de Thiès; está representado por lavas y tobas coronadas por una armadura laterítica ferruginosa de edad pliocena tardía.[42]​ El vulcanismo cuaternario, polifásico, se limita al extremo de la península de Cabo Verde.\n\nLos mapas geológicos recientes de Senegal (2009) se han elaborado en el marco de la cooperación Senegal-Unión Europea, siguiendo los procedimientos del noveno Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo (FED) por cuenta de la Dirección de Minas y Geología (DMG), y existen a escala 1:500.000 para las tres cuartas partes del territorio y 1:200.000 a lo largo del río Senegal.\n\nSenegal cuenta con una red hidrográfica bastante limitada. Los ríos más importantes, con la excepción de la región de Casamance, nacen en Guinea (Fouta-Djalon). El río Senegal tiene una longitud de 1.750 km. Nace en la República de Guinea a 750 m de altitud y forma la frontera entre Malí y Mauritania antes de desembocar en el océano Atlántico en Saint-Louis.\n\nEl río Senegal se forma en Bafoulabé (Malí) por la confluencia de dos ríos: el Bafing y el Bakoye. Recibe en su orilla izquierda el Faleme, que es su principal afluente, y en la derecha el Kolinbiné, el Karakoro y el Gorgol. Su caudal es irregular y depende totalmente de las lluvias monzónicas (100 a 1000 m³/s). Senegal posee numerosos lagos de agua dulce y salada, siendo los principales el Lago Rosa y el Lago de Guiers. Este último se alimenta del río Senegal y del agua de lluvia del Ferlo. Es el único embalse de agua dulce de la región y abastece a la capital del 30% del agua consumida en la zona de Dakar.\n\nSenegal es un país sudanosaheliano con pocos ríos y déficit pluviométrico regular. Para poner fin a esta situación, se ha desarrollado un programa hidráulico.\n\nSegún Aquastat,[43]​ la precipitación media anual es de 686 mm, es decir, para una superficie de 196.720 kilómetros cuadrados, un volumen pluviométrico anual de 134,95 km³ (en la Francia metropolitana a modo de comparación es de 477,99 km³).\n\nDe estas precipitaciones, la evapotranspiración y la infiltración consumen unos 111,15 km³. Esto deja 23,8 km³ de recursos hídricos superficiales de producción nacional. Además, cada año se produce una cantidad renovable de 2 km³ de aguas subterráneas, también a nivel interno.\n\nA estos recursos de 25,8 km³ producidos internamente, hay que añadir 13 kilómetros cúbicos de agua producida en el extranjero, que forman parte de los recursos utilizables del país una vez cruzada la frontera. Se trata de los flujos procedentes de Guinea a través del río Gambia y sus afluentes (es decir, 2 km³), y de la mitad del volumen de agua transportada por el río Senegal desde Malí (la otra mitad se reserva a Mauritania, ya que este río constituye la frontera entre los dos países, una vez que Malí ha abandonado el país), es decir, 22 km³ divididos por 2, es decir, unos 11 km³.\n\nTeniendo en cuenta estas aportaciones, los recursos hídricos totales anuales del país ascienden a unos 38,8 kilómetros cúbicos (38.800 millones de m³), es decir, para una población estimada en 12 millones de habitantes en 2008, unos 3.200 m³ de agua por habitante, lo que resulta satisfactorio en comparación con muchos países en riesgo de sequía en África e incluso en otros lugares. A título comparativo, Sudáfrica, el país más industrializado del África subsahariana, dispone de algo más de 1.000 m³ de agua por habitante y año, Alemania de algo más de 1.850 m³ y Francia de más o menos 3.300 m³ por año.\n\nHay que añadir que una cierta cantidad de agua sale del territorio cada año: 5 km³ hacia la República de Gambia (río Gambia y sus afluentes) y 0,4 hacia Guinea-Bissau (río Geba), lo que hace un total de 5,4 kilómetros cúbicos.\n\nDespués de que su economía se contrajera un 2,1 % en 1993, Senegal puso en marcha un importante programa de reformas económicas con el apoyo de la comunidad internacional de donantes. Este paquete de reformas comenzó con una devaluación de la moneda del país, el Franco CFA, del 50 %. Se desmantelaron asimismo los controles de precios y los subsidios del Gobierno. Como resultado de lo anterior, la inflación senegalesa se contuvo y disminuyó, aumentó la inversión y el PIB creció alrededor de un 5 % al año entre 1995 y 2001.[7]​\n\nLos principales sectores económicos en Senegal son el procesamiento de alimentos, la minería, el cemento, los fertilizantes artificiales, la industria química, la refinería de productos petrolíferos importados y el turismo. Las principales exportaciones del país son la pesca, los químicos, el algodón, la tela, los cacahuetes y el fosfato de calcio, y los principales mercados exteriores son Francia, Estados Unidos, China, Italia, India y Reino Unido.[44]​\n\nComo miembro de la Unión Económica y Monetaria de África Occidental (UEMOA), Senegal está dando pasos hacia una mayor integración regional y unos aranceles externos unificados. Senegal también forma parte de la Organización para la Armonización del Derecho Mercantil en África.[45]​\n\nSegún el Índice mundial de innovación, a cargo de la Organización Mundial de la Propiedad Intelectual, en 2024, Senegal se ubicó en lugar 92 en innovación entre 133 países del mundo;[46]​ mientras que en 2023 ocupó el lugar 93 y el lugar 99 en 2022.[47]​[48]​\n\nCon la introducción del primer resort Club Med en la década de 1970, comenzó el crecimiento del turismo, el cual hoy es una parte importante de la economía del país. Desde la década de 1990, Senegal ha hecho un esfuerzo para captar turistas de Francia, ya que Senegal fue previamente uno de sus dominios. También está atrayendo turistas de España, Reino Unido e Italia, en parte motivado por el ejemplo de su vecina Gambia, la cual tiene un mayor porcentaje de turistas de Europa del Norte y de América gracias a los resorts costeros de Banjul.[49]​\n\nEn 2008, Senegal alcanzó un millón de turistas extranjeros. Su tasa de retorno se quedó en aproximadamente un 30 % (2008).[49]​\n\nLa agricultura es uno de los sectores dominantes de la economía senegalesa, a pesar de que Senegal se encuentra en la región del Sahel, propensa a la sequía. Como sólo un 5% de la tierra es de regadío, Senegal sigue dependiendo de la agricultura de secano. La agricultura ocupa alrededor del 75% de la mano de obra. A pesar de una producción agrícola relativamente variada, la mayoría de los agricultores producen para satisfacer sus necesidades de subsistencia. El mijo, el arroz, el maíz y el sorgo son los principales cultivos alimentarios de Senegal. La producción está sujeta a la sequía y a las amenazas de plagas como la langosta, los pájaros, la mosca de la fruta y la mosca blanca. Además, se prevé que los efectos del cambio climático en Senegal perjudiquen gravemente a la economía agrícola debido a fenómenos meteorológicos extremos como la sequía, así como al aumento de las temperaturas.[50]​\n\nSenegal es un importador neto de alimentos, sobre todo de arroz, que representa casi el 75% de las importaciones de cereales. Los cacahuetes, la caña de azúcar y el algodón son cultivos comerciales importantes, y se cultiva una gran variedad de frutas y verduras para los mercados locales y de exportación. En 2006, las exportaciones de goma arábiga se dispararon hasta los 280 millones de dólares, lo que la convierte, con diferencia, en la principal exportación agrícola. Las judías verdes, el tomate industrial, el tomate cherry, el melón y el mango son los principales cultivos comerciales hortícolas de Senegal. La región de Casamance, aislada del resto de Senegal por Gambia, es una importante zona productora de productos agrícolas, pero carece de infraestructuras y enlaces de transporte que mejoren su capacidad.[51]​\n\nA pesar de la falta de modernización de la pesca artesanal, el sector pesquero sigue siendo el principal recurso económico de Senegal y la principal fuente de divisas. Los sectores ganadero y avícola están relativamente poco desarrollados y tienen potencial de modernización, desarrollo y crecimiento. Senegal importa la mayor parte de su leche y productos lácteos. El sector está inhibido debido a la escasa producción y a las limitadas inversiones. La producción potencial de fauna y productos forestales es elevada y diversificada y podría, si se organiza bien, beneficiar a los agricultores pobres de las zonas rurales. Aunque el sector agrícola se vio afectado por una invasión de langostas en 2004, se ha recuperado y se espera que la producción agrícola bruta aumente un 6,1% en 2006 y un 5,1% en 2007.\n\nLa red de carreteras es buena en el oeste, pero se deteriora a medida que el país se adentra en el interior. La red de transporte está bien desarrollada en las grandes ciudades, con taxis, autobuses25 y/o «autobuses rápidos» en diversos grados de reparación. En los suburbios y ciudades secundarias se utilizan taxis colectivos, «autobuses rápidos» y vehículos de caballos. En el interior, se utilizan taxis colectivos para desplazarse entre pequeñas ciudades y pueblos. El transporte interurbano se realiza en berlinas de siete plazas, autobuses interurbanos y autocares blancos llamados Ndiaga Ndiaye, que pueden recogerse de camino a las estaciones de autobuses.\n• Transafricaine 1 (en), El Cairo - Dakar\n\nLas redes son más densas en el oeste del país, a lo largo de la costa, pero la circulación de mercancías y personas es especialmente difícil hacia Dakar y la península de Cabo Verde. Las infraestructuras son más escasas en el este de Senegal, y la apertura de estas regiones es también un reto, ya que los medios de transporte siguen siendo a menudo tradicionales en el interior.\n\nSe están haciendo grandes esfuerzos en materia de equipamiento. Hay varios proyectos en marcha, entre ellos un tramo de autopista de M'Bour a Kaolack, en construcción desde noviembre de 2021 (inauguración prevista en 2024 / 2025). Con el tiempo, se construirá una red de autopistas de varios cientos de kilómetros. Un tramo de autopista que discurre hacia el norte desde el nuevo aeropuerto internacional de Dakar está abierto al tráfico desde el 18 de diciembre de 2018 hasta Touba, conocido como ilaa Touba.\n\nLa construcción de una autopista de peaje entre Dakar y Diamniadio (35 km), finalizada el 10 de agosto de 2013, también unirá Dakar con Rufisque en menos de veinte minutos. A medio plazo, creará nuevas zonas residenciales gracias a sus numerosas rampas de salida, con el fin de descongestionar el tráfico en Dakar.\n\nTambién se han completado otros dos tramos de autopista, de Diamniadio al aeropuerto internacional Blaise-Diagne (inaugurado el 7 de diciembre de 2017) y de este último aeropuerto a M'Bour, en el sur del país. Hay otros proyectos en estudio o en curso, como la transformación de Saint-Louis en puerto marítimo de cabotaje[52]​ y el desarrollo del puerto de Ziguinchor para la manipulación de contenedores.[53]​\n\nEl aeropuerto internacional Léopold-Sédar-Senghor fue la principal puerta de entrada aérea a Senegal hasta que fue sustituido por el aeropuerto Blaise Diagne el 8 de diciembre de 2017. El 25 de mayo de 1971, el avión supersónico Concorde realizó su primer vuelo de demostración París-Dakar en 2 horas y 52 minutos (incluyendo 2 horas y 7 minutos en vuelo supersónico) y el 21 de enero de 1976 abrió por primera vez la ruta comercial París-Dakar-Río.\n\nEl Presidente Senghor asistió a su llegada al aeropuerto de Dakar, junto con los primeros pasajeros supersónicos de la historia de la aviación. La ruta París-Río finalizó el 1 de abril de 1982.\n\nCreada en 2000, la compañía Air Sénégal International, filial del grupo Royal Air Maroc, vuela a destinos en Europa y África desde el 23 de febrero de 2001. Miembro de la IATA desde el 28 de mayo de 2002,[54]​ fue nombrada mejor compañía aérea africana en 2003. Sin embargo, a raíz de dificultades financieras y disputas entre sus principales accionistas, Royal Air Maroc y el gobierno senegalés, cesó todos sus vuelos el 24 de abril de 2009.[55]​\n\nEn octubre de 2009 se creó una nueva compañía, Senegal Airlines, de la que el Estado senegalés es accionista minoritario. Desde principios de 2010, esta nueva aerolínea vuela a una veintena de destinos africanos desde Dakar. En el Salón Aeronáutico de Dubái, en noviembre de 2009, Senegal Airlines anunció que había encargado dos Airbus A330 y cuatro Airbus A320. Pero en 2016, el gobierno retiró la concesión comercial a la aerolínea debido al déficit presupuestario de la compañía.\n\nEn 2016, se creó Air Sénégal como sustituta.[56]​\n\nLa estación de ferrocarril de Dakar es la más antigua de Senegal. Tras una importante renovación, esta estación se utiliza para la nueva línea TER, que se inauguró y abrió el 27 de diciembre de 2021. Los servicios comerciales de pasajeros comenzaron entonces el 28 de diciembre de 2021, con un periodo de viaje gratuito que duró hasta el 17 de enero de 2022. Cabe señalar que las 2 vías del TER cumplen las normas internacionales (electrificación de 25KV, ancho de vía de 1.435 mm, trenes TER de última generación).\n\nEn 2024 / 2025, el TER enlazará con el nuevo aeropuerto internacional de Dakar, cuya terminal actual (2022) se encuentra en Diamniadio. El enlace con Bamako (en Mali) ya no está activo actualmente, pero se ha renovado una vía de metro reservada al transporte de mercancías desde la estación de Dakar hasta el puerto, que podría ampliarse hacia el este en el futuro si fuera necesario.\n\nEl transporte marítimo consiste en botes de remos a la isla de Gorée desde Dakar, el enlace marítimo Dakar-Ziguinchor proporcionado por el Consortium sénégalais d'activités maritimes, y barcos para cruceros por el río Senegal (como el Bou El Mogdad). También hay grandes cargueros que se benefician de la Autoridad Portuaria de Dakar, uno de los tres puertos de gran calado de África Occidental, y de su terminal de contenedores.\n\nSenegal tiene una población de unos 16,9 millones de habitantes, de los cuales aproximadamente el 42 % vive en zonas rurales. La densidad en estas zonas varía de una alta densidad de hab/km² en la región centrooccidental a menos de 10 por kilómetro cuadrado en la árida sección oriental.[57]​\n\nSenegal cuenta con una gran variedad de grupos étnicos y, como en la mayoría de los países de África Occidental, se hablan varias lenguas. Los wólof son el grupo étnico más numeroso de Senegal, con un 43 %; los fula y los toucouleur (también conocidos como halpulaar'en, literalmente «hablantes de pulaar») (24 %) son el segundo grupo más numeroso, seguidos de los serer (14,7 %), y luego otros como los jola (4 %), los mandinga (3 %), los moros o (naarkajors), los soninké, los basari y muchas comunidades más pequeñas (9 %).[cita requerida]\n\nUnos 50 000 europeos (en su mayoría franceses) residen en Senegal. Un número menor de otros emigrantes, en concreto mauritanos libaneses y marroquíes, residen en Senegal, principalmente en las ciudades y algunos jubilados que residen en las ciudades turísticas de los alrededores de Mbour. La mayoría de los libaneses trabajan en el comercio.[58]​ La mayoría de los libaneses son originarios de la ciudad libanesa de Tiro, conocida como la «pequeña áfrica occidental» y cuyo paseo principal se llama «avenue du Senegal».[59]​\n\nEl país experimentó una oleada de inmigración procedente de Francia en las décadas comprendidas entre la Segunda Guerra Mundial y la independencia senegalesa; la mayoría de estos franceses adquirieron viviendas en Dakar u otros grandes centros urbanos.[60]​ También hay pequeñas comunidades vietnamitas y un número creciente de inmigrantes chinos, cada una de ellas con unos pocos cientos de personas.[61]​[62]​ También hay decenas de miles de refugiados mauritanos en Senegal, principalmente en el norte del país.[63]​\n\nSegún la Encuesta Mundial sobre Refugiados 2008, publicada por el Comité de EE. UU. para los Refugiados y los Inmigrantes, Senegal tenía una población de refugiados y solicitantes de asilo de aproximadamente 23 800 personas en 2007. La mayoría de esta población (20 200) procede de Mauritania. Los refugiados viven en N'dioum, Dodel y pequeños asentamientos a lo largo del valle del río Senegal.[64]​\n\nEl francés es la lengua oficial, hablada al menos por todos los que pasaron varios años en el sistema educativo de origen francés (las escuelas coránicas son aún más populares, pero el árabe se habla menos fuera del contexto de la recitación). Sin embargo, en total, el francés sólo lo entienden alrededor del 15-20 % de los varones y el 1-2 % de las mujeres.[65]​ Durante el siglo XV, muchos territorios europeos empezaron a comerciar con Senegal. En el siglo Xix, Francia aumentó su influencia colonial en Senegal, por lo que el número de francófonos se multiplicó continuamente. El francés fue ratificado como lengua oficial de Senegal en 1960, cuando el país alcanzó la independencia.\n\nLa mayoría de la población también habla su propia lengua étnica, mientras que, sobre todo en Dakar, el wolof es la lengua franca. El fula lo hablan los fulas y los toucouleurs. En total, Senegal alberga unas 39 lenguas distintas. Varias tienen el estatus legal de «lenguas nacionales»: balanta-ganja, árabe, jola-fonyi, mandenká, mandjak, mankanya, noon (Serer-Noon), pulaar, serer, soninké y wolof.\n\nEl inglés se enseña como lengua extranjera en la enseñanza secundaria y en muchos programas de postgrado, y es la única materia que cuenta con una oficina especial en el Ministerio de Educación.[66]​ Dakar alberga un par de colegios bilingües que ofrecen el 50 % de su plan de estudios en inglés. El Senegalese American Bilingual School (SABS), el Yavuz Selim y el West African College of the Atlantic (WACA) forman a miles de personas que dominan el inglés en programas de cuatro años. El inglés se utiliza mucho en la comunidad científica y en los negocios, incluidos los modou-modou (empresarios analfabetos y autodidactas).[66]​\n\nSenegal es un estado laico,[67]​ aunque el islam es la religión predominante en el país, practicada por el 96,6 % de la población; la comunidad cristiana, con el 3,3 % de la población, es mayoritariamente católica, pero también hay diversas confesiones protestantes. Menos del 1 % tiene creencias animistas, sobre todo en la región sureste del país.[68]​\n\nSegún un estudio demográfico de Pew de 2012, el 55 % de los musulmanes de Senegal son suníes de la madhhab maliki con influencias sufíes, mientras que el 27 % son musulmanes aconfesionales.[69]​ Las comunidades islámicas de Senegal suelen organizarse en torno a una de las diversas órdenes sufíes islámicas denominadas tariqas, encabezadas por un khalif, que suele ser descendiente directo del fundador del grupo; según el estudio, el 92 % de los musulmanes senegaleses pertenecían a una orden sufí. Las dos tariqas sufíes más grandes y destacadas de Senegal son la Tijaniyyah, cuyos subgrupos senegaleses más numerosos tienen su sede en las ciudades de Tivaouane y Kaolack y cuenta con amplios seguidores en África Occidental fuera de Senegal, y la Murīdiyya, que tiene su sede en la ciudad de Touba y cuenta con una base de seguidores limitada principalmente al interior de Senegal.[69]​\n\nLa capital de Senegal es Dakar, de lejos la mayor ciudad del país con más de dos millones de residentes.[70]​ La segunda ciudad más poblada es Touba, una communauté rurale (comuna rural) de iure, con más de medio millón.[70]​[71]​\n\nAunque Senegal también acoge a un gran número de migrantes, tanto estacionales como de otro tipo, procedentes de países vecinos y lejanos,[73]​ también hay una gran comunidad senegalesa que vive fuera del país.\n\nEn 2018, más de 530.000 senegaleses vivían fuera del país.[74]​ Esta diáspora representa un recurso esencial para el país, tanto desde el punto de vista económico como identitario. A principios de la década de 2000, las transferencias financieras representaban entre el 5 y el 10% del PIB, es decir, entre 300 y 500 millones de euros al año.[75]​ En 2017, estos senegaleses en el extranjero inyectaron más de 2.050 millones de euros (1.169 billones de francos CFA, o el 12,5% del PIB de Senegal) en el país cada año, según cifras extraídas de la Política Nacional de Migración de Senegal (PMNS).\n\nLas tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC) contribuyen a mantener los lazos familiares y las redes tradicionales.\n\nSon principalmente hombres jóvenes los que se instalan en Europa, sobre todo en Francia, o en Norteamérica, especialmente en Quebec (Canadá), con planes de regresar a su país al cabo de unos años.\n\nEn 2017, el 75% de los jóvenes senegaleses (principalmente del sur, sureste y norte del país) deseaban abandonar el país.[76]​ El aumento de la inmigración ilegal en las peores condiciones, en particular hacia las Islas Canarias, (España) es una gran preocupación para Senegal y los países de acogida. Los más desesperados quieren ignorar los riesgos, sensibles al éxito de unos pocos y, en particular, de personalidades de la diáspora - nacidas en Senegal o de padres senegaleses - sobre todo en los medios artísticos o deportivos.\n\nInicialmente país de emigración rural soninké y fulani del valle del río Senegal hacia Francia a partir de la época colonial [77]​, y luego hacia los países de la subregión, Senegal ha conocido una emigración más diversificada, originada tanto en el centro-oeste del país como en las grandes ciudades, que han actuado como lugares de paso y tránsito hacia la escena internacional desde la independencia.[78]​\n\nLa inestabilidad política y económica de los países vecinos y el cierre de las fronteras europeas han tenido como efecto la transformación del sistema de migración rotatoria (o noria) en un asentamiento más permanente. El control cada vez más estricto de las fronteras de Francia, en un principio destino preferente, ha hecho que los flujos migratorios se reorienten hacia nuevos destinos: en primer lugar Italia y España, pero también Estados Unidos,[79]​ Canadá y, más recientemente, China.[80]​\n\nEl 15 de abril de 2010, Human Rights Watch publicó un informe en el que instaba a las autoridades senegalesas a regular todas las escuelas coránicas a las que asisten decenas de miles de niños. Estos niños talibé, estimados en 50.000 varones, sufren a veces abusos que les empujan al exilio.\n\nEn Senegal hay casi un millón de inmigrantes guineanos.\n\nEl sistema educativo de Senegal es uno de los más avanzados del continente. Senegal puede presumir de un alto nivel educativo[81]​ con títulos equivalentes a los de las universidades extranjeras más prestigiosas, tanto en Francia como en Estados Unidos.\n\nEsto permite también intercambios con estudiantes que vienen a estudiar a Senegal en el marco de estudios específicos sobre el país o estudiantes senegaleses que salen al extranjero para diversificar sus conocimientos en el marco de sus investigaciones.\n\nCon una población muy joven, la demanda de formación es muy elevada, por no hablar de los jóvenes de otros países africanos más pobres que intentan completar sus estudios en Dakar.\n\nA pesar de una tasa de éxito en el bachillerato similar en 2000 (37,67%) y 2011 (38,4%), el número de bachilleres ha pasado de 9.000 a 30.000 en los años transcurridos. Y naturalmente, el 80% de estos bachilleres buscaban matricularse en la universidad, «un objeto de promoción social y de orgullo, por el que las familias y los estudiantes están dispuestos a hacer enormes sacrificios», explica el investigador Olivier Provini, que trabaja en las reformas universitarias africanas.[82]​ El principal problema al que se enfrentan muchos bachilleres es el dominio del francés: a lo largo de su formación, tienen que hacer malabarismos entre el francés y la lengua nacional, el wolof.\n\nSe han creado nuevas universidades públicas en Bambey, Thiès y Ziguinchor, y se han aumentado los sueldos de los profesores bajo la presidencia de Abdoulaye Wade, lo que ha contribuido a frenar la fuga de cerebros académicos y a favorecer el regreso de algunos que estaban en Europa, Estados Unidos y otros lugares de África.[83]​ La Universidad de Kaolack abrirá pronto sus puertas bajo la presidencia del nuevo Presidente de la República, Macky Sall. Esta nueva universidad contribuirá a descongestionar las otras universidades del país, pero también a orientar a un gran número de estudiantes. También contribuirá al desarrollo de las demás regiones del país.\n\nSenegal es miembro de la Organización de la Francofonía (que en su día dirigió su expresidente Abdou Diouf) y se ha convertido en país observador en la Comunidad de Países de Lengua Portuguesa (CPLP). Senegal está considerando la posibilidad de convertirse en miembro de pleno derecho de la CPLP, a pesar de que el portugués sólo lo habla una proporción muy pequeña de la población. La segunda Universidad de Dakar y la Universidad de Sine Saloum abrirán sus puertas a principios de 2017.\n\nSenegal es conocido en toda África por su influencia y herencia musical, gracias a la popularidad del mbalax, que tiene su origen en la tradición percusiva serer. Esta música fue popularizada por Youssou N'Dour, entre otros, logrando gran éxito internacional. La percusión sabar es especialmente popular. El sabar se utiliza fundamentalmente en las celebraciones especiales, como bodas. Otro instrumento es el tama. Otros músicos populares de renombre internacional son Ismael Lô, Cheikh Lô, Orchestra Baobab, Baaba Maal, Akon, Thione Seck, Viviane, y Pape Diouf.\n\nSenegal es conocido por la tradición, típica de África Occidental, de la narración de historias, realizada por los griots, quienes han mantenido la historia de la región viva durante miles de años a través de sus palabras y música. La profesión del griot se pasa de generación en generación, y requiere de años de entrenamiento y aprendizaje en genealogía, historia y música. Los griots dan voz a generaciones y generaciones de la sociedad africana.[84]​\n\nSenegal es conocido comúnmente como «la tierra de la teranga». El término «teranga» hace referencia a los valores de hospitalidad, solidaridad y compartir. Se puede decir que el pueblo senegalés es muy colectivista.\n\nAdemás, en Senegal hay muchos grupos étnicos, como los soninke, manding, lebou, peulh, diola y toucouleur.\n\nJunto a los grupos étnicos están las castas. Los grupos étnicos y las castas no están vinculados. Los grupos étnicos representan agrupaciones culturales, mientras que el sistema de castas representa jerarquías sociales. Esta jerarquía social se basa en el oficio practicado por los antepasados hace muchos años.[85]​\n\nEl sistema de castas incluye a los nobles («geer»), que son agricultores y ganaderos, los griots («gewel»), cuya función es cantar las alabanzas de los nobles, y los artesanos («jef lekk»), que se dividen en varias categorías, como los «teug», que son herreros, los «ude», que son zapateros, los «laobé», que son ebanistas, y los «maabo», que son tejedores.\n\nAnteriormente, era el apellido el que identificaba la pertenencia[86]​ a una casta.[87]​ Además, el sistema de castas era muy visible. En la actualidad, esto sólo ocurre en algunas partes de Senegal, debido a la mezcla cultural.[88]​\n\nSin embargo, no está menos presente en la sociedad senegalesa. Este sistema crea discrepancias a varios niveles, como en el caso de los matrimonios: es muy difícil, si no imposible, que dos personas de castas diferentes se casen. Además, Senegal nunca ha tenido un presidente de una casta distinta a la noble.[89]​\n\nLa literatura senegalesa es una de las más importantes de África Occidental, tanto escrita como oral. La mayoría de sus obras están escritas en francés, pero también hay textos en árabe, wolof, peul, serere, diola, mandinga y soninké. La población de Senegal, sin contar las diásporas, será de unos 18 millones de habitantes en 2024 (frente a 2.416.000 en 1950 y 3.048.000 en 1960).[90]​\n\nLa literatura senegalesa es conocida en todo el mundo desde hace mucho tiempo principalmente a través de la figura excepcional de Léopold Sédar Senghor, poeta y estadista, campeón de la francofonía y paladín de la negritud.\n\nOtros autores ya clásicos son los novelistas Cheikh Hamidou Kane, Birago Diop, Boubacar Boris Diop, Mamadou Mahmoud N'Dongo y el poeta Alioune Badara Coulibaly, así como Ousmane Sembène, que llevará a la pantalla algunas de sus propias novelas. En el campo del ensayo, además de la obra de Cheikh Anta Diop, los trabajos y publicaciones del antropólogo Tidiane N'Diaye han adquirido una dimensión mundial.\n\nLas mujeres, por su parte, han sido especialmente activas e incisivas. En 1980, Mariama Bâ describió con gran sensibilidad la sociedad polígama en Une si longue lettre.[91]​ Aminata Sow Fall, en La Grève des bàttu[91]​ (1979), muestra que los pequeños no carecen de recursos. Fatou Diome conoció el éxito con Le Ventre de l'Atlantique4 (2004), una novela que describe, a menudo con humor, los sueños de evasión de los jóvenes senegaleses.\n\nEl cine senegalés está considerado como uno de los más antiguos y dinámicos de África, y sus películas ganan regularmente premios en festivales africanos e internacionales, sobre todo en Europa. La primera película senegalesa data de 1955, por lo que Senegal no esperó a la descolonización para crear películas, y fue sobre todo entre los años 60 y 80 cuando el cine senegalés consolidó su imagen de cine rico.\n\nAfrique sur Seine, realizado en 1955, es un cortometraje de Paulin Soumanou Vieyra, Jacques Mélo Kane y Mamadou Sarr. Aunque Afrique sur Seine no fue la primera película realizada por africanos subsaharianos, fue, y sigue siendo, considerada una piedra angular del cine africano en la medida en que representa las reivindicaciones de los pueblos colonizados para poder desarrollar y controlar su propia imagen en un momento en que la colonización tocaba a su fin. También establece la noción de la diáspora africana, que sigue siendo un tema fuerte en varios cines africanos y caribeños. Aunque fue rodada en Francia, la película está considerada como la primera película senegalesa, ya que fue dirigida, entre otros, por un director senegalés, y su argumento se centra en jóvenes senegaleses que viven en París.\n\nEn 1956, tras graduarse en el IDHEC como el primer africano en hacerlo, Paulin Soumanou Vieyra regresó a África con el Groupe Africain de Cinéma, un colectivo no legal que existió entre 1952 y 1966, y más concretamente a Senegal, donde comenzó su carrera como jefe de los noticiarios senegaleses. Desde muy pronto, creó la idea del panafricanismo y participó en la creación de FESPACO. Aprovechó su posición para filmar en Senegal y formar a técnicos y directores, entre ellos Ousmane Sembène. Juntos realizaron su primer cortometraje, Borom Sarret, en 1953.\n\nNo fue hasta 1966 cuando Ousmane Sembène realizó el primer largometraje de ficción del África subsahariana, La Noire de..., que ganó el premio Jean Vigo. Entretanto, se habían realizado varios cortometrajes de ficción y documentales que marcaron la pauta del cine senegalés: un cine documental o de ficción que exploraba el realismo social, así como las relaciones con Francia, los antiguos colonos y las secuelas de la colonización dentro de la propia sociedad senegalesa, para contar mejor las realidades del país. Las consignas del cine de la época eran películas baratas, políticas y panafricanas.\n\nEl cine senegalés entraba en su edad de oro. Impulsado por las políticas de subvenciones públicas y el éxito internacional de las películas producidas, el entusiasmo del público por estas películas llenó las salas de cine, incluso en Senegal. Las figuras más destacadas fueron Djibril Diop Mambety, cuyo Touki Bouki, de 1973, fue la primera película senegalesa seleccionada en Cannes. Antes que él, Ousmane Sembène ganó el Premio Internacional de la Crítica en el Festival de Venecia. También fue en 1972 cuando Safi Faye debutó en el cine con La passante, abriendo el camino a las cineastas africanas.\n\nEn 1999 se inauguró el Festival Internacional de Cine de Barrio de Dakar. A lo largo de los años, el festival se ha convertido en un trampolín para los jóvenes actores y directores senegaleses, pero no ha conseguido frenar el declive de la producción cinematográfica.\n\nA partir de los años 80, el cine senegalés empezó a debilitarse. Las salas cerraron una tras otra y los actores privados y públicos se retiraron. La producción disminuyó. En los años 2000, la producción había descendido a unas dos películas al año, que en cualquier caso tenían dificultades para llegar al público. De hecho, la mayoría de las películas senegalesas ya no son vistas por los propios senegaleses, sino en el extranjero.\n\nEn aquel momento, se calcula que había 5 salas de cine en Dakar. Desde entonces, operadores privados y públicos han reconstruido las salas, pero esto no basta para garantizar la proyección de películas en número suficiente para que su producción sea rentable. Sin embargo, la producción se ha recuperado, y ahora se realizan unas diez películas al año. La generación actual ha vivido el exilio, y los temas del cine senegalés han cambiado: ya no se trata tanto del colonialismo y los cambios de clase y religión en el seno de la sociedad senegalesa como de los que se van, por qué, adónde, y los que se quedan y experimentan la ausencia, como en Atlantique, de Mati Diop, que ganó el Gran Premio de Cannes en 2019.\n\nEl fútbol es un deporte muy popular en Senegal. La selección senegalesa de fútbol, cuyos jugadores son conocidos como los «Leones de Teranga», está afiliada a la Federación Senegalesa de Fútbol y a la FIFA desde 1962. En 2002, el equipo se clasificó para la fase final de la Copa Mundial de la FIFA en Corea y Japón. La selección senegalesa venció a Francia (vigente campeona del mundo y de Europa) en el partido inaugural del Mundial y se clasificó para los cuartos de final de la Copa del Mundo por primera vez en su historia al derrotar a Suecia por 2-1, convirtiéndose en la segunda selección africana en alcanzar los cuartos de final después de Camerún en 1990.[92]​\n\nTambién participó en el Mundial de 2018, pero no superó la primera ronda. A nivel continental, ganó la Copa Africana de Naciones en 2022[93]​ al vencer a Egipto en la final, tras haber llegado a la final en 2002 en Malí contra Camerún y en 2019 en Egipto contra Argelia. Entre los grandes futbolistas de Senegal figuran Sadio Mané, El-Hadji Diouf, Édouard Mendy, Henri Camara, Kalidou Koulibaly, Khalilou Fadiga, Idrissa Gueye, Habib Beye, Tony Sylva, Mamadou Niang, Omar Daf, Ferdinand Coly y, en el pasado, Jules Bocandé, así como el seleccionador Pape Diouf, antiguo presidente del OM. Senegal se proclamó campeón de África (2022) por primera vez en su historia al término de una final que estuvo a la altura de todas sus promesas.[94]​ Los Leones de la Teranga vencieron a los Faraones en el flamante Estadio Abdoulaye-Wade y se clasificaron para el Mundial de Catar.[95]​\n\nLa lucha senegalesa tiene sus raíces en la tradición.[96]​ La lucha senegalesa no ha perdido nada de su popularidad, con combates tan cortos como espectaculares. Este deporte se caracteriza por campeones impresionantes, como Yékini, que en 2005 venció a Tyson, un adversario formidable que ostentaba el título desde hacía casi cinco años, pero que fue derrotado en dos ocasiones por otro peso pesado senegalés, Sérigne Dia, conocido como Bombardier. En este deporte hay ahora importantes intereses económicos en juego. Hoy en día, los honorarios pueden alcanzar cerca de 350.000.000 FCFA, es decir, 750.000 dólares.\n\nTradición destinada a celebrar el final de la cosecha, la lucha se ha convertido en el deporte nacional, superando incluso al fútbol. Se juega en todas partes: clandestinamente, en terrenos baldíos, en torneos de aficionados y en campeonatos profesionales con cobertura mediática. La versión senegalesa, «con golpe», permite dar puñetazos para sorprender al adversario. Los luchadores son herederos de una cultura: se preparan rociándose con pócimas elaboradas según las recomendaciones de los marabouts.\n\nEl boxeo tuvo su apogeo con Battling Siki (1897-1925), campeón del mundo a los 25 años y primer africano en ganar un título mundial de boxeo.[97]​ Leonard Tavarez (francés pero nacido en Dakar) también fue campeón francés de peso ligero en 1969. Más cerca, Souleymane M'Baye (francés de origen senegalés) se convirtió en campeón francés de los pesos pesados del CMB. Mouhamed Ali Ndiaye (italiano pero nacido en Senegal) ha ostentado varios títulos internacionales en la categoría de peso pequeño.\n\nAunque el baloncesto[98]​ es menos popular que el fútbol, es un deporte muy practicado, impulsado por el éxito de su selección nacional de baloncesto, los Leones de Senegal, y jugadores como DeSagana Diop, Boniface N'Dong, El Kabir Pene, Maleye N'Doye, Xane d'Almeida y Gorgui Dieng, que en 2015, en su primer año con los Leones, fue el máximo anotador y reboteador del torneo. El equipo fue eliminado en semifinales por Nigeria, a la postre ganadora de la competición. Sin olvidar a las valientes leonas (Aya Traoré, Fatou Dieng, Mame-Marie Sy-Diop, Ndèye Sène, Aminata Dièye, Fatoumata Diango, Fatou Binetou Thiam, Bineta Diouf, Mame Diodio Diouf, Awa Guèye, Aminata Nar Diop y Oumoul Khairy Sarr) que, tras ganar la medalla de plata en Líbano en los VI Juegos de la Francofonía en septiembre de 2009, se proclamaron campeonas de la 21.ª Copa Africana de Naciones (CAN) en Madagascar en octubre de 2009.\n\nTambién ganaron la última Copa Africana de Naciones en octubre de 2015. Tras ganar la Copa Africana de Naciones de 2015, el Gobierno prometió a las leonas del baloncesto la construcción de un complejo deportivo, cuya inauguración estaba prevista para principios de 2017. En 2016 comenzaron las obras del Palacio Polideportivo en Diamniadio.[99]​\n\nOtros deportes también están bien representados: el equipo senegalés de pesca deportiva (Moussa Mbengue, Abdoulaye Kébé, Cyril Calendini, Dominique Dussaut) se proclamó campeón del mundo en 2002 y 2003.[100]​\n\nAtraídos por las condiciones climáticas, a menudo suaves, y los recursos costeros, muchos visitantes vienen a disfrutar de deportes náuticos como el submarinismo y el surf, y la reputación de las olas de Almadies y Ouakam está bien consolidada. La aviación de recreo -en particular el vuelo en ultraligero- ofrece un enfoque único del paisaje en una región sin verdaderas montañas.El Cap Skirring y el Sine Saloum son los destinos preferidos.Poco a poco, el skate empieza a cobrar importancia, con asociaciones y torneos y la creación de un skatepark en Dakar.\n• Patrimonio de la Humanidad en Senegal\n• Wikcionario tiene definiciones y otra información sobre Senegal.\n• Perfiles de países de la FAO: SenegalSenegal | Flag, Language, President, Population, & Indpendence | Britannica: Senegal, country in western Africa. Located at the westernmost point of the continent and served by multiple air and maritime travel routes, Senegal is known as the “Gateway to Africa.” The country lies at an ecological boundary where semiarid grassland, oceanfront, and tropical rainforest converge; this diverse environment has endowed Senegal with a wide variety of plant and animal life. It is from this rich natural heritage that the country’s national symbols were chosen: the baobab tree and the lion.\n\nThe region today known as Senegal was long a part of the ancient Ghana and Djolof kingdoms and an important node on trans-Saharan caravan routes. It was also an early point of European contact and was contested by England, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands before ultimately coming under French control in the late 19th century. It remained a colony of France until 1960, when, under the leadership of the writer and statesman Léopold Senghor, it gained its independence—first as part of the short-lived Mali Federation and then as a wholly sovereign state.\n\nAlthough Senegal traditionally has been dependent on peanuts (groundnuts), the government has had some success with efforts to diversify the country’s economy. Even so, the country suffered an economic decline in the 20th century, owing in some measure to external forces such as the fall in value of the African Financial Community (Communauté Financière Africaine; CFA) franc and the high cost of debt servicing, as well as to internal factors such as a rapidly growing population and widespread unemployment.\n\nAlmost two-fifths of Senegal’s people are Wolof, members of a highly stratified society whose traditional structure includes a hereditary nobility and a class of musicians and storytellers called griots. Contemporary Senegalese culture, especially its music and other arts, draws largely on Wolof sources, but the influences of other Senegalese groups (among them the Fulani, the Serer, the Diola, and the Malinke) are also evident. Wolof predominate in matters of state and commerce as well, and this dominance has fueled ethnic tension over time as less-powerful groups vie for parity with the Wolof majority.\n\nThe most important city in Senegal is its capital, Dakar. This lively and attractive metropolis, located on Cape Verde Peninsula along the Atlantic shore, is a popular tourist destination. Although the government announced plans to eventually move the capital inland, Dakar will remain one of Africa’s most important harbours and an economic and cultural centre for West Africa as a whole.\n\nSenegal is home to several internationally renowned musicians and artists. Other aspects of Senegalese culture have traveled into the larger world as well, most notably Senghor’s espousal of Negritude—a literary movement that flourished in the 1930s, ’40s, and ’50s and that emphasized African values and heritage. Through events such as the World Festival of Negro Arts, first held in Senegal in 1966, and institutions such as the Fundamental Institute of Black Africa (Institut Fondamental d’Afrique Noire; IFAN) and the Gorée Island World Heritage site, Senegal honours Senghor’s dictum \"We must learn to absorb and influence others more than they absorb or influence us.\"Flight tickets, booking cheap flights |official site|: This new national airline, Air Senegal, is at the heart of the Emerging Senegal Plan with the ambition to erect a real regional air hub around Blaise Diagne International Airport.

Medieval Europe and the premodern Mediterranean; Social History; Gender, Sexuality, & Women's History; Violence; Christian-Muslim-Jewish Relations.\n\nAs a historian of late medieval European history, I specialize in the study of gender and sexuality, women’s history, and the sociocultural interactions of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Iberia and the Mediterranean. Much of my research focuses on the intersection of masculinity, violence, the sexual practice of concubinage, and Mediterranean social customs.\n\nDefiant Priests: Domestic Unions, Violence, and Clerical Masculinity in Fourteenth-Century Catalunya (Cornell, 2017), my first book, investigates how long-standing concubinous unions and clerical violence shaped the masculinity of priests two hundred years after canon law prohibited the most visible markers of adult masculinity for men, such as wives, children, and weapons. This book offers an alternative narrative to the effects of the eleventh-century reform movement that imposed celibacy on clergymen in the major orders and challenges the common assertion that celibacy was the defining characteristic of the medieval priesthood. Defiant Priests has received three book awards from the Society for Medievalist Feminist Scholarship, the American Historical Association, and the American Catholic Historical Association.\n\nI also have a collection of essays Women & Community in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia, co-edited with Alexandra Guerson and Dana Wessell Lightfoot, that is forthcoming with the University of Nebraska’s Women and Gender in the Early Modern World series.\n\nMy current book project, On the Margins of Marriage, is a comparative study of concubinous unions among the peasantry, urban poor, and merchant class across the late medieval Mediterranean. It reveals how a concubinary relationship could be an important stage of life for both men and women as they transitioned into and out of marriage. This ambitious study is based on archival research in Barcelona and Valencia, Rome, Venice, Lucca, Pisa, and Palermo, as well as Marseille, Perpignan, Toulouse.\n\nI also draw parallels between Latin Christian merchants with Jewish and Muslim merchants, who likewise kept concubines that were often slave women from eastern Europe and Africa, to illustrate a commonality of sexual practices. My research exposes the significant population of enslaved, single, married women, and widows, who by circumstance or choice, ended up in an informal union to weave the experiences of women at the lowest levels of society into an account of medieval people who remained on the margins of marriage. Recently, this project has received support from the Institute for Advanced Study (2018-2019) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (2019-2020).Santiago Partida-Sanchez: My laboratory is interested in the study of immune cell recruitment induced by infection and/or inflammation. Our research projects are focused on molecular analyses of chemokine receptor-mediated G-protein-linked signaling and calcium influx in neutrophils and DCs. We are conducting experiments to study regulation of calcium influx mediated by CD38-catalyzed metabolites and the ADPR-activated calcium channel TRPM2 in inflammatory cells.\n\nWe would like to assess whether CD38 inhibiting drugs, CD38-derived antagonists, and/or TRPM2 channel inhibitors, have potential therapeutic use to block undesired chronic inflammatory responses, or harmful T cell responses leading to autoimmunity. This knowledge could allow us to design new strategies for clinical intervention in several immunological disorders, as well as inflammatory and infectious diseases."}

It stars Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt as the Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, alongside Tom Skerritt, Brenda Blethyn and Emily Lloyd.\n\nSet in and around Missoula, Montana, the story follows two sons of a Presbyterian minister, one studious and the other rebellious, as they grow up and come of age in the Rocky Mountain region during a span of time from roughly World War I to the early days of the Great Depression, including part of the Prohibition era.[2]\n\nThe film premiered at the 1992 Toronto International Film Festival, and was released in the United States on October 9. It received positive reviews and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Adapted Screenplay, and won Best Cinematography. Robert Redford was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director.\n\nThe Maclean brothers, Norman and Paul, grow up in Missoula, Montana, with their mother, Clara, and their father, Rev. John Maclean, a Presbyterian minister, from whom they learn a love of fly fishing for trout in the Blackfoot River. Norman and Paul are home-schooled under the strict moral and academic code of their father. Norman leaves to attend college at Dartmouth. Six years later, during the Prohibition era and the Jazz Age, he returns and finds that Paul has become a skilled fisherman and a hard-drinking investigative journalist working for a newspaper in Helena.\n\nNorman attends a Fourth of July dance and meets Jessie Burns, a flapper whose father runs the general store in Wolf Creek. Smitten, Norman calls her the next morning and sets up a double date. Norman and Jessie go on their first date at the Hot Springs speakeasy. Paul arrives with his date, a similarly hard-drinking Cheyenne woman named Mabel, who is treated as an inferior by the white crowd.\n\nAfter Paul is arrested for hitting a man who insulted Mabel, Norman is called to bait him out of jail. The desk sergeant says that Paul has angered local criminals by falling behind in his debts from a big poker game at the Lolo speakeasy. Norman offers to give money to Paul, who brushes him off.\n\nJessie eventually asks Norman to help her alcoholic brother Neal, who is visiting from Southern California. Norman and Paul dislike Neal, but at Jessie's insistence they invite him to go fly fishing. Neal shows up drunk with Rawhide, a prostitute he met the night before. Norman and Paul get separated from Neal but fish anyway and return to their car hours later to find that Neal and Rawhide have drunk all the beer, had sex, and passed out naked.\n\nNorman drives an intoxicated Neal home, where Jessie is enraged that the brothers left Neal alone with the beer instead of fishing with him. Norman tells Jessie that he is falling in love with her. Jessie drives away angry but a week later asks Norman to come to the train station to see Neal off. After the train departs, Jessie laments her failure to save Neal from his alcoholism. Norman shows Jessie a letter from the University of Chicago offering him a faculty position in the Department of English Literature. He tells Jessie that he does not wish to leave Montana and when it becomes clear that it is because of her, she embraces him.\n\nThat night, a drunken Norman meets up with Paul and announces his love for Jessie. Paul says that they should celebrate but instead takes Norman to the Lolo speakeasy. Paul tries to get in on the poker game in the backroom, but the dealer will not let him play because he already owes so much. Paul tells Norman that he is not leaving since he is feeling lucky and that he will convince the others to let him play. Norman reluctantly drives off after Paul asks him to go fishing the next day.\n\nNorman is relieved when Paul arrives the following morning, as he feared for his brother's life. Norman tells his family that he is going to accept the job in Chicago. Norman, Paul, and their father go fly fishing one last time. Norman urges his brother to come with him and Jessie to Chicago, but Paul says that he will never leave Montana. He hooks a huge rainbow trout that drags him down the river rapids before he lands it. William says that Paul has become a wonderful fisherman and an artist in the craft, much to Paul's delight.\n\nBefore Norman is to leave for Chicago, police inform him that Paul was beaten to death. Norman breaks the news to his parents. Years later, Mrs. Maclean, Norman, Jessie, and their two children listen to a sermon given by Rev. Maclean soon before his own death. Rev. Maclean preaches about being unable to help loved ones who are destroying themselves and will not accept help. All that those who truly care for such a self-destructive person can do, Rev. Maclean concludes, is to give unconditional love, even without understanding why.\n\nIn 1976, the same year the novella A River Runs Through It and Other Stories was published, Richard Sylbert optioned the film rights to it, with William Hjortsberg attached as writer. However, the option gradually lapsed without further updates on the adaptation. This made author Norman Maclean distrustful of Hollywood, with any further attempts to option the novella, including one by William Hurt, being met with immediate reluctance from Maclean for the next ten years.[1]\n\nRobert Redford, who had read the novella in 1980, said he was \"immediately captivated by it\", appreciating Maclean's depiction of the American West and feeling a strong connection to the Scottish immigrant protagonists, being of Scottish-Irish heritage himself. Over the course of six weeks, Redford and Maclean met thrice to discuss the former's vision for a film adaptation. Maclean was impressed, granting Redford an option which allowed Maclean first-draft script approval. However, Maclean died in August 1990, before production even began on the film, leading to surviving family members including his daughter and son-in-law to discuss the script instead. In October 1987, the Los Angeles Herald Examiner reported that Redford's Northfork Productions would produce the adaptation; John Sacret Young was initially attached as screenwriter, but neither was he mentioned in further updates, nor is he credited onscreen.[1]\n\nProvisions of finance and distribution for A River Runs Through It had been precarious for much of the pre-production stage. Northfork and Cineplex Odeon entered a joint venture in October 1987 to co-finance low budget films in the $5-6 million range, this film being one of them, but this arrangement fell through when Cineplex Odeon's distribution arm collapsed. Eventually, Carolco Pictures agreed to finance the film under the condition that Redford kept the budget below $10 million and agreed to act in one of their future films. The company would also acquire worldwide distribution rights, with domestic distribution handled by Seven Arts, Carolco's joint venture with New Line Cinema. However, owing to financial troubles, Carolco dropped out as well. Finally, Jake Eberts, who had been trying to option the novel previously, immediately joined as financier when Redford took the project to Allied Filmmakers; Variety initially reported that Carolco would co-finance and retain worldwide distribution, but the company ultimately dropped out of the project.[1]\n\nScreenwriter Richard Friedenberg was initially skeptical about adapting the novella and turned it down, fearing he would write a \"fishing movie\". Friedenberg ultimately signed on, conducting extensive research, with Maclean's surviving daughter and son-in-law providing him with old yearbooks and love letters between Maclean and his wife Jessie. Friedenberg's screenplay made some changes to the novella, including rearranging chronological events and shortening them into a smaller time frame and making the details of Paul Maclean's murder clearer than they were in the novella. Wanting to preserve Maclean's language from the original, Redford made the decision to add narration using lines from the novella verbatim. For this purpose, he auditioned 26 actors and author Wallace Stegner. Unsatisfied with the auditions, Redford decided to provide narration himself, despite concerns over it coming off as egocentric and self-indulgent.[1]\n\nAlthough both the book and movie are set in Missoula and on the Blackfoot River, it was filmed in late June to early July 1991 in south central Montana in Livingston and Bozeman,[2] and on the nearby upper Yellowstone, Gallatin, and Boulder Rivers. The waterfall shown is Granite Falls, in the mountains 18 miles (29 km) southwest of Jackson, Wyoming.[3][4] Filming was completed in early September 1991.\n\nAn article published in the Helena Independent Record in July 2000, based on recollections of people who knew both brothers, noted a number of specifics about the Macleans — notably various chronological and educational details about Paul Maclean's adult life — that differ somewhat from their portrayal in the film and novella.[5]\n\nMark Isham, who would go on to compose the scores to most Robert Redford-directed films, composed the musical score for the film. Originally, Elmer Bernstein was hired to score the film. However, after Redford and Bernstein disagreed over the tone of the music, Bernstein was replaced by Isham.[6] Rushed for time, Isham completed the score within four weeks at Schnee Studio of Signet Sound Studios in Hollywood, California. Upon release, the music was met with positive reviews earning the film nominations for both Grammy and Academy Awards. The A River Runs Through It (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) was released on October 27, 1992.[7]\n\nCineplex Odeon as well as Carolco Pictures and its company Seven Arts were attached as distributors of the film at various points during pre-production. Michael Nathanson, worldwide production president at Columbia Pictures, kept close contact with Redford for one and a half years before the studio was shown a rough cut of the film. Columbia ultimately won the domestic distribution rights to it for $8 million in May 1992, beating out Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. and the Walt Disney Studios; this would mark Columbia's first acquisition of a completed film since Mark Canton became its head in 1991.[1]\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 1992, followed by benefit screenings in Bozeman, Montana on September 19 and at the AMPAS Theater on October 2. The film's Bozeman screening raised several thousand dollars, donated towards the restoration of the Big Blackfoot River, while the AMPAS screening raised $45,000 for Redford's Sundance Institute. Its limited theatrical release began in the United States on October 9, 1992 with twelve screens, which doubled the following week and expanded to 130 in the third week. On October 30, 1992, having grossed $2.9 million domestically in 19 days, the number of screens expanded to 800.[8][1]\n\nA River Runs Through It was originally released on VHS and LaserDisc on May 19, 1993.[9] It was released on DVD in 1999 and a deluxe DVD edition in 2005 in similar packaging style as Legends Of The Fall, which also received a deluxe edition dvd release that year.[10] It was reissued on Blu-ray in July 2009 by Sony Pictures with six extra features including 17 deleted scenes and a documentary titled Deep Currents: Making 'A River Runs Through It' with interview segments of the cast and crew.[11]\n\nReleased on October 9, 1992, the film grossed $43,440,294 in the United States and Canada.[12] In 1993, it grossed $22.9 million for a worldwide total of over $66 million.[13]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 6.79/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"Tasteful to a fault, this period drama combines a talented cast (including a young Brad Pitt) with some stately, beautifully filmed work from director Robert Redford.\"[14] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[15] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[16]\n\nRoger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. He wrote:\n\nMuch of the praise focused on Pitt's portrayal of Paul, which has been cited as his career-making performance.[18] Despite the critical reception, Pitt was very critical of his performance on the film: \"Robert Redford made a quality movie. But I don't think I was skilled enough. I think I could have done better. Maybe it was the pressure of the part, and playing someone who was a real person — and the family was around occasionally — and not wanting to let Redford down.\"[19]\n\nThe following quote from the film, which is not present in the novella, is displayed at the base of the statue of Michael Jordan at Chicago's United Center:\n• A River Runs Through It at IMDb\n• A River Runs Through It at the TCM Movie Database\n• A River Runs Through It at the AFI Catalog of Feature FilmsA River Runs Through It (1992) ⭐ 7.2 | Drama: When I first saw this movie I was with my dad. He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites. After watching the movie it instantly became one of mine. \n\n\n\nA River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the older of the two brothers and sets out on the path of education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles. \n\n\n\nThe story follows these characters as the each walk their own path. There is no downside to this film. You will be entertained the whole way through. The acting, directing, and script are all perfect. The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score. Both bring you into the world Robert Redford creates. \n\n\n\nThis is an all around great film that is destined to be a classic. It sure is in my book. If you haven't seen it definitely watch it as soon as you can, because it will stay with you forever.Amazon.com: A River Runs Through It and Other Stories, Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition: 0783324920680: Maclean, Norman: Libros: Cuando un producto es enviado por Amazon, el vendedor utilizará Logística de Amazon para realizar el envío.

Más información sobre el programa.A River Runs Through It: A very thoughtful movie about family and nature. This is a great movie Robert Redford captures the beauty of the wilderness of Montana and the story is great. I did not know this movie was based on true events I found that out by reading the back of the case to be honest I bought the soundtrack and listened to it then I wanted to know what the movie was about I had a feeling it had to do with fishing because of the booklet that came with the soundtrack but the movie is more than that. It’s too bad that Norman McLean died before the movie shot he never got to see it and I have to hand it to Robert for the respect he gave Norman and the trust he gained from him to make this movie if Robert did not get that trust this movie may have not been made. The fact that everyone wanted to Honor him by doing the movie right is amazing that is true respect. The movie starts out slow but the story and the scenery engulfs you into the movie. There is not much more to say outside of this was a great watch in my opinion. The acting, directing, cinematography and music is great in this movie. If you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do So enjoyed this film , I have watched it twice, I must confess I love Robert Redford 's way of bring stories to life. I travelled to Montana and Yellowstone , and saw fly fishing. For a kid from Sydney, to see the mountains and the rivers was an wonderful experience. I was reminded of this when I watched the movie, to think of a young Brad Pitt, and Brendan Blythen, who later played Vera. I hope others enjoy the story of a family and how fly fishing , it's discipline and skill was what they had in common. Cheers , Mary It's a good movie in which not all that much happens. Still it's never boring. Scenery is great and it's very recommendable. I've got great memories watching this with my dad when I was younger. Watched it again recently and just loved the sets and locations it was shot at. Absolute classic I drank four beers while watching this and would have drank another but decided to go fishing insteadFILMAK: Machine realized to apply transparent protective film on finished surfaces of linear profiles.

She was a member of the Refugee Olympic Athletes Team (ROT) that competed under the Olympic flag at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.[1] On 27 April 2017, Mardini was appointed a UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador.[2] She also competed in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo with the Refugee Olympic Team (EOR).[3] She was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2023, alongside her sister, Sarah.[4]\n\nMardini was born to a Sunni Syrian family. Growing up in Damascus, Syria,[5] Mardini trained in swimming with the support of the Syrian Olympic Committee.[6] In 2012, she represented Syria in the 2012 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) 200 metre individual medley, 200 metre freestyle and 400 metre freestyle events.[7]\n\nMardini's house was destroyed in the Syrian Civil War.[8] Mardini and her sister Sarah decided to flee Syria in August 2015. They reached Lebanon, and then Turkey, where they arranged to be smuggled into Greece by boat with 18 other migrants, though the boat was meant to be used by no more than 6 or 7 people. After the motor stopped working and the dinghy began to take on water in the Aegean Sea, Yusra, Sarah, and two other people who were able to swim jumped into the water and pushed and pulled the boat through the water for over 3 hours until the group reached the island of Lesbos.[9] They then traveled on foot through Europe to Germany, where they settled in Berlin in September 2015.[6] Her parents and younger sister, Shahed, also fled Syria and live in Germany.[10]\n\nOn arrival in Germany, Mardini continued her training with her coach Sven Spannekrebs from Wasserfreunde Spandau 04 in Berlin, in hopes of qualifying for the Olympics.[6][9] She attempted to qualify in the 200 metres freestyle swimming event,[8] and in June 2016, Mardini was one of ten athletes selected for the newly formed Refugee Olympic Team.[11] Mardini competed in the 100 metres freestyle and the 100 metres butterfly at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio.[12] She won a 100m butterfly heat against four other swimmers, with a time of 1:09.21 and a rank of 41st among 45 entrants, but did not qualify for the semi-finals.[13][14][15]\n\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said of the refugee athletes, \"We help them to make their dream of sporting excellence come true, even when they have to flee war and violence.\"[16]\n\nMardini also competed at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo. She carried the flag of the IOC Refugee Olympic Team in the athletes’ parade of the opening ceremony. In the women's 100m butterfly, she swam a time of 1:06.78 in the heats, and was eliminated from the next rounds for which only the top 16 women qualified.[17][18]\n\nAfter her decision to end her swimming career, Mardini moved to Los Angeles in 2022 to study Cinema and Visual arts at the University of Southern California.[20]\n\nIn May 2017, Mardini became the youngest-ever Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Since then, she has met and encouraged refugees for example in Zaatari camp, Jordan, spoken at numerous high-level advocacy meetings and media interviews as well as in schools.[21] In October of the same year, Mardini joined a team of international athletes to represent the Under Armour sports brand. Chris Bate, Under Armour managing director in Europe, said: \"We are inspired by her drive and accomplishments, both as a person and as an athlete.\"[22]\n\nOn 20 June 2023, the UN World Refugee Day, she officially started the Yusra Mardini Foundation to support sports and education for refugee communities.she was really kind\n\nAt the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, Mardini was hired by Eurosport and Discovery TV channels to report on the Refugee Olympic Team.[25]\n\nMardini's story is told in the short story collection Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls, by Elena Favilli and Francesca Cavallo. The story is illustrated by JM Cooper,[26] and when the story was released as a podcast episode it was narrated by American journalist and long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad.[27] Further, Irish musician Declan O'Rourke penned the song \"Olympian\" to recall Yusra's story.[28]\n\nOn 3 May 2018, her autobiography Butterfly: From Refugee to Olympian - My Story of Rescue, Hope, and Triumph was published.[29] In November 2022, a biographical film, inspired by Mardini's life and titled The Swimmers, was theatrically released and distributed on Netflix later the same month. The film stars Manal Issa, Nathalie Issa, and Ahmed Malek.[30]\n• Official website of the Yousra Mardini FoundationYusra Mardini: Finding refuge in Germany, Yusra was then selected to compete as part of the inaugural Refugee Olympic Team at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and then again in Tokyo four years later. Having previously written about her struggle with the title ‘refugee’, she became the proud flagbearer and spokesperson for the team at the 2020 games. From there, Yusra went on to address world leaders at the UN General Assembly, meet the Pope, and receive several prestigious awards. She has since become a prominent speaker and sports advocate, while also completing her studies at university in the USA.\n\nYusra’s incredible story is told in her memoir, ‘Butterfly: From Refugee to Olympian – My Story of Rescue, Hope and Triumph’ and in Netflix’s The Swimmers, which was released in 2022 to widespread admiration across the globe.

Before his tenure as president, he previously served as President of the Supreme Audit Office from 1992 to 1995 and later Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutor General in Jerzy Buzek's cabinet from 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001.\n\nBorn in Warsaw, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, The Two Who Stole the Moon, with his identical twin brother Jarosław. Kaczyński was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980, he was awarded his Ph.D. by Gdańsk University. In 1990, he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gdańsk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.\n\nDuring the communist period, Kaczyński was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers' Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gdańsk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an \"anti-socialist element\". After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity. When Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to Lech Wałęsa and his Solidarity Citizens' Committee in 1988.\n\nFrom February to April 1989, he participated in the Polish Round Table Talks along with his brother. After Solidarity's victory in the 1989 Polish legislative election, Kaczyński became a senator and vice-chairman of the movement. Then in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, he was elected into the Sejm as a non-party member. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski's government. In 2001, Kaczyński co-founded the Law and Justice party, after splitting from the Solidarity Electoral Action and the Christian National Union, along with his brother.[1][2] Kaczyński was the party's presidential candidate, during the 2005 Polish presidential election. In the first round of voting, Kaczyński received 33.1% of the valid votes. In the second round of voting, Kaczyński received 54.04% of the vote, defeating Donald Tusk, who received 45.96% of the vote. He was sworn in as president on 23 December 2005.\n\nOn 10 July 2006, Kaczyński appointed his brother as Prime Minister of Poland upon the resignation of Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz, the brothers then became the first pair of brothers in the world to serve as president and Prime Minister of a country and the only twin brothers to do so, until 2007, when his brother lost the parliamentary election on 21 October 2007, finishing a distant second behind the conservative-liberal party Civic Platform. His brother was succeeded as prime minister by his former presidential rival Donald Tusk.[3]\n\nOn 10 April 2010, Lech Kaczyński died, along with his wife, in the crash of a Polish Air Force jet that occurred on a landing attempt at Smolensk North Airport in Russia.[4][5] He was the first Polish president to die in office since the assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz.\n\nKaczyński was born in Warsaw, the son of Rajmund[6] (an engineer who served as a soldier of the Armia Krajowa in World War II and a veteran of the Warsaw Uprising),[7] and Jadwiga (a philologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences).[8] As a child, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, The Two Who Stole the Moon (Polish title O dwóch takich, co ukradli księżyc), with his identical twin brother Jarosław.\n\nKaczyński was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980 he was awarded his PhD by Gdańsk University. In 1990 he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gdańsk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński University in Warsaw.\n\nIn the 1970s Kaczyński was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers' Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gdańsk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an anti-socialist element. After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity.\n\nWhen Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczyński was an active adviser to Lech Wałęsa and his Komitet Obywatelski Solidarność in 1988. From February to April 1989, he participated in the Round Table talks.\n\nKaczyński was elected senator in the elections of June 1989 and became the vice-chairman of the Solidarity trade union.[9] In the 1991 parliamentary election, he was elected to the parliament as a non-party member. He was, however, supported by the electoral committee Center Civic Alliance, closely related but not identical to the political party Centre Agreement (Porozumienie Centrum) led by his brother. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wałęsa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wałęsa nominated Kaczyński to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski's government.[10]\n\nKaczyński was the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control (Najwyższa Izba Kontroli, NIK) from February 1992 to May 1995[11] and later Minister of Justice and Attorney General in Jerzy Buzek's government from June 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001. During this time he was very popular because of his strong stance against corruption.[12]\n\nIn 2001 he founded the political party Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwość – PiS), usually labelled 'conservative' by media, with his brother Jarosław. Lech Kaczyński was the president of the party between 2001 and 2003.[13]\n\nIn 2002, Kaczyński was elected mayor of Warsaw in a landslide victory.[14] He started his term in office by declaring war on corruption. He strongly supported the construction of the Warsaw Uprising Museum and in 2004 appointed a historical panel to estimate material losses that were inflicted upon the city by the Germans in the Second World War (an estimated 85% of the city was destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising) as a direct response to heightened claims coming from German expellees from Poland. The panel estimated the losses to be at least 45.3 billion euros ($54 billion) in current value. He also supported the construction of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw and was one of the signatories of the agreement to finance the project using the city funds.[15]\n\nKaczyński banned the Warsaw gay pride parade twice in 2004 and again in 2005, locally known as the Parada Równości (the Equality Parade), telling protesters that \"I respect your right to demonstrate as citizens, but not as homosexuals.\"[16] Additionally, he feared the parade would promote a \"homosexual lifestyle\" and complained that police did not use enough force in breaking it up by stating \"Why was force not used to break up an illegal demonstration?\".[17][18] Kaczyński referred to the organizers of the gay pride parades as \"perverts\".[19]\n\nIn 2005, Kaczyński allowed a counter-demonstration, the \"Parade of Normality\",[20] organized by the All-Polish Youth, a Catholic nationalist organization opposed to \"liberalism, tolerance, and relativism.\"\n\nIn 2007, Poland was found guilty by the European Court of Human Rights of violating the principle of freedom of assembly by banning the 2005 Parada Równości under Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights.[21][22][23]\n\nOn 19 March 2005, he formally declared his intention to run for president in the October 2005 election.\n\nIn the first round of the elections he polled 33% of the vote, taking second place behind Donald Tusk. By the second round, however, he had gained the support of Radio Maryja, as well as of two other political parties besides his own: Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, and the Polish People's Party.\n\nElected President of the Republic of Poland (he defeated the runner-up Donald Tusk by polling 8,257,468 votes, constituting 54.04 percent of the vote), Kaczyński assumed office on 23 December 2005, taking an oath before the National Assembly.\n\nIn his first public speech as president-elect, Kaczyński said that his presidency would pursue the task of ameliorating the Republic, a process which he said would consist of \"purging various pathologies from our life, most prominently crime [...], particularly criminal corruption – that entire, great rush to obtain unjust enrichment, a rush that is poisoning society, [and preventing the state from ensuring] elementary social security, health security, basic conditions for the development of the family [and] the security of commerce and the basic conditions for economic development.\"[24]\n\nDuring his inauguration he stated several goals he would pursue during his presidency. Among those concerning internal affairs were: increasing social solidarity in Poland, bringing justice to those who were responsible for, or were affected by communist crimes in the People's Republic of Poland, fighting corruption, providing security in economy, and safety for development of family. Kaczyński also stated that he would seek to abolish economic inequalities between various regions of Poland. In his speech he also emphasized combining modernization with tradition and remembering the teachings of Pope John Paul II.\n\nOn 21 December 2008, Kaczyński became the first Polish head of state to visit a Polish synagogue and to attend religious services held there. His attendance coincided with the first night of Hanukkah.[25]\n\nKaczyński supported the reintroducing the death penalty in Poland, clashing with the European Union over the issue in 2006.[26][27][28]\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, in accordance with article 133 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland, Kaczyński pardoned 77 people and declined to pardon 550.\n\nIn foreign policy, Kaczyński noted that many of Poland's problems were related to the lack of energy security and this issue would have to be resolved to protect Polish interests. Strengthening ties with the United States while continuing to develop relations within the European Union are two main goals of Polish foreign affairs, as well as improving relations with France and Germany despite several problems in relations with the latter. Aside from those issues, his immediate goals were to develop a tangible strategic partnership with Ukraine and greater co-operation with the Baltic states, Azerbaijan and Georgia. He was greatly admired in Israel because he promoted educating Polish youth about the Holocaust. There was widespread grief in Israel over his death.[29]\n\nDefense Minister Radosław Sikorski compared the planned Russia to Germany gas pipeline to the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact and Foreign Minister Anna Fotyga stated that the pipeline was a threat to Poland's energy security.[30]\n\nIn November 2006 in Helsinki, at a European Union-Russia meeting, Poland vetoed the launch of EU-Russia partnership talks due to a Russian ban on Polish meat and plant products imports.[31]\n\nAs a reaction to claims by a German exile group Preussische Treuhand, which represents post-1945 German expellees from Eastern Europe, the Polish Foreign Minister Fotyga mistakenly threatened to reopen a 1990 Treaty fixing the Oder and Neisse rivers as the border between the two countries instead of the Neighborhood Treaty signed in the same year.[32][33]\n\nFollowing the military conflict between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Kaczyński provided the website of the President of Poland for dissemination of information for blocked by the Russian Federation Georgian internet portals. In a speech during the Russian aggression against Georgia, Kaczyński predicted: \"Today Georgia, tomorrow Ukraine, the Baltic States the day after tomorrow, and then perhaps the time will come for my country, Poland!\"[34]\n\nDuring a state visit to Serbia in 2009, Kaczyński said that the Polish government, on the basis of its constitutional competences, decided to recognize Kosovo and emphasized that he, as the President of the state, did not agree with that.[35]\n\nKaczyński married economist Maria Kaczyńska in 1978.[36] They had one daughter, Marta Kaczyńska-Dubieniecka. His brother is Jarosław Kaczyński, the former Prime Minister of Poland.[37]\n\nOn 10 April 2010, a Tupolev Tu-154M plane was carrying Lech Kaczyński, his wife Maria Kaczyńska, and other members of a Polish delegation (top public and military figures) from Warsaw to commemorate the Katyn massacre. The plane crashed while approaching Smolensk Air Base in Russia. The governor of Smolensk Oblast confirmed to the Russia 24 news channel that there were no survivors.[38] 96 people were killed in the crash, including many of Poland's highest military and civilian leaders.[39][40]\n\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a government commission to investigate the crash. Russia's Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, was placed in charge of the investigation.[41]\n\nRussian politician Valeriya Novodvorskaya later claimed the Russian government had murdered Kaczyński.[42]\n\nOn 11 April 2010, President Kaczyński's body was returned to Poland,[43] where he and his wife lay in state at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.[44] The state funeral was held in Kraków on 18 April 2010. After a Roman Catholic Mass at St. Mary's Basilica,[45] the presidential couple were laid to rest in a coffin, which was placed in the antechamber of the Crypt Under the Tower of Silver Bells beneath the Wawel Cathedral.[46][47][48] A significant number of foreign dignitaries were unable to attend the funeral as a result of air travel disruption in Europe following the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland.[49]\n\nIn June 2016, the Polish government announced it would re-open the investigation into the Smolensk jet crash with plans to exhume and autopsy all 96 of the victims.[50] On 14 November 2016, the first of ten bodies, including Kaczyński's, were exhumed.[51] Kaczyński and his wife were reburied on 18 November 2016 after autopsies.[52]\n\nBy 1 June 2017, exhumations of 27 coffins had been completed and DNA tests confirmed that 24 of those coffins, Kaczyński's among them, showed evidence of mix-ups, including switched bodies, partial sets of remains and multiple remains in one grave.[53]\n• Poland:\n• Knight of the Order of the White Eagle\n• Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta\n• Croatia:\n• Recipient of the Grand Order of King Tomislav (10 January 2008)\n• Czech Republic:\n• Member 1st Class of the Order of the White Lion (21 January 2010)\n• Georgia:\n• Recipient of the Order of National Hero of Georgia (posthumously, 10 April 2010) 54\n• Recipient of the St. George's Order of Victory (23 November 2007)\n• Hungary:\n• Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (18 March 2009)\n• Lithuania:\n• Commander Grand Cross with Golden Chain of the Order of Vytautas the Great (16 April 2009)\n• Sovereign Military Order of Malta:\n• Grand Cross Special Class of the Order pro Merito Melitensi (14 May 2007)\n• Portugal:\n• Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (2 September 2008)\n• Romania:\n• Collar of the Order of the Star of Romania (7 October 2009)\n• Saudi Arabia:\n• Collar of the Order of Abdulaziz al Saud (25 June 2007)\n• Slovakia:\n• Member 1st Class of the Order of the White Double Cross (21 February 2009) 55\n• Ukraine:\n• Member 1st Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (6 December 2007)\n• Georgia : Honorary doctorate from the Tbilisi State University in Georgia (16 April 2007)\n• South Korea : Honorary doctorate from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul (6 December 2008)\n• official website of the President of the Republic of Poland Archived 17 July 2018 at the Wayback Machine\n• Full text of the speech that President Lech Kaczyński would have delivered at Katyn\n• \"The Death of a President: Countdown To the Crash of Flight PLF 101\" by Leszek Misiak, Grzegorz WierzchołowskiLech Kaczyński – Wikipedia, wolna encyklopedia: Lech Aleksander Kaczyńskiⓘ (ur. 18 czerwca 1949 w Warszawie, zm. 10 kwietnia 2010 w Smoleńsku) – polski polityk i prawnik.

Jego ojciec, Rajmund Kaczyński, z zawodu inżynier, był żołnierzem Armii Krajowej, uczestnikiem powstania warszawskiego, kawalerem Orderu Virtuti Militari[3]. Matka, Jadwiga z domu Jasiewicz, z wykształcenia była filologiem polskim (zawodowo związana z Instytutem Badań Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk)[4].

W latach 1996–1999 był pracownikiem naukowym Wydziału Prawa i Administracji Uniwersytetu Gdańskiego (zajmując stanowisko profesora nadzwyczajnego), a od 1999 Wydziału Prawa i Administracji Uniwersytetu Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie (również na stanowisku profesora nadzwyczajnego). Został urlopowany w związku z prezydenturą.\n\nBył autorem publikacji z dziedziny prawa pracy: Ocena nowelizacji kodeksu pracy (1996)[17], Przewodnik do nauki prawa pracy (1998)[18]. W trakcie pracy naukowej pod jego kierunkiem powstała jedna rozprawa doktorska (Związkowa zdolność układowa, obroniona w 1999 przez Jakuba Stelinę z UG)[16].\n\nW 1971 przeprowadził się do Sopotu[19]. Jesienią 1977 za pośrednictwem brata Jarosława nawiązał współpracę z Biurem Interwencyjnym Komitetu Samoobrony Społecznej „KOR”, kierowanym przez Zofię i Zbigniewa Romaszewskich. Prowadził szkolenia z zakresu prawa pracy dla robotników. Od 1978 działał w Wolnych Związkach Zawodowych. W latach 1978–1980 wraz z Joanną i Andrzejem Gwiazdami prowadził dla robotników wykłady z prawa pracy i historii PRL. Pisywał w niezależnym „Robotniku Wybrzeża” oraz kolportował wśród robotników pisma „Robotnik” i „Biuletyn Informacyjny KSS „KOR””.\n\nW 1981 został delegatem gdańskiego Niezależnego Samorządnego Związku Zawodowego „Solidarność” na I Zjazd Krajowy Delegatów związku w Gdańsku; wybrano go na członka komisji programowej. Przewodniczył zespołowi do spraw uregulowania stosunków z Polską Zjednoczoną Partią Robotniczą.\n\nW czasie stanu wojennego był internowany w Strzebielinku[20] od 13 grudnia 1981 do 15 października 1982[21]. Od 1983 brał udział w posiedzeniach Tymczasowej Komisji Koordynacyjnej oraz w pracach tajnej Regionalnej Komisji Koordynacyjnej NSZZ „Solidarność”. Od 1985 wchodził w skład regionalnej Rady Pomocy Więźniom Politycznym w Gdańsku. W czasie strajków w 1988 w maju i sierpniu był doradcą (razem ze swoim bratem Jarosławem) robotników strajkujących w Stoczni Gdańskiej[22].\n\nPod koniec lat 80. stał się bliskim współpracownikiem Lecha Wałęsy, lidera „Solidarności” i późniejszego prezydenta Polski. 16 września 1988 brał udział w rozmowach „Solidarności” z przedstawicielami władz w Magdalence pod Warszawą. Od grudnia tego roku należał do Komitetu Obywatelskiego przy Lechu Wałęsie.\n\nOd lutego do kwietnia 1989 brał udział w obradach tzw. podstolików powstałych w związku z rozmowami Okrągłego Stołu (gdzie zasiadał w zespole do spraw pluralizmu związkowego). Od kwietnia 1989 wchodził w skład prezydium Krajowej Komisji Wykonawczej NSZZ „Solidarność”. W lipcu i sierpniu 1989 był ze strony NSZZ „Solidarność” członkiem zespołu ds. negocjacji ze Stronnictwem Demokratycznym i Zjednoczonym Stronnictwem Ludowym w sprawie powołania koalicyjnego rządu[23].\n\nW maju 1990 został wybrany na pierwszego wiceprzewodniczącego Komisji Krajowej NSZZ „Solidarność” (kierował praktycznie związkiem w czasie kampanii prezydenckiej Lecha Wałęsy i po jego wyborze na stanowisko prezydenta RP). Zrezygnował z funkcji po przegranej walce z Marianem Krzaklewskim o stanowisko przewodniczącego „Solidarności” w lutym 1991. Był później pierwszym przewodniczącym rady nadzorczej Fundacji na rzecz Polskich Związków Kredytowych, związanej z powstającym systemem spółdzielczych kas oszczędnościowo-kredytowych (SKOK)[24].\n\nBył senatorem I kadencji (1989–1991) i członkiem Obywatelskiego Klubu Parlamentarnego[1].

Sześcioletniej kadencji nie ukończył, gdyż w 1995 uchwałami Sejmu (z 26 maja) i Senatu (z 8 czerwca) został odwołany z tego urzędu. W wyborach parlamentarnych w 1993 startował bez powodzenia z listy komitetu wyborczego PC-Zjednoczenie Polskie w okręgu nowosądeckim.\n\nBył kandydatem na urząd prezydenta RP w wyborach w 1995[26]. Zrezygnował 30 października (jeszcze przed pierwszą turą głosowania), zgłaszając gotowość poparcia każdego, kto – jego zdaniem – miał szansę pokonać Lecha Wałęsę (wymienił wówczas Hannę Gronkiewicz-Waltz, Jana Olszewskiego, a także Jacka Kuronia).\n\n14 czerwca 2000 został powołany przez prezydenta Aleksandra Kwaśniewskiego na urząd ministra sprawiedliwości w rządzie Jerzego Buzka, stając się następcą Hanny Suchockiej. Stanowisko to zajmował do 5 lipca 2001. Jako prokurator generalny wydał w 2000 wytyczne dla prokuratorów, aby w większości spraw określonego rodzaju występowali do sądów o zastosowanie tymczasowego aresztowania wobec podejrzanych. Późniejsze stosowanie tymczasowego aresztowania skutkowało w grudniu 2007 tzw. sygnalizacją Europejskiego Trybunału Praw Człowieka, kwestionującą w opinii tego trybunału zbyt częste i nieuzasadnione orzekanie oraz przedłużanie tymczasowego aresztowania[27].\n\nW 2001 stanął na czele Prawa i Sprawiedliwości, nowej (współtworzonej z bratem) partii, powstałej na bazie dawnego Porozumienia Centrum, jego współpracowników z NIK i MS oraz niektórych byłych członków Akcji Wyborczej Solidarność. W tym samym roku z listy PiS uzyskał mandat posła na Sejm IV kadencji w okręgu gdańskim[28].\n\nW 2001 w wywiadzie udzielonym Radiu ZET określił Mieczysława Wachowskiego mianem „wielokrotnego przestępcy”. 24 czerwca 2005 Lech Kaczyński w I instancji został uznany za winnego zniesławienia oraz skazany na grzywnę. Orzeczono wobec niego też nawiązkę na cel społeczny i zobowiązano do opublikowania przeprosin w prasie[29]. Po apelacji Lecha Kaczyńskiego Sąd Okręgowy w Warszawie wyrokiem z 14 grudnia 2005 uchylił zaskarżone orzeczenie i sprawę przekazał do ponownego rozpoznania[30]. Postępowanie karne zostało zawieszone (ze wstrzymaniem terminu przedawnienia) na mocy przepisów Konstytucji RP od 23 grudnia 2005 (w związku z objęciem urzędu prezydenta RP i przysługującego mu immunitetu), ostatecznie umorzone wobec śmierci oskarżonego.\n\nWiosną 2002 doprowadził do zjednoczenia PiS z Przymierzem Prawicy. Był prezesem PiS w latach 2001–2003 (następnie zaś, do 2006, pełnił funkcję prezesa honorowego). Po objęciu urzędu prezydenta RP wystąpił z partii (podczas drugiego kongresu PiS, który odbył się 3 czerwca 2006).\n\nOd 18 listopada 2002 do 22 grudnia 2005 zajmował stanowisko prezydenta miasta stołecznego Warszawy, wybranego w pierwszych wyborach bezpośrednich przeprowadzonych w dniach 27 października i 10 listopada 2002 z ramienia PiS. W pierwszej turze otrzymał 49,58% głosów, w drugiej zaś pokonał kandydata koalicji SLD-UP Marka Balickiego, uzyskując 70,54% głosów[31]. W trakcie kampanii wyborczej po spotkaniu z wyborcami użył wobec jednego z – zdaniem Lecha Kaczyńskiego zaczepiających go uporczywie – uczestników słów „spieprzaj, dziadu!”[32][33], które to sformułowanie było później wykorzystywane m.in. przez satyryków. Lech Kaczyński zrezygnował z funkcji na sesji rady miasta 22 grudnia 2005, w przeddzień objęcia urzędu prezydenta, lecz dopiero 8 lutego 2006, uchwałą zdominowanej przez PiS rady miasta, stwierdzono wygaśnięcie jego mandatu.\n\nPodczas jego kadencji zorganizowano obchody 60. rocznicy wybuchu powstania warszawskiego. Przy tej okazji prezydent w lipcu 2004 otworzył Muzeum Powstania Warszawskiego[34]. Za jego prezydentury powstały także wydziały obsługi mieszkańców, jak również otwarto pierwsze trasy Szybkiej Kolei Miejskiej[35] i rozstrzygnięto konkurs na projekt budynku Centrum Nauki Kopernik. W styczniu 2005 Lech Kaczyński był jednym z sygnatariuszy umowy dotyczącej finansowania budowy Muzeum Historii Żydów Polskich m.in. z funduszy miasta[36]. W okresie sprawowania urzędu stworzył stanowisko pełnomocnika ds. zwierząt[37]. W trakcie kadencji nie uruchomiono natomiast m.in. zapowiadanej budowy Mostu Północnego.\n\nW 2004 i 2005 zabronił przejścia Paradzie Równości ulicami Warszawy, co wywołało kontrowersje związane ze zgodnością tego postanowienia z Konstytucją RP oraz zarzuty o homofobię. Początkowo tłumaczył odmowę obroną publicznej moralności, później zaś brakami formalnymi. W jednym z przypadków wskazywał na zaplanowaną na ten sam dzień co parada uroczystość odsłonięcia pomnika Stefana Roweckiego, wydał natomiast zezwolenie na organizowaną przez Młodzież Wszechpolską Paradę Normalności. W 2006 Trybunał Konstytucyjny orzekł, że przepis prawa o ruchu drogowym, na który prezydent stolicy powołał się, zabraniając demonstracji, jest niezgodny z Konstytucją RP w takim zakresie, w jakim narusza on wolność do zgromadzeń[38]. W 2007 Europejski Trybunał Praw Człowieka w Strasburgu uznał, że decyzja władz miasta była sprzeczna z kilkoma postanowieniami EKPC.\n\nŚrodowisko polityczne Lecha Kaczyńskiego za jedno z osiągnięć jego prezydentury uznawało także rozbicie tzw. układu warszawskiego, istniejącej rzekomo sieci nieformalnych powiązań rządzącej miastem koalicji Platformy Obywatelskiej (wcześniej Unii Wolności) i Sojuszu Lewicy Demokratycznej z lokalnymi przedsiębiorcami, w ramach której miało dochodzić do ustawiania przetargów. Po zerwaniu koalicji z PO w radzie miejskiej wspierający prezydenta klub radnych PiS zawierał porozumienia z usuniętymi z Platformy Obywatelskiej radnymi kojarzonymi z Pawłem Piskorskim, kreowanym na lidera „układu warszawskiego”[39].\n\nW 2004 wystąpił w specjalnym odcinku teleturnieju Chwila prawdy; uzyskaną w nim wygraną goście przekazali na rzecz Fundacji TVN Nie jesteś sam[40]\n\n19 marca 2005[41] jako pierwszy ogłosił swój zamiar ubiegania się z ramienia PiS o najwyższy urząd w wyborach prezydenckich, zajmując pierwsze miejsce w sondażach. Kampania wyborcza dała mu początkowo bardzo wysokie poparcie. Wyprzedził w rankingach m.in. kardiochirurga i senatora Zbigniewa Religę. Po wystartowaniu kampanii wyborczej marszałka Sejmu Włodzimierza Cimoszewicza Lech Kaczyński spadł w lipcu na drugie miejsce w badaniach opinii publicznej. Po rezygnacji marszałka Sejmu we wrześniu nie odzyskał pozycji lidera, którą zajął w sondażach wicemarszałek Sejmu Donald Tusk, startujący z ramienia PO.\n\nJesienią jego notowania zaczęły ponownie rosnąć. Kandydat PO był przez PiS oskarżany o nadmierny liberalizm. Jego szanse zwiększyło zwycięstwo PiS w wyborach parlamentarnych. W pierwszej turze wyborów prezydenckich zajął drugie miejsce po Donaldzie Tusku, otrzymując 33% głosów. W drugiej turze głosowania Lech Kaczyński zdobył poparcie środowiska Radia Maryja, Samoobrony oraz Polskiego Stronnictwa Ludowego. W trakcie kampanii wyborczej działający w jego sztabie wyborczym (odpowiedzialny za kampanię telewizyjną) Jacek Kurski spekulował w piśmie „Angora” na temat rzekomego ochotniczego wstąpienia Józefa Tuska, dziadka Donalda Tuska, do Wehrmachtu[42].\n\nW drugiej turze głosowania w dniu 23 października 2005 Lech Kaczyński wygrał wybory, otrzymując 8 257 468 głosów, co stanowiło 54,04% głosujących[43].\n\nKadencja Lecha Kaczyńskiego na stanowisku prezydenta RP rozpoczęła się 23 grudnia 2005 i zakończyła się z chwilą jego śmierci w katastrofie lotniczej 10 kwietnia 2010. Obowiązki konstytucyjne prezydenta przejął wtedy marszałek Sejmu Bronisław Komorowski.\n\nPrezydent Lech Kaczyński podejmował w Polsce m.in. prezydenta Stanów Zjednoczonych George’a W. Busha (w czerwcu 2007), papieża Benedykta XVI (w maju 2006), prezydenta Francji Nicolasa Sarkozy’ego (w czerwcu 2007 i w maju 2008), prezydenta Pakistanu Perveza Musharrafa (w kwietniu 2007).\n\nPodtrzymał politykę zagraniczną prowadzoną przez Aleksandra Kwaśniewskiego w zakresie utrzymywania wojskowej misji stabilizacyjno-szkoleniowej na terenie Iraku. Misja ta, trwająca od 3 września 2003, na mocy postanowienia prezydenta wydanego na wniosek premiera Donalda Tuska zakończyła się 31 października 2008. 29 października 2008 do Polski powrócili żołnierze z ostatniej dziesiątej zmiany Polskiego Kontyngentu Wojskowego „Irak”[44].\n\nNa mocy postanowienia prezydenta z 2006 wydanego na wniosek premiera Jarosława Kaczyńskiego, na przełomie kwietnia i maja 2007, stacjonujący na terenie Afganistanu Polski Kontyngent Wojskowy został powiększony do prawie 1200 żołnierzy i przeszedł pod dowództwo natowskiej misji Międzynarodowych Sił Wsparcia Bezpieczeństwa (ISAF). Postanowienie to na wniosek premiera Donalda Tuska było przedłużane na kolejne okresy, w trakcie których kontyngent był stopniowo powiększany.\n\nDeklarował poparcie starań Gruzji i Ukrainy w kwestii ich akcesji do Organizacji Paktu Północnoatlantyckiego (NATO). Stanowisko to prezentował w trakcie spotkania szefów państw i rządów krajów członkowskich sojuszu, które odbyło się w Bukareszcie (59. szczyt NATO w dniach 2–4 kwietnia 2008)[45].\n\nW 2006 Lech Kaczyński miał zostać ojcem chrzestnym syna prezydenta Gruzji, jednak wyjazd do Tbilisi odwołał z powodu wypadku w Kopalni Węgla Kamiennego Halemba[46].\n\n12 sierpnia 2008 podczas wojny w Osetii Południowej poleciał do Gruzji z planowanym lądowaniem w Gandży. Pilot odmówił uwzględnienia sugestii prezydenta, aby wylądować w Tbilisi; incydent ten wywołał zainteresowanie mediów[47][48]. Ostatecznie Lech Kaczyński tego dnia (wraz z prezydentami Ukrainy Wiktorem Juszczenką, Litwy Valdasem Adamkusem, Estonii Toomasem Ilvesem i premierem Łotwy Ivarsem Godmanisem) pojawił się na wiecu politycznym w stolicy Gruzji, udzielając poparcia prezydentowi Gruzji Micheilowi Saakaszwilemu[49].\n\n23 listopada 2008 podczas pobytu Lecha Kaczyńskiego i prezydenta Gruzji przy granicy gruzińsko-osetyjskiej w pobliżu wiozącej ich kolumny nieustaleni sprawcy oddali strzały ostrzegawcze z broni palnej[50]. W sprawie tego zdarzenia śledztwo wszczęto w ramach Prokuratury Okręgowej w Warszawie[51].\n\nW ramach deklarowanych zamiarów stworzenia wspólnej polityki energetycznej łączącej kraje należące do Unii Europejskiej, Ukrainę i republiki kaukaskie, zorganizował tzw. szczyt energetyczny w Krakowie w dniach 11–12 maja 2007, w którym udział wzięli prezydenci Azerbejdżanu, Gruzji, Litwy i Ukrainy[52]. Na spotkaniu zadeklarowano porozumienie pomiędzy Polską i Litwą w sprawie tzw. mostu energetycznego i wstępnego międzyrządowego opracowania projektu budowy elektrowni atomowej dostarczającej energię na potrzeby krajów regionu[53][54].\n\nPodczas szczytu negocjacyjnego Rady Europejskiej w Brukseli w dniach 21–23 czerwca 2007, będąc w składzie delegacji rządowej, zgłaszał postulaty w sprawie systemu głosowania w RE w ramach negocjowania treści przyszłego traktatu lizbońskiego. Propozycja rządowa, dla której poparcie zadeklarowała tylko strona czeska, dotycząca tzw. systemu pierwiastkowego, wobec proponowanego przez pozostałych 25 członków szczytu tzw. zasady podwójnej większości nie uzyskała poparcia przewodniczącej Rady Europejskiej kanclerz Niemiec Angeli Merkel. W rezultacie strona polska wynegocjowała utrzymanie „systemu nicejskiego” (z 2000) do 2014[55].\n\nPrezydent był obecny w Lizbonie podczas uroczystości podpisania traktatu przez premiera Donalda Tuska i ministra spraw zagranicznych Radosława Sikorskiego. Z dniem 30 kwietnia 2008 został uprawniony do ratyfikacji traktatu lizbońskiego, który ratyfikował 10 października 2009.\n\nNa prezesa Trybunału Konstytucyjnego powołał 4 listopada 2006 Jerzego Stępnia, a 25 czerwca 2008 Bohdana Zdziennickiego. W ramach swoich uprawnień 31 stycznia 2006 powołał do Krajowej Rady Radiofonii i Telewizji Elżbietę Kruk i Wojciecha Dziomdziorę, a po ich rezygnacji z zajmowanych funkcji nominował Piotra Boronia (18 września 2007) i Barbarę Bubulę (26 września 2007). 6 stycznia 2006 na swojego przedstawiciela w Krajowej Radzie Sądownictwa wyznaczył Ewę Stryczyńską. W styczniu 2007 wskazał kandydata na prezesa Narodowego Banku Polskiego w osobie Sławomira Skrzypka.\n\nPostanowieniem z 3 stycznia 2008[58] jako pierwszy prezydent w III Rzeczypospolitej odmówił nominacji na stanowiska sędziowskie dziewięciu kandydatom przedstawionym mu do powołania przez Krajową Radę Sądownictwa. Powołał się na art. 179 Konstytucji RP (posługującym się wyłącznie terminem „powołuje”). Pierwszy Prezes Sądu Najwyższego Lech Gardocki wystąpił o rozstrzygnięcie sporu kompetencyjnego, jednak Trybunał Konstytucyjny umorzył postępowanie z wniosku wobec braku przesłanek sporu kompetencyjnego[59].\n\nPostanowieniem z 5 marca 2010 powołał na urząd prokuratora generalnego Andrzeja Seremeta, a na jego wniosek 31 marca 2010 trzech zastępców.\n• 23 lutego 2006 – poświęcone programowi prac rządu w 2006 i zasadom współpracy między rządem a prezydentem;\n• 9 czerwca 2006 – poświęcone sytuacji w służbie zdrowia, problemowi bezrobocia, koordynacji działań w polityce zagranicznej i rządowej, propozycji zmian w sposobie opodatkowania twórców;\n\nPodczas trwającego sporu politycznego w Sejmie prezydent w orędziu telewizyjnym z 13 lutego 2006 zapowiedział, że nie skorzysta z prerogatywy skrócenia kadencji wobec uznania przez niego, że Sejm V kadencji nie uchwalił ustawy budżetowej w terminie konstytucyjnym[60].\n\nNa skutek uchwały Sejmu z 7 września 2007 o skróceniu kadencji Sejmu V kadencji, postanowieniem z 8 września 2007 zarządził na dzień 21 października tego roku przedterminowe wybory parlamentarne[61].\n\nW 2008 prezydent przesłał do Senatu projekt postanowienia w sprawie przeprowadzenia w dniach 10–11 stycznia 2009 referendum ogólnokrajowego w kwestii komercjalizacji i prywatyzacji służby zdrowia. Senat uchwałą z 29 października 2008 nie wyraził zgody na referendum[62].\n\n22 maja 2009 zwrócił się z orędziem do Sejmu VI kadencji na temat kryzysu finansowego i stanu polskiej gospodarki[63].\n• Wybrane prezydenckie inicjatywy ustawodawcze:\n• 2006 – projekt ustawy zmieniającej Konstytucję RP w zakresie dotyczącym ekstradycji i europejskiego nakazu aresztowania; ustawa została przyjęta, zmieniając Konstytucję RP w dniu 7 listopada 2006;\n• 2007 – projekt ustawy zmieniającej Konstytucję RP w zakresie dotyczącym ochrony życia poczętego człowieka; ustawa w głosowaniu z 13 kwietnia 2007 nie została przyjęta przez Sejm kwalifikowaną większością głosów.\n• Ratyfikacje wybranych umów międzynarodowych:\n• w grudniu 2006 ratyfikował konwencję między RP a Wielką Brytanią w sprawie unikania podwójnego opodatkowania;\n• w marcu 2007 ratyfikował umowę międzynarodową o przystąpieniu RP do konwencji rzymskiej;\n• Wybrane weta prezydenckie:\n• w sierpniu 2006 zawetował ustawę zmieniającą kodeks cywilny w zakresie zrzeczenia się prawa własności nieruchomości;\n• w maju 2008 zawetował ustawę o zmianie ustawy o radiofonii i telewizji;\n• w listopadzie 2008 zawetował nowelizację ustawy o ochronie gruntów rolnych i leśnych oraz trzy ustawy z pakietu reformy służby zdrowia;\n• w grudniu 2008 zawetował ustawę o Krajowej Szkole Sądownictwa i Prokuratury.\n\nNajwyższe polskie odznaczenie, Order Orła Białego, otrzymali od niego hierarchowie Kościoła katolickiego (Andrzej Maria Deskur, Ignacy Tokarczuk, Kazimierz Majdański, Henryk Gulbinowicz, Józef Glemp), działacze opozycji antykomunistycznej w PRL: Jan Józef Lipski (pośmiertnie), Andrzej Gwiazda i Anna Walentynowicz, były rzecznik interesu publicznego Bogusław Nizieński, kardiochirurg i polityk Zbigniew Religa, były premier Jan Olszewski, pośmiertnie: aktor Gustaw Holoubek, pierwszy marszałek senatu III RP Andrzej Stelmachowski oraz bohaterowie okresu II wojny światowej i okupacji hitlerowskiej, skazani na karę śmierci lub represjonowani w okresie stalinowskim (generał Emil Fieldorf, rotmistrz Witold Pilecki, Łukasz Ciepliński, Franciszek Niepokólczycki, Wincenty Kwieciński). Order Orła Białego otrzymał również m.in. król Arabii Saudyjskiej Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Aziz Al Su’ud. Pośmiertnie prezydent przyznał go również Ronaldowi Reaganowi. Lech Kaczyński przekazał nadane pośmiertnie w drugiej połowie lat 90. Ordery Orła Białego rodzinom Kazimierza Pużaka i Zbigniewa Herberta[64][65].\n\nW 2006 pozbawił Helenę Wolińską-Brus Krzyża Komandorskiego Orderu Odrodzenia Polski (nadanego uchwałą Rady Państwa z 1954) oraz Krzyża Kawalerskiego Orderu Odrodzenia Polski (nadanego uchwałą Krajowej Rady Narodowej z 1945). W tym samym roku odznaczył Krzyżem Zesłańców Sybiru generała Wojciecha Jaruzelskiego. Po ujawnieniu tego faktu przez TVN minister Andrzej Urbański z Kancelarii Prezydenta RP oświadczył, że został on odznaczony przez pomyłkę, gdyż „prezydent akceptował tylko postanowienia, nie zaś listy osób” i nie zdawał sobie sprawy, że na liście występuje Wojciech Jaruzelski[66]. Po tym oświadczeniu Wojciech Jaruzelski odesłał otrzymane odznaczenie.\n\nPod koniec 2005, wkrótce po swoim wyborze, odnosząc się do Orderu Orła Białego, krytycznie ocenił nominacje dokonywane przez Aleksandra Kwaśniewskiego, co skutkowało ustąpieniem z funkcji kanclerza kapituły przez Barbarę Skargę[67]. Wiosną 2007 uznał, iż wobec niezłożenia oświadczeń lustracyjnych wymaganych ustawą wygasło członkostwo w kapitule Tadeusza Mazowieckiego i Bronisława Geremka, wkrótce z członkostwa zrezygnował Władysław Bartoszewski. Do kapituły w trakcie swojej kadencji powołał Andrzeja Gwiazdę, Wiesława Chrzanowskiego, Ignacego Tokarczuka oraz Bogusława Nizieńskiego.\n\nW 2007 awansował pośmiertnie na stopnie generalskie i admiralskie 88 żołnierzy oraz 2 duchownych zamordowanych w 1940 w Katyniu i Charkowie w ramach zbrodni katyńskiej[68].\n\nLech Kaczyński ułaskawił 202 osoby[69], w 2006 odmówił prawa łaski 550 osobom. Wbrew wcześniejszym zapowiedziom (związanym z krytyką działań Aleksandra Kwaśniewskiego) zrezygnował z publikacji listy osób ułaskawionych[70]. W 2009 ułaskawił m.in. trzech braci skazanych za zabójstwo w ramach tzw. linczu we Włodowie, warunkowo zawieszając wykonanie orzeczonych wobec nich kar pozbawienia wolności[71]. W tym samym roku w tzw. trybie szczególnym (wybieranym decyzją prezydenta i pomijającym zasięganie opinii sądów orzekających w danej sprawie) i przy negatywnej opinii prokuratora generalnego poprzez skrócenie o połowę okresu próby i zarządzenie zatarcia skazania ułaskawił przedsiębiorcę z Kwidzyna, skazanego za oszustwa i przestępstwa przeciwko dokumentom. Według doniesień medialnych w swoim procesie karnym skazany był broniony przez adwokata Marka Dubienieckiego, zaś kilka tygodni przed decyzją o ułaskawieniu założył z jego synem, Marcinem Dubienieckim (będącym jednocześnie zięciem Lecha Kaczyńskiego), pierwszą z kilku wspólnych spółek[72].\n\nPostanowieniem z 16 lutego 2007 opublikował w Monitorze Polskim tekst raportu autorstwa likwidatora WSI Antoniego Macierewicza w sprawie działalności służb wojskowych w Polsce[73]. W związku z zapadłym w tej sprawie wyrokiem Trybunału Konstytucyjnego zdecydował natomiast nie ujawniać treści aneksu do raportu przedłożonego mu w listopadzie 2007[74].\n\nW 2007 z jego inicjatywy po raz pierwszy po II wojnie światowej w dniu Święta Wojska Polskiego (15 sierpnia) została zorganizowana w Warszawie defilada wojskowa[75][76]. W 68. rocznicę agresji ZSRR na Polskę z 1939 Lech Kaczyński 17 września 2007 wraz z delegacją wziął udział w uroczystościach w Katyniu i Smoleńsku upamiętniających zbrodnię katyńską[77].\n\nZ inicjatyw Lecha Kaczyńskiego zostały ustanowione ustawą Narodowy Dzień Pamięci Powstania Warszawskiego w 2009 i Narodowy Dzień Pamięci „Żołnierzy Wyklętych” w 2011. Był pierwszym urzędującym prezydentem Polski, który po II wojnie światowej odwiedził synagogę[78].\n\n10 kwietnia 2010 Lech Kaczyński wyleciał z Warszawy rządowym samolotem Tupolew Tu-154M nr 101, by udać się na obchody 70. rocznicy zbrodni katyńskiej. Zginął wraz z żoną i wszystkimi członkami delegacji w katastrofie lotniczej w Smoleńsku w pobliżu lotniska Smoleńsk-Siewiernyj[79]. Jego ciało zostało odnalezione 10 kwietnia 2010, a wieczorem tegoż dnia zidentyfikował je Jarosław Kaczyński[80]. Z chwilą śmierci prezydenta jego konstytucyjne obowiązki zaczął tymczasowo wykonywać marszałek Sejmu Bronisław Komorowski, który zarządził żałobę narodową, trwającą w Polsce w dniach 10–18 kwietnia 2010[81][82].\n\nPo przeprowadzeniu sekcji zwłok 11 kwietnia trumnę z ciałem Lecha Kaczyńskiego przewieziono samolotem CASA ze Smoleńska do Warszawy[83]. 13 kwietnia, po przetransportowaniu z Rosji do Polski trumny z ciałem małżonki prezydenta[84], obie wystawiono na widok publiczny w Sali Kolumnowej Pałacu Prezydenckiego[85]. Według szacunków urzędników Kancelarii Prezydenta RP od 13 do 17 kwietnia przed trumnami przeszło około 180 tys. ludzi[86]. Następnie trumny przewieziono do bazyliki archikatedralnej św. Jana Chrzciciela w Warszawie[87].\n\n18 kwietnia trumny z ciałami Lecha Kaczyńskiego i Marii Kaczyńskiej przewieziono drogą powietrzną do Krakowa. Para prezydencka została pochowana z honorami wojskowymi[88] w krypcie pod Wieżą Srebrnych Dzwonów bazyliki archikatedralnej św. Stanisława i św. Wacława na Wawelu[89]. W 2010 z inicjatywy Jarosława Kaczyńskiego w kwaterze 92. cmentarza Powązkowskiego w Warszawie powstał cenotaf Lecha Kaczyńskiego i jego żony Marii[90].\n\nSzczątki pary prezydenckiej zostały ekshumowane 15 listopada 2016 w ramach zaplanowanych przez prokuratorów ekshumacji ofiar katastrofy smoleńskiej, a następnie przebadane w Zakładzie Medycyny Sądowej Collegium Medicum Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego[91]. Ponowny pochówek w tym samym miejscu miał miejsce trzy dni później z udziałem prezydenta Andrzeja Dudy i premier Beaty Szydło. Trumny pary prezydenckiej zostały umieszczone w nowym sarkofagu wykonanym z marmuru karraryjskiego[92].\n\nZ tytułu objęcia urzędu prezydenta RP Lech Kaczyński został kawalerem Orderu Orła Białego, Wielkim Mistrzem Orderu i przewodniczącym jego Kapituły, a także kawalerem Orderu Odrodzenia Polski I klasy, Wielkim Mistrzem Orderu i przewodniczącym jego Kapituły[93].\n• Tytuł „Człowieka Roku 2006”, przyznany przez Federację Regionalnych Związków Gmin i Powiatów RP\n• Nagroda „Europejskiego Męża Stanu 2006”, przyznana przez tureckie środowiska dziennikarskie i gospodarcze za wspieranie procesu integracji Turcji z Unią Europejską\n• Krzyż Honorowego Harcerza Rzeczypospolitej w związku z objęciem honorowego protektoratu nad organizacjami harcerskimi (2008),\n\nOdebrał doktoraty honoris causa gruzińskiego Państwowego Uniwersytetu im. Iwane Dżawachiszwilego (2007), Narodowej Akademii Administracji Państwowej przy prezydencie Ukrainy (2007), Państwowego Uniwersytetu Mongolskiego (2008), Uniwersytetu Studiów Zagranicznych Hankuk w Seulu (2008), Uniwersytetu Słowiańskiego w Baku (2009)[116], Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego Jana Pawła II (2009)[117].\n\nRównież w 2010 pośmiertnie został odznaczony Medalem „Zasłużony dla Wymiaru Sprawiedliwości – Bene Merentibus Iustitiae”[119], Krzyżem Honorowym „Ad Amicum” Związku Harcerstwa Rzeczypospolitej[120] oraz Odznaką honorową „Zasłużony dla Województwa Podkarpackiego”[121], a w 2011 Krzyżem Semper Fidelis przyznawanym przez Związek Solidarności Polskich Kombatantów[122].\n\nW 2017 pośmiertnie wyróżniono go nagrodą Kustosz Pamięci Narodowej przyznawaną przez Instytut Pamięci Narodowej[123].\n\nLechowi Kaczyńskiemu pośmiertnie przyznano tytuły honorowego obywatela: w 2010 Bogatyni[124], Warszawy[125], Leszna[126], Dolnego Śląska[127], Turku[128], Lubina[129], Tarnobrzega[130], Wadowic[131], Skórcza[132], w 2011 Radomia[133], a w 2013 Jastrzębia-Zdroju[134].\n\nUchwałami rad miejskich imieniem Lecha Kaczyńskiego nazwano m.in. w 2010 park w Sopocie[135], ulicę w Kielcach, największe (według stanu na datę nadania) rondo w Sieradzu[136], skwer w Świdnicy[137], park w Gdyni[138], skwer w Ostrołęce[139], rondo w Pułtusku[140], Salę Balkonową ratusza w Głogowie[141], rondo w Zgierzu[142], rondo w Rumi[143], w 2011 plac w Lublinie[144], park w Zakopanem[145], rondo w Starachowicach[146], w 2012 ulicę w Siedlcach[147], w 2020 rondo w Tarnowie[148], w 2021 ulicę w Dąbrowie Tarnowskiej[149]. Imieniem Marii i Lecha Kaczyńskich nazwano bulwar we Wrocławiu (2013)[150] oraz skwer w Poznaniu (2021)[151].\n\nPoza granicami Polski imieniem zmarłego prezydenta nazwano w 2010 na Ukrainie część ulicy Polskiej w Odessie[152] (jednocześnie umieszczono tablicę pamiątkową[153]) oraz ulicę w Mukaczewie[154]. W tymże roku w Gruzji imię Lecha i Marii Kaczyńskich otrzymały ulice w Tbilisi[155] i w Batumi[156], a także szpital rejonie Libreville w Gabonie[157]. Również w 2010 imię Lecha Kaczyńskiego otrzymała ulica w Kiszyniowie w Mołdawii[158], ulica w Chicago w Stanach Zjednoczonych[159] oraz skwer w Tbilisi w Gruzji (gdzie umieszczono pomnik w postaci popiersia)[160]. W 2016 jego imię otrzymała ulica w Żytomierzu na Ukrainie[161]. Natomiast w 2017 imię byłego prezydenta otrzymały ulice w Elmwood Park[162] oraz we Franklin Park w Stanach Zjednoczonych[163].\n\nW 2010 szkole podstawowej w Chełchach pod Ełkiem (jako pierwszej w Polsce) nadane zostało imię Lecha Kaczyńskiego[164]. W 2011 szkole podstawowej w miejscowości Podsarnie w województwie małopolskim nadano imię Lecha i Marii Kaczyńskich[165]. W 2016 terminal LNG w Świnoujściu oraz Krajowa Szkoła Administracji Publicznej otrzymały imię prezydenta RP Lecha Kaczyńskiego[166][167].

Poland supports Ukraine in its struggle against Russia and is calling for very tough sanctions on Moscow for its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest report once again drums up hostility toward Russia among some Poles, chiefly supporters of the nationalist government, it what seems to be an effort to consolidate the voter base of the Law and Justice party, which was founded by the Kaczynski twins in 2001.\n\nSuspicions are additionally fuelled by Russia’s refusal to return the wreckage, which has complicated Poland’s investigation.\n\nEarlier, two separate reports by Polish and Russian experts on aviation incidents said the crash on approach in dense fog to the Smolensk airport, which did not have sophisticated aviation equipment, was the result of human errors made in adverse weather conditions.\n\nThey found no proof of foul play."}

The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, a shared arena with the NHL's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the most successful team in NBA history and hold the records for most NBA championships won, with 18, and most recorded wins of any NBA franchise.[11][12]\n\nThe Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell became the team's player-coach, as well as the first African American head coach in any United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team experienced a renewed rivalry with the \"Showtime\" Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones against the Lakers. After the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s.\n\nAfter another period of rebuilding, the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" around team captain Paul Pierce by acquiring Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in the 2007 offseason. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team defeated the Lakers to win their 17th championship in 2008, while also losing to the Lakers in the 2010 Finals. Allen, Garnett, and Pierce were no longer with the team by the start of the 2013–14 season, with Garnett and Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for four total future first round picks. With two of these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Led by \"The Jays\", the team returned to the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Golden State Warriors, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 2024 to secure their 18th championship.\n\nThe \"Celtics\" nickname and the team's mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are nods to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century.[13] The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who are second in NBA history with 17 championships. The teams' rivalry was especially pronounced in the 1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP awards.[14]\n\nThe Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4–1. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League.[15][16] In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.[17] Chuck Connors of The Rifleman fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.[18]\n\nThe Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach.[19] In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy\".[20] Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags,[21] but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft.\n\nAfter the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft.[22] After negotiating with the Rochester Royals—a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell.[23] Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn.[24] Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.[24] With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title.[25] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[26]\n\nFollowing the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[27] In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships.[28] During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.[29] The Celtics of the late 1950s–1960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.[30]\n\nAuerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.[31] With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time.[32] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[33] The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history,[34] with Russell's 11 titles being the most won by an NBA player.\n\nThe 1969–70 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens[35] and Jo Jo White,[36] the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed.[37] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship.[38] Boston took a 3–2 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years.\n\nIn 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[39] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[40] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[41]\n\nThe Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[42] Auerbach took a risk by selecting junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird's rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In 1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr.[43] Two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the Braves for \"Tiny\" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes.[44] The move turned Boston fans against Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team's future and because Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.[44]\n\nThe relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February 1979,[45] in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise.[46] Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach.[47] Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result.[46] With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager.[48][49] The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53.[50] Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.[51]\n\nLarry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season.[52] With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo,[53] a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft.[49] He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors[54] the team went 61–21, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[55]\n\nAfter the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately, Auerbach sent the team's two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish[56] and the Warriors' first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale.[57] The \"Big Three\" of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together,[58] and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.[59][60][61][62]\n\nDespite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81.[63] Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3–1 before coming back to win Game Seven, 91–90. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over the Houston Rockets,[64] with Maxwell being named NBA Finals MVP.[65]\n\nFollowing the 1981–82 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games.[66] In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the Milwaukee Bucks;[67] afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.[68]\n\nIn 1983–84, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62–20 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.[69] Boston came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship.[70] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president.[71] He was succeeded by Jan Volk.[71]\n\nIn 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers winning.[72] This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell.[73] Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\n\nThe Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era.[74] Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose.[75] Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship.[76] They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six games.\n\nIn 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[77] Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston's hopes for 1988–89 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989–90 and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics player Chris Ford.\n\nUnder Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51–31 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992.\n\nThe loss of Bird and the aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode.[78] Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game series loss by the Charlotte Hornets.[79] An examination revealed heart problems,[80] but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season.[81] The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35.[82] With McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte.[56] The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark.\n\nIn 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994–95 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Rađa, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record.\n\nThings got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997.[83][84] Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve.\n\nThe Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft,[85] and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Rađa and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[86] and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[87][88] Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year,[89] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.[90]\n\nThe following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce,[91] a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals.[92] However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable \"walking through that door\" speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish, which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory.[93] He resigned in January 2001.[94]\n\nFollowing the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12–21 when Pitino left, O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24–24.[95] Following the 2000–01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics.\n\nThe Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3–2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4–1. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4–2.[96]\n\n2003–2007: new ownership and arrival of Doc Rivers\n\nIn 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C.,[97] led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.[98] Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk).[99] In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch,[100] and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.[101]\n\nThe Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004–05 season,[102] having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak.\n\nThe Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added center Leon Powe.[103] The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946.[104] The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle.[105] The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak.[106] At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis.[107] The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett.[108] These moves created a new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett.\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006–07 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.[109]\n\nFor the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108–102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.[110] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.[111]\n\nThe 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the then-best starting record in NBA history.[112] They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak.[113] After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.[114]\n\nIn 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record.[115] Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play.[116] For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six,[117] and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games.\n\nDuring the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins' departure: the Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury[118] and had a 19–3 record in games when O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[119] Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and led the Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed.[118][120] The 2010–11 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal, limited to 12 minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.[121]\n\nThe Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0–3, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in the league after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row. The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions.\n\nThe 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins.[122] The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3–0 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to four.[123]\n\nDuring the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn.[124] The deal marked the start of a youth movement for the team.[125]\n\nOn July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach.[126] Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013–14 season marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the \"Big Three\".[127]\n\nThe next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft,[128] and signed Evan Turner. The 2014–15 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks.[129] A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics,[130] leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture,[131] and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining.[132] However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40–42 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.[133] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.\n\nIn the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015–16 NBA season with a 48–34 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4–2 to the Hawks, ending their season.\n\nIn the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8, 2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al Horford.[134] The Celtics finished the 2016–17 season with a 53–29 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference.[135] After a hip injury ended Thomas' playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals,[136] the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his second straight All-Star game and first All-NBA selection, finishing third in the league in scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick.[b] They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks.[137] The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon Hayward.[138] On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.[139]\n\nBy the end of the off-season, only four Celtics' players remained from the 2016–17 team,[140] with Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg,[141] causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season.[142] Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history.[143] The Celtics finished the year with a 55–27 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals.\n\nThe Celtics finished the 2018–19 season with a 49–33 record. Analysts started questioning the team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10–10 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018.[144] The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18–10.[145] During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128–95, the New York Knicks 128–100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133–77), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team.[146] The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs.[147] In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.[148] [149]\n\nThe Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the 14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year).[150] During the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston.[151] On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick.[152] On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.[153]\n\nFollowing the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[154] In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games.[155] Boston struggled with injuries in the 2020–21 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119–100. In the playoffs, they lost to the Brooklyn Nets in five games.[156]\n\n2021-22: first Finals appearance for the Jays\n\nOn June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[157] On June 18, Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[158] On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics.[159][160] Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland.\n\nIn April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, having a 51–31 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the postseason.[161] They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2–1 series lead, but lost the next three games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4–2.[162]\n\nIn September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022–23 season for engaging in an improper intimate relationship with a female staffer.[163] Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the interim head coach.[164] On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team's permanent head coach after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42–17 record at the NBA All-Star break.[165] After overcoming a 3–2 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell behind 3–0 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3–0 comeback in NBA history with a decisive win in Boston.\n\nDuring the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porziņģis from the Wizards. In the trade, they sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal,[166] and also traded Grant Williams to the Dallas Mavericks.[167] On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks.[168] On February 7, 2024, before the trade deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.[169]\n\nThe Celtics finished the 2023–24 regular season with the best record in the NBA, securing a 64–18 record.[170] After the regular season's close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[171][172][173] The Celtics' victory in the Eastern Conference Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry Bird trophy, the first of his career.[174][175] The Celtics would go on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie with the Lakers (who have 17).[176]\n\nThe rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.[177] The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010.\n\nThe Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four.\n\nThe rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history.\n\nThe Celtics–Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949–50 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.[178] While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.\n\nThe Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics[179] who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\"[180] in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[181] The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.[182]\n\nThe rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990. Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.[183]\n\nThe rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.[184]\n\nThe Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15.[185] The 76ers are considered the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.[186]\n\nOne of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984,[187] the rivalry intensified during the 2015–16 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016–17 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117–108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"[188]\n\nIn their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123–108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123–111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats.[189] In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4.[190] No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017.\n\nThe Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams were highlighted by their star trios in Boston's Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3–2 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Miami taking a commanding a 3–0 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games. However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3–0 lead. They then met in the 2024 first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games.\n\nList of the last five seasons completed by the Celtics. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Boston Celtics seasons.\n\nThe Celtics have won an NBA-record 18 championships.[191] Forty-eight members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame are connected to the Celtics,[192] and the franchise has retired 23 jersey numbers, more than any other American sports team.[193] As of December 2023, the Celtics have won more NBA regular season games than any other team.[194]\n\n37 people were inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as players, 6 – as coaches, 6 – as contributors.[195]\n\nAdditionally, Johnny Most and Mike Gorman were honored with the Hall of Fame's Curt Gowdy Media Award. Most was awarded in 1993 for his 37-year career as the Celtics radio announcer, while Gorman was awarded in 2021 for his 40-year career as the Celtics television announcer.\n• 1 In total, Heinsohn was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice – as player and as coach.\n• 2 In total, Bird was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice – as player and as a member of the 1992 Olympic team.\n• 3 In total, Russell was inducted into the Hall of Fame twice – as player and as coach.\n• 4 Sanders also coached the team in 1978.\n\nFIBA, the body which governs international basketball, has selected two players associated with the Celtics to the FIBA Hall of Fame for contributions to international basketball.\n\nThe Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[196] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams.\n\nBold denotes still active with the team.\n\nItalic denotes still active but not with the team.\n\nPoints scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217]\n\nOther statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217]\n\nThere have been 18 head coaches in Celtics' history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise's head coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics' legend Bill Russell took coaching duties from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.[218]\n\nThe Boston Celtics logo features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky, originally depicted with a large basketball for a background. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach.[219] Through the 1995–96 season, the logo's only colors were green, white and black.[220] Then for the 1996–97 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.[221]\n\nThe Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters \"Celtics\" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.[5][222]\n\nFor much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.[223]\n\nAmong the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the team name (1965–2014).[224]\n\nWhen Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.[4]\n\nIn January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year[225] to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms.[226][227] Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics' uniforms.\n\nIn November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey sponsor of the team.[228] In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team's jersey sponsor.[7]\n\nFrom 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.[229]\n\nA gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed \"Parquet Pride\", the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.[230]\n\nFor 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black \"Statement\" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league's third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with \"Celtics\" in green lettering and white trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same. Starting in 2020, the \"Statement\" uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.[231]\n\nBetween 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick's Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front.[232] For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates.[233] In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping.\n\nDuring the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack.\n\nAt the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team.\n\nThe Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008–09 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012–13 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016–17 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping.\n\nStarting with the 2017–18 season, the Celtics wore special edition \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. Their first \"City\" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.[234]\n\nFor the 2018–19 season, the Celtics wore white \"City\" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline.[235][236] In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the \"City\" uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired by the team's warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold trim.[237]\n\nThe Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a green base and a stylized \"Boston\" wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.[238]\n\nThe 2020–21 Celtics' \"City\" uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach's signature and quote \"The Boston Celtics are not a basketball team. They're a way of life.\" appears above the manufacturer's tag.[239] The Celtics also released a second \"Earned\" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white trim.[240]\n\nThe Celtics' green \"City\" uniform for the 2021–22 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the franchise's initial uniforms; the left side contained the team's 75th anniversary emblem, while the right side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006–07 season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much of its history, and the original \"jumping leprechaun\" logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 \"City\" uniform), and 17 shamrocks representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.[241]\n\nThe 2022–23 \"City\" uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the \"Celtics\" wordmark inspired by the Slade's Bar & Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each side, commemorating each of Russell's championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell's jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.[242]\n\nThe \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker's marks from Boston's history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets first used in the game.[243] In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the \"City\" uniform, featured a mostly green-painted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the \"BOSTON\" wordmark.[244]\n\nFor the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform, the Celtics built upon last season's \"City\" uniform and focused on continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured \"Action green\" (neon green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers. [245]\n\nDuring the 2006–07 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname \"Red\" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.[246]\n\nThe team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964–65), Bob Schmertz (1975–76), Joan Cohen (1989–90), Johnny Most (1992–93), Reggie Lewis (1993–94), Dorothy Auerbach (2000–01), Dennis Johnson (2006–07),[246] Jim Loscutoff (2015–16), Jo Jo White (2017–18), John Havlicek (2018–19), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020–21), Sam Jones (2021–22), and Bill Walton (2023–24). During the 2019–20 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 (later replaced with a dedicated memorial patch), and the death of Isaiah Thomas' younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs.[247]\n\nIn the 2022–23 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory of Bill Russell.[248]\n\nThe team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s, the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.[249]\n\nPrior to the 2003–04 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008–09 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents.[250] Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers.\n\nThe Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011–12 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams.\n\nNBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England. Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast's current ownership of NBCUniversal.\n\nAs of the 2024–25 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian Scalabrine as an analyst.\n\nAll Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group's WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise branded as \"The Sports Hub\"), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013–14 season.[251] It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network.\n\nLong-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team's radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024.\n• Reebok Pro Summer League, a former summer league operated by the Celtics\n• Taylor, John. *The Rivalry: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, and the Golden Age of Basketball.* New York: Random House, 2006.\n• Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame - Boston Celtics' Legacy - Profiles of legendary Celtics players such as Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, and Larry Bird from the official Hall of Fame website.\n• NBA’s Official Celtics History Page - Overview of the Celtics’ achievements, notable players, and championships.\n• Basketball-Reference: Boston Celtics Franchise Index - Comprehensive data on the Celtics’ season records, player statistics, and more.\n• Russell, Bill. *Red and Me: My Coach, My Lifelong Friend.* New York: HarperCollins, 2009."}

It is usually manufactured as a powder from corn gluten meal. Zein is one of the best understood plant proteins.[1] Pure zein is clear, odorless, tasteless, hard, water-insoluble, and edible, and it has a variety of industrial and food uses.[2][3]\n\nHistorically, zein has been used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric,[4] buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \"Vicara\".[2][5] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.[6][7] It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability.[8]\n\nZein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \"confectioner's glaze\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products[9] or as \"vegetable protein.\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs.[citation needed]\n\nZein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.[10][11] With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.[12][13] Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications.[citation needed]\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.[14] They are also studying medical applications such as using the zein molecule to \"carry biocompounds to targeted sites in the human body\".[15] There are a number of potential food safety applications that may be possible for zein-based packaging according to several researchers. A military contractor is researching the use of zein to protect MRE food packages.[16] Other packaging/food safety applications that have been researched include frozen foods,[17] ready-to-eat chicken,[18] and cheese and liquid eggs.[19] Food researchers in Japan have noted the ability of the zein molecule to act as a water barrier.[20]\n\nWhile there are numerous existing and potential uses for zein, the main barrier to greater commercial success has been its historic high cost until recently. Zein pricing is now very competitive with food shellac. Zein may be extracted as a byproduct in the manufacturing process for ethanol[21] or in new off-shore manufacture.[citation needed]\n\nAlpha-prolamins are the major seed storage proteins of species of the grass tribe Andropogoneae. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication.[22] In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes;[23] twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.[24]ZO® Skin Health | Medical Skin Care: The season of gifting brings about so many questions of what to get for your loved ones.

Additionally, he investigates systemic hereditary diseases that can affect the eye such as Usher syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, Joubert syndrome, WAGR syndrome, and albinism. Dr. Zein's research focuses on the natural history and the pathobiology of these diseases in the hopes of gaining a greater understanding of these conditions. He also concentrates on the psychophysical and electrophysiological studies of ocular function.

Butler, Dr. David Fleck, Acaté’s Field Coordinator, talks about his history of living with the Matsés people in the deep Amazon rainforest. Fleck shares his perspective of life in the Amazon, its threats, and Acaté’s work. Originally posted here.\n\nTribes in the Amazon are increasingly exposed to the outside world by choice or circumstance. The fallout of outside contact has rarely been anything less than catastrophic, resulting in untold extinction of hundreds of tribes over the centuries. For ones that survived the devastation of introduced disease and conquest, the process of acculturation transformed once proud cultures into fragmented remnants, their self-sufficiency and social cohesion stripped away, left to struggle in a new world marked by poverty and external dependence.\n\nIn the deepest recesses of the Amazon, remaining tribes struggle to retain their cultural identity and self-sufficiency in a profoundly-shifting world. Such is the case with the Matsés – or Jaguar People – that live along the Javari river and its tributaries in Peru and Brazil. A tribe of fierce warriors permanently contacted only in 1969, the Matsés are perhaps best-known for their facial tattoos, ceremonial practices, and use of toxins from giant tree frogs as a stimulant for hunting expeditions.\n\nWhile most Matsés continue to live fairly traditionally, depending on wild game and fish as their primary food source, many increasingly rely on goods from non-indigenous villages and towns, creating need for Matsés to find sources of money to participate in the cash economy. Discrimination and outside influences have led many young Matsés to lose interest in, feel ashamed by, and even outright resent their culture. As with many other indigenous peoples worldwide, the Matsés struggle against resource and land grabs by petroleum, logging, and mining interests.\n\nFew outsiders understand the challenges facing the Matsés better than David Fleck, a linguist who has worked with the tribe for the better part of two decades. Dr. Fleck in fact lives in one of the most remote Matsés villages, farming a small jungle garden and living a traditional lifestyle. He is married to a Matsés woman and has two sons. Fleck has written a grammar of their language, co-authored the definitive book of their culture (which he translated into their own language), and has published over 30 scientific articles on Matsés language, culture, and ethnobiology.\n\nToday Fleck, working with Acaté Amazon Conservation, an NGO operating in Peru, is developing programs to generate sustainable livelihoods for communities that enable Matsés to meet their basic needs, meanwhile protecting the traditional knowledge base upon which the tribe depends to maintain their self-sufficiency and minimize external dependence. Acaté Amazon Conservation, named after the indigenous term for the giant monkey tree frog used ceremonially by the Matsés, was co-founded in 2012 by physician-ethnobotanist Christopher Herndon, M.D. and sustainable agriculturalist William Park.\n\nFleck talked about the Matsés and his work with Acaté during a January interview with Mongabay.com.\n\nMongabay.com: What is your background and what first drew you to Matsés territory?\n\nDavid Fleck: Before becoming a linguist, I was a zoology student at the Ohio State University in the early 1990’s. As part of an undergraduate honor’s thesis project, I carried out a trap-and-release study of the several local opossum species in a primary rainforest plot along the Ucayali River in Amazonian Peru.\n\nThere was a poorly-maintained footpath off a road from a town near my field research site to a Peruvian military outpost at the Peru-Brazil border called Colonia Angamos. When I had finished my field collection, I learned that the town baker was planning to take the over week-long trek along the footpath to Angamos. Having a few weeks before I needed to return to the States, and a desire to put into use my minor in Portuguese, I asked if I could tag along. Rather than taking me directly to Angamos on the Javari River, the baker took a side route, whereby we emerged from the forest at a Matsés village on the Gálvez River.\n\nI didn’t even know at the time that there were Indians in the area. At that village, the chief received my very hospitably, asked about my research and invited me to continue my zoological work with them. I was so delighted with the Matsés and their village that I accepted. In 1994, I began a Master’s research project that inventoried mammalian diversity in the region as well as examined Matsés knowledge of local mammals and classification of rainforest habitats.\n\nMongabay.com: What was the area like back in the early 1990’s (e.g. access, deforestation, outside influence, etc)? How has it changed since then?\n\nDavid Fleck: In the early 1990’s, the government had not yet began to build cement tin-roofed schoolhouses and there was only one motorized canoe in each village. Only a few men could communicate in Spanish and they had not yet begun to work timber in Matsés territory. Back then the Matsés were not interested in money, because they had little access to shops, so I compensated my hosts and helpers only with trade items like machetes, axes, fishhooks, tin pots, etc.\n\nToday, the Matsés continue to be very traditional in several respects: they still procure almost all of their food from hunting, fishing, farming, and collection of wild food. They still speak Matsés as their primary means of communication, they continue to rely heavily on traditional medicinal knowledge, and the older Matsés retain most of their traditional knowledge and beliefs. However, now that there are many motorized canoes and the Matsés travel frequently to Colonia Angamos and the city of Iquitos. They have a lot more contact with non-tribal Peruvians. The younger Matsés are losing interest in their culture and are not learning their traditional knowledge.\n\nMongabay.com: What has been the evolution of your work in the region? (e.g. going from biology to linguistics)\n\nDavid Fleck: After having spent a total of 20 months in San Juan doing my master’s field research, I knew that I wanted to continue spending long periods of time with the Matsés. I told my advisor that I wanted to do another ethnobiology project among the Matsés for my Ph.D. dissertation. My advisor responded that it would be nearly impossible to find a job if I did so. Biology departments were not interested in hiring professors specialized in ethnobiology and anthropology departments were not interested in hiring professors with a degree in zoology. He suggested that if I wanted to continue working with the Matsés that I should switch to anthropology or linguistics. Since I had enjoyed learning to speak Matsés, I chose linguistics. In 1997, I received a scholarship to study linguistics at Rice University in Houston, and spent another two years doing research at San Juan to write a grammar of the Matsés language as my Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nWhen I graduated in 2003, I was hired as a postdoctoral research fellow at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia and spent another couple years doing research on the Matsés language at San Juan. After having written a series of academic articles on the Matsés language and a Matsés-Spanish dictionary, I was offered a permanent faculty position at La Trobe University. However, this job would not allow me to conduct more than about two months of field research per year. I reflected on the fact that the only reason why I had gotten into linguistics was because I wanted to be among the Matsés, and so decided to quit my job and start a family among the Matsés.\n\nMongabay.com: You are married to a Matsés woman. Has that changed how you are viewed in the community?\n\nDavid Fleck: When I was a researcher, I made many good friends among the Matsés. An old woman once felt sorry for me because I did not have a family, so she adopted me and called me “son.”’ Some of her sons and other close relatives subsequently also called me by kinship terms. However, these kinship relations were not considered real. Once I was married, however, ALL the Matsés became my kin. Through their relation with my wife Dina, all the Matsés can determine a kin relation to me. So this definitely changed my status among the Matsés, considering that the term “Matsés” also means “kinsman” and that kin relations are the most important thing in their culture. Though obviously I am not a real Matsés, one could say that now I am officially an honorary Matsés, with the corresponding privileges and obligations. Now I have two sons, who are considered to be true Matsés.\n\nMongabay.com: What is your current lifestyle? (e.g. Do you spend most of your time in the forest? How do you make a living?)\n\nDavid Fleck: When I first got married and began to live permanently among the Matsés in 2008, I spent most of my time hunting, fishing, farming, collecting wild foods, and working on my house, like most Matsés. I did that for two years until my savings ran out. As it turned out, my in-laws looked to me to purchase things like salt, soap, ammunition, flashlight batteries, machetes etc., which they now require but have few opportunities to acquire money to purchase. So despite my preference for traditional subsistence activities, I have taken on several occupations that allow me to earn some money to contribute to my extended family’s necessities. As they told me, “the best way to contribute is to do what one does best,” and in the end, I am only a mediocre hunter. Among these activities is a project, funded by the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Documentation Programme, documenting the oral history of the Matsés. I am also working for the Peruvian ministry of education writing pedagogical materials for the Matsés bilingual education program. In the end, I still have time to do my farm work, but I don’t get to go hunting as often as I would like.\n\nMongabay.com: How many Matsés are there and where is there territory?\n\nDavid Fleck: Today, the Matsés number approximately 3300 and live along the Javari river and its tributaries in the remote region that divides Amazonian Peru and Brazil. About two-thirds live in Peru within the department of Loreto, and the remainder third live within the Brazilian state of Amazonas. In Brazil, the Matsés are known better as Mayoruna, a term that was also used to designate the Matsés in Peru until the 1980s.\n\nMongabay.com: What is the state of the Matsés today?\n\nDavid Fleck: The Matsés established peaceful contact with the Brazilian and Peruvian national cultures in 1969, so they are still relatively traditional: most still practice traditional subsistence strategies; all still speak their language; and much of their traditional beliefs remain intact. But this is rapidly changing as younger generation loses interest and pride in their culture.\n\nMongabay.com: Does the tribe operate as a single political unit or are there large variances within the group, like some villages that less traditional than others?\n\nDavid Fleck: Although the Peruvian and Brazilian Matsés are politically completely separate, they visit each other, intermarry, and generally consider themselves to all belong to the same tribe. There is a tendency for the more remotely-located villages to be more traditional, but overall, there is not a wide difference among the different villages.\n\nMongabay.com: Are there any voluntarily isolated or “uncontacted” Matsés?\n\nDavid Fleck: There are uncontacted groups in Brazil near Matsés territory, but their identity is unknown. It is possible that some speak languages similar to that of the Matsés, but the Matsés say that all their kin are accounted for among the contacted Matsés.\n\nMongabay.com: Are there practices that set the Matsés apart from other indigenous groups in the region?\n\nDavid Fleck: Because Matsés were contacted so recently and live in such a remote and inaccessible area, they are much more traditional than other ethnic groups in the area (other than the uncontacted groups). Their culture is similar to the traditional culture of other related tribes of the Panoan-linguistic family in the region. They are known for their facial tattoos, their elaborately-crafted arrows, and their use of frog poison as emetic. Before peaceful contact, the Matsés were notorious for raiding other Indians and non-Indians at the periphery of their territory and capturing the women to take as wives.\n\nMongabay.com: How is the Matsés way of life changing? Are there threats to their traditional ways of life?\n\nDavid Fleck: One factor that threatens the Matsés is discrimination. Many Peruvians, especially the ones who live near Matsés territory are racist and speak negatively of the Matsés and their culture. Consequently, many young people have come to feel ashamed of their culture and try to hide their identity as Matsés when they are outside of their communities. For the most part, the younger generation has little interest in Matsés traditional knowledge. However, the older generation still retains a deep pride in their culture.\n\nWith this in mind, I am involved in two projects. One is the writing of a book in the Matsés language about their oral history, which relates the heroic deeds of their ancestors, with the hope of instilling pride in the younger generation. The second project is writing, in conjunction with Acaté and Matsés elders, is a book in their language that documents the Matsés’ traditional medicinal plant knowledge. The book is a first step in an initiative that that will sponsor an apprenticeship program where Matsés medicine men will train young apprentices in traditional healing.\n\nMongabay.com: Are younger Matsés leaving villages to pursue opportunities elsewhere?\n\nDavid Fleck: Every year more young Matsés men are leaving the Matsés village to work or join the army. Some do not come back. However, most young people are still living among the Matsés.\n\nMongabay.com: Is Matsés territory being affected by deforestation, energy extraction, illegal logging and mining, or industrial agriculture? Does the government of Peru recognize the Matsés land rights?\n\nDavid Fleck: A Canadian petroleum company is trying to enter Matsés territory to drill for oil, despite the fact that the Matsés have stated clearly that they do not want oil extraction on their land. The Peruvian government has granted the Matsés title to about half of their ancestral territory in Peru, and made the other half into a national park. However, the government retains mineral rights in Matsés territory, and they have granted the Canadian company access to Matsés territory.\n\nMongabay.com: What is Acaté’s approach to conservation?\n\nDavid Fleck: Acaté believes empowering indigenous peoples is the most effective and enduring approach for rainforest conservation. Tribal peoples understand and value the rainforest because they depend on it. This relationship extends beyond a utilitarian reliance—there is a spiritual link to the forest, an interconnectivity of all its inhabitants. It is not a coincidence that the remaining tracts of pristine rainforest in the Neotropics overlap with areas of indigenous inhabitation.\n\nDavid Fleck: The Acaté team and the Matsés leadership have worked closely together to develop a three-point plan of action that is welcomed by the Matsés communities and is being implemented in a logical, sequential manner.\n\nFirst, we are developing programs that provide long-term, sustainable revenue to the communities, enabling them to buy the simple items they need for their homes. Conservation is not about telling peoples what activities they shouldn’t engage in but rather in developing tangible economic alternatives where few or none exist. To this end, Acaté assists the Matsés in the sustainable harvesting and marketing of natural products such as renewable tree resins copaiba and sangre de grado. By harvesting valuable tree resins, they can immediately earn the income they need and be free of destructive and dangerous timber-cutting jobs.\n\nSecondly, we are supporting indigenous systems of health such as medicinal plant knowledge before they are irrevocably lost. This will maintain their self-sufficiency and alleviate long-term dependency on the limited external medical resources available in their remote villages. Loss of shamanic knowledge can be counteracted with inauguration of an internship program for the youth to learn the wisdom of their elders as well as through development of an encyclopedia of their medicinal plant knowledge. This resource is being produced in the Matsés language for repository within their communities. It will not be translated into Spanish or English to protect their knowledge against bioprospecting by outside parties.\n\nThirdly, we have developed an innovative farm in my village of Estirón to pilot and share approaches that promote nutritional diversity, enhance soil fertility, and abundance. Small-scale agriculture is responsible for large levels of Amazonian deforestation, but is one of the least addressed issues in conservation today. These agricultural techniques seek to modify the slash-and-burn farming practices that no longer work for larger and increasingly permanent settlements.\n\nMongabay.com: How can people in the United States help further Acaté’s work?\n\nDavid Fleck: The Matsés were contacted in the past half-century and live in some of most pristine rainforests in the world. What makes our projects so high impact is that their forests and culture have remained intact until recently, providing all of us a rare opportunity in the 21st century to be proactive.\n\nBut the world of the Matsés is changing. Predatory oil companies are pressing to exploit the large reservoirs of natural gas in Matsés’ territory, the extraction of which—if recent history is any precedent—will poison their waters and sicken their children. The lure of the city is pulling younger Matsés away from their homes into a reality of poverty and exploitation. Matsés who do remain need cash to secure basic material goods which forces them into to the only economic opportunities locally available: hunting bushmeat and/or logging. Both practices threaten to deplete their already-strained forests.\n\nIt is easy to undervalue just how much impact people outside in the United States and abroad can have. It is humbling that an investment of comparatively few resources can change so much the trajectory of a proud people struggling for their cultural survival amidst a profoundly shifting world. Acaté strives to be a vehicle of positive change in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. We operate with the highest level of transparency and with minimal operating overhead. If you are passionate about the rainforest and want to make a difference in the lives of its indigenous protectors, please take a moment to learn more about our work.

Referred to as the \"Queen of Tejano Music\", her contributions to music and fashion made her one of the most celebrated Mexican-American entertainers of the late 20th century. In 2020, Billboard magazine put her in third place on their list of \"Greatest Latino Artists of All Time\", based on both Latin albums and Latin songs chart.[2] Media outlets called her the \"Tejano Madonna\" for her clothing choices.[a] She also ranks among the most influential Latin artists of all time and is credited for catapulting the Tejano genre into the mainstream market.[7][8]\n\nThe youngest child of the Quintanilla family, she debuted in the music scene as a member of the band Selena y Los Dinos, which also included her elder siblings A.B. Quintanilla and Suzette Quintanilla. In the 1980s, she was often criticized and was refused bookings at venues across Texas for performing Tejano music—a male-dominated music genre. However, her popularity grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987, which she won nine consecutive times. She signed with EMI Latin in 1989 and released her self-titled debut album the same year, while her brother became her principal music producer and songwriter.\n\nSelena released Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), which peaked at number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months. The album's commercial success led music critics to call it the \"breakthrough\" recording of her musical career. One of its singles, \"Como la Flor\", became one of her most popular signature songs. Live! (1993) won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. In 1994, she released Amor Prohibido, which became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. It was critically acclaimed as being responsible for Tejano music's first marketable era as it became one of the most popular Latin music subgenres at the time.\n\nSelena was shot and killed on March 31, 1995, by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and the former manager of her Selena Etc. boutiques. Saldívar was cornered by police when she attempted to flee and threatened to kill herself but was convinced to give herself up. She was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison with possible parole after 30 years. Two weeks later, George W. Bush, then-governor of Texas, declared April 16 as Selena Day in Texas. Her posthumous crossover album, Dreaming of You (1995), debuted atop the Billboard 200, making Selena the first Latin artist to accomplish this feat. In 1997, Warner Bros. released Selena, a film about her life and career, which starred a then-unknown Jennifer Lopez as Selena, catapulting Lopez into fame. In 2020, Netflix released Selena: The Series starring Christian Serratos. Selena has sold around 18 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling female artists in Latin music.[9]\n\nSelena Quintanilla was born on April 16, 1971, at Freeport Community Hospital in Freeport, Texas.[10][11] She was the youngest child of Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora), who was Mexican-American with some Cherokee ancestry, and Abraham Quintanilla Jr., a Mexican American former musician.[13] The obstetrician-gynecologist at her birth was future House of Representatives member Ron Paul.[10] Selena was raised as a Jehovah's Witness.[14] Quintanilla Jr. noticed her musical abilities when she was six years old. He told People magazine, \"Her timing, her pitch were perfect, I could see it from day one\". In 1980, Quintanilla Jr. opened his first Tex-Mex restaurant in Lake Jackson, Papa Gayo's, where Selena and her siblings Abraham III (on bass guitar) and Suzette Quintanilla (on drums) would often perform.[15] The following year, the restaurant was forced to close after a recession caused by the 1980s oil glut. The family declared bankruptcy and were evicted from their home.[15][16] They settled in Corpus Christi, Texas; Quintanilla Jr. became manager of the newly formed band Selena y Los Dinos and began promoting it.[4][15][17] They needed the money and played on street corners, weddings, quinceañeras, and fairs.[15]\n\nAs her popularity as a singer grew, the demands of Selena's performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father took her out of school when she was in the eighth grade.[19] Her teacher Marilyn Greer disapproved of Selena's musical career. She threatened to report Quintanilla Jr. to the Texas Board of Education, believing the conditions to which Selena was exposed were inappropriate for a girl her age. Quintanilla Jr. told Greer to \"mind her business\". Other teachers expressed their concerns when they noticed how tired Selena appeared when she arrived at school. At seventeen, Selena earned a high school diploma from the American School of Correspondence in Chicago and was also accepted at Louisiana State University. She enrolled at Pacific Western University, taking up business administration as her major subject.[23]\n\nQuintanilla Jr. refurbished an old bus; he named it \"Big Bertha\" and the family used it as their tour bus. In the first years of touring, the family sang for food and barely had enough money to pay for gasoline. In 1984, Selena recorded her first LP record, Selena y Los Dinos, for Freddie Records.[25] Despite wanting to record English-language songs, Selena recorded Tejano music compositions; a male-dominated, Spanish-language genre with German influences of polka, jazz, and country music, popularized by Mexicans living in the United States.\n\nQuintanilla Jr. believed that Selena should record musical compositions related to her heritage.[29] During the recording sessions for the album, Selena had to learn Spanish phonetically with guidance from her father. In 1985, to promote the album, Selena appeared on the Johnny Canales Show, a popular Spanish-language radio program, on which she continued to appear for several years. Selena was discovered by musician Rudy Trevino, founder of the Tejano Music Awards, where she won the Female Vocalist of the Year award in 1987 and for nine consecutive years after.[31]\n\nThe band was often turned down by Texas music venues because of the members' ages and because Selena was their lead singer. Her father was often told by promoters that Selena would never be successful because she was a woman in a genre historically dominated by men. By 1988, Selena had released five more LP records; Alpha (1986), Muñequito de Trapo (1987), And the Winner Is... (1987), Preciosa (1988), and Dulce Amor (1988).\n\nJosé Behar of newly formed label EMI Latin Records, together with the new head of Sony Music Latin, watched Selena perform at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. Behar was searching for new Latin acts and wanted to sign Selena to EMI's label Capitol Records, while Sony Music Latin offered Quintanilla Jr. twice Capitol's signing fee.[35] Behar thought he had discovered the \"next Gloria Estefan\" but his superior called Behar illogical because he had been in South Texas less than a week.[19][36] Quintanilla Jr. chose EMI Latin's offer because of the potential for a crossover album and wanted his children to be the first musicians to sign to the label.[37]\n\nBefore Selena began recording for her debut album, Behar and Stephen Finfer requested a crossover album for her.[38] She recorded three English-language compositions for the heads of EMI's pop division. Behar and Finfer's request for a crossover album was denied and Selena was told she needed a bigger fan base to sell such an album.[39] Behar thought EMI Records and the public did not believe that a Mexican American woman could have \"crossover potential\" after Charles Koppelman denied the project.[36]\n\nSelena released her self-titled debut album on October 17, 1989. The singer recorded most of the songs at AMEN Studios in San Antonio, Texas; \"Sukiyaki\" and \"My Love\" were recorded at Sunrise Studios in Houston. Selena wrote \"My Love\" and wanted the song to be included on the album. Her brother A.B., became Selena's principal record producer and songwriter for most of her musical career, though did not write the tracks \"Sukiyaki\", \"Contigo Quiero Estar\", and \"No Te Vayas\". \"Sukiyaki\" was originally recorded in Japanese in the 1960s by Kyu Sakamoto; Selena used a translation into Spanish of an English version of the song by Janice Marie Johnson.[41] Selena peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart,[42] becoming Selena's first recording to debut on a national music chart. The album performed better than other recordings from other contemporaneous female Tejano singers.\n\nIn the same year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena to become one of their spokespeople in Texas.[23] The jingle used in her first two commercials for the company was composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for them both to distance themselves, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant and shortly afterward became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla Jr. would try to break it up.\n\nSelena released her second studio album, Ven Conmigo, in September 1990. Three tracks from Ven Conmigo were released as singles; \"Ya Ves\", \"La Tracalera\", and \"Baila Esta Cumbia\".[51] The latter, a Tejano cumbia song, became one of Selena's most successful singles. Its popularity grew in Mexico, where a compilation album bearing the single's name was released there, which was certified platinum by the Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON), denoting sales of 150,000 units.[52][53]\n\nA registered nurse and fan named Yolanda Saldívar asked Quintanilla Jr. to start a fan club in San Antonio. Saldívar had the idea after she had attended one of Selena's concerts. Quintanilla Jr. approved Saldívar's request; he believed the fan club would bring more exposure for the band. Saldívar soon became a close friend to Selena and the family; she was trusted and became the acting president of the fan club in 1991.[55] That same year, Salvadoran singer Álvaro Torres composed a duet he wanted to record with Selena. The song, \"Buenos Amigos\", was produced by Enrique Elizondo and was released on Torres' tenth studio album Nada Se Compara Contigo (1991).[56]\n\n\"Buenos Amigos\" peaked at number one on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart, giving Selena her first number-one single. The song's music video earned Selena and Torres two nominations at the 1992 Billboard Music Awards.[57] The track was also nominated for Duo of the Year at the 1992 Tejano Music Awards.[58] Biographer Deborah Parédez wrote that the track enabled Selena to tour the west and east coasts of the United States. According to John Lannert of Billboard magazine, \"Buenos Amigos\" was helped by increased airplay on regional Mexican and Tejano radio stations, which had previously dismissed Selena's recordings.[60]\n\nSelena's sister Suzette claimed to have caught Selena and Pérez flirting with each other and immediately informed their father.[b] Quintanilla Jr. took Pérez off the bus and told him his relationship with Selena was over. Selena and Pérez continued their relationship despite Quintanilla Jr's disapproval;[64] Selena's mother Marcella approved of their relationship. Quintanilla Jr. saw Selena and Pérez romantically together on the bus after he informed them of his disapproval; he pulled over and an argument between him and Selena ensued. He called Pérez a \"cancer in my family\" and threatened to disband the group if they continued their relationship.[66]\n\nSelena and Pérez relented; Quintanilla Jr. fired Pérez from the band and prevented Selena from leaving with him. After his dismissal, Pérez and Selena secretly continued their relationship. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena and Pérez decided to elope, believing Quintanilla Jr. would never approve of their relationship.[69] Selena thought her father would have to accept them if they were married and would not have to hide their feelings for each other. Within hours of their marriage, the media announced the couple's elopement.\n\nSelena's family tried to find her; Quintanilla Jr. did not take the news well and alienated himself for some time. Selena and Pérez moved into an apartment in Corpus Christi. In interviews, Quintanilla Jr. expressed how he feared Pérez could be a machista (Spanish for a male chauvinist), who would force Selena to end her career and music goals, a move that prevented Quintanilla Jr. to accept Pérez as being suitable for Selena at the time.[72] Quintanilla Jr. later approached Pérez, apologized, accepted the marriage, and took Pérez back into the band.\n\nA month after her elopement, Selena released her third studio album, Entre a Mi Mundo, in May 1992. The album was critically acclaimed as her \"breakthrough album\".[74][75][76] The recording peaked at number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart for eight consecutive months;[77] it was certified 10× platinum by the RIAA for sales of 600,000 album-equivalent units,[78] while in Mexico, the album sold 385,000 units. Entre a Mi Mundo became the first Tejano album by a female artist to sell over 300,000 copies.[c]\n\nSelena was booked for a high-profile border press tour in Monterrey, Mexico, with music media figures in a meet-and-greet conference. At the time, Tejanos were looked down on as \"hayseed pochos\" among Mexican citizens. The singer's Spanish was far from fluent; EMI Latin executives were \"terrified\" about the singer's limited Spanish during the press conference for the album in Mexico.[82] According to Patoski, Selena \"played her cards right\" during the conference and won over the Mexican media after newspapers hailed her as \"an artist of the people\". The newspapers found her to be a refreshing change from Mexican telenovela actors \"who were fair-skinned, blond-haired, and green-eyed.\"\n\nAfter her publicity press, Selena was booked to play at several concerts throughout Mexico, including a performance at Festival Acapulco in May 1993, which garnered her critical acclaim. Her performance in Nuevo León on September 17, 1993, was attended by 70,000 people, garnering her the title of the biggest Tejano act in Mexico. The album produced four singles; \"Como la Flor\", \"¿Qué Creías?\", \"La Carcacha\", and \"Amame\". \"Como la Flor\" became Selena's signature recording; it was critically acclaimed by music critics as a career launcher for Selena.[86]\n\n\"Como la Flor\" helped Selena to dominate the Latin music charts and become immensely popular in Mexico—where Mexican-Americans were generally not liked among citizens—which was well received by critics. The track was nominated for Song of the Year at the 1993 Tejano Music Awards.[88] The single peaked at number six on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart.[89] In 1994, Entre a Mi Mundo ranked as the second best-selling regional Mexican album of all-time.\n\nSelena released Live! a year after Entre a Mi Mundo; it was recorded during a free concert at the Memorial Coliseum in Corpus Christi, on February 7, 1993. The album included previously released tracks that were sung live and three studio recordings; \"No Debes Jugar\", \"La Llamada\", and \"Tú Robaste Mi Corazón\"—a duet with Tejano musician Emilio Navaira. The tracks \"No Debes Jugar\" and \"La Llamada\" peaked within the top five on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart.[92] Live! won the Grammy Award for Best Mexican/American Album at the 36th Grammy Awards.\n\nIn May 1994, Live! was named Album of the Year by the Billboard Latin Music Awards.[93] At the 1994 Tejano Music Awards, Live! won Album of the Year,[94] while at the 1994 Lo Nuestro Awards, it was nominated for Regional Mexican Album of the Year.[95] Live! was certified gold by the RIAA for shipments of 500,000 copies, while in Mexico it sold 250,000 units.[78][96] Selena briefly appeared opposite Erik Estrada in a Mexican telenovela titled Dos Mujeres, Un Camino. In 1995 she entered negotiations to star in another telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa. She appeared in two episodes, which garnered record ratings for the series.\n\nAside from music, in 1994 Selena began designing and manufacturing a line of clothing; she opened two boutiques called Selena Etc., one in Corpus Christi and the other in San Antonio. Both were equipped with in-house beauty salons. By the end of 1994, Selena Etc. had held two fashion shows to showcase their clothing line. Selena (alongside her band, Selena y Los Dinos) held a concert after Selena Etc.'s second fashion show on December 3, 1994, at the Hemisfair Arena in San Antonio. She was in negotiations to open more stores in Monterrey, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Saldívar managed both boutiques after the Quintanilla family were impressed with the way she managed the fan club.\n\nHispanic Business magazine reported that the singer earned over five million dollars from these boutiques.[100] She was ranked among the twentieth-wealthiest Hispanic musicians who grossed the highest income in 1993 and 1994. Selena released her fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido, in March 1994. The recording debuted at number three on the US Billboard Top Latin Albums chart[102] and number one on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums charts.[103] After peaking at number one on the Top Latin Albums, the album remained in the top five for the rest of the year and into early 1995.[104]\n\nAmor Prohibido became the second Tejano album to reach year-end sales of 500,000 copies, which had previously only been accomplished by La Mafia.[106] It became one of the best-selling Latin albums in the United States. Amor Prohibido spawned four number-one singles; the title track, \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\", \"No Me Queda Más\", and \"Fotos y Recuerdos\".[d] Amor Prohibido was among the best selling U.S. albums of 1995,[111] and has been certified 36× platinum by the RIAA for sales of 2.16 million album-equivalent units in the United States.[78] The album was named on Tom Moon's list of the 1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die: A Listener's Life List (2008).\n\nAmor Prohibido popularized Tejano music among a younger and wider audience than at any other time in the genre's history.[114] The two singles, \"Amor Prohibido\" and \"No Me Queda Más\", were the most successful US Latin singles of 1994 and 1995, respectively.[115][116] The album's commercial success led to a Grammy nomination for Best Mexican/American Album at the 37th Grammy Awards in 1995.[117] It won Record of the Year at the 1995 Tejano Music Awards[94] and Regional/Mexican Album of the Year at the 1995 Lo Nuestro Awards. Selena was named \"one of Latin music's most successful touring acts\" during her Amor Prohibido tour.[118]\n\nAfter Amor Prohibido's release, Selena was considered \"bigger than Tejano itself\", and broke barriers in the Latin music world.[119] She was called the \"Queen of Tejano Music\" by many media outlets.[e] Billboard magazine ranked Amor Prohibido among the most essential Latin recordings of the past 50 years[126] and included it on its list of the top 100 albums of all-time. In 2017, NPR ranked Amor Prohibido at number 19 on their list of the 150 greatest albums made by women.[128] Sales of the album and its titular single represented Tejano music's first commercial success in Puerto Rico.[119] Selena recorded a duet titled \"Donde Quiera Que Estés\" with the Barrio Boyzz, which was released on their album of the same name in 1994. The song reached number one on the Top Latin Songs chart,[129] which enabled Selena to tour in New York City, Argentina, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central America, where she was not well known.\n\nIn late 1994, EMI chairman Charles Koppelman decided Selena had achieved her goals in the Spanish-speaking market. He wanted to promote her as an English-language solo pop artist. Selena continued touring while EMI began preparing the crossover album, engaging Grammy Award-winning composers. By the time Selena performed to a record-breaking, sold-out concert at the Houston Astrodome in February 1995, work had already begun on her crossover album. In 1995, she made a cameo appearance in Don Juan DeMarco, which starred Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp, and Faye Dunaway.[133]\n\nThe Quintanilla family appointed Yolanda Saldívar as manager of Selena's boutiques in early 1994.[55] Eight months later, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio, Texas. After the agreement, Saldívar moved from San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena. In December 1994, the boutiques began to suffer after the number of staff for both stores had decreased. According to staff members, Saldívar often dismissed employees she disliked. Employees at the stores regularly complained about Saldívar's behavior to Selena, who dismissed the claims, believing Saldívar would not negatively impose erratic decisions on Selena's fashion venture.\n\nAccording to Quintanilla Jr., the staff later turned their attention to him and began informing him about Saldívar's behavior. Quintanilla Jr. took the claims seriously; he told Selena to \"be careful\" and said Saldívar might not be a good influence. Selena dismissed her father's inquiries because he had often distrusted people in the past. By January 1995, Selena's fashion designer Martin Gomez, her cousin Debra Ramirez, and clients had expressed their concerns over Saldívar's behavior and management skills. During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from The Dallas Morning News said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession.\n\nAccording to Quintanilla Jr., in January 1995, he began receiving telephone calls from fans who said they had paid for membership in the Selena fan club and had received nothing in return for it, and he began an investigation. Quintanilla Jr. discovered that Saldívar had embezzled more than $30,000 via forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques.[138] Quintanilla Jr. held a meeting with Selena and Suzette on the night of March 9 at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar. Quintanilla Jr. presented Saldívar with the inconsistencies about the disappeared funds. Quintanilla Jr. told her that if she did not provide evidence that disproved his accusations, he would involve the local police. Quintanilla Jr. banned Saldívar from having any contact with Selena. However, Selena did not want to dissolve their friendship; she thought Saldívar was essential to the success of the clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep her close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax preparation.\n\nIn the days before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank statements and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico.[19] Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey.[f] During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this did not include a gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico.[139]\n\nAfterward, Selena again met with Saldívar in her motel room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi.[4] At the motel, Selena demanded the financial papers. At 11:48 a.m. (CST), Saldívar got a gun from her purse[140] and pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing the subclavian artery and causing a severe loss of blood. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a 392-foot (119 m) trail of blood.[141] She collapsed on the floor as the clerk called the emergency services, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a \"bitch\".[142] Before collapsing, Selena named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot.[143] Meanwhile, Saldívar attempted to leave in her pickup truck. She was spotted by a responding police cruiser.[141] She surrendered after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police and the FBI.[4] By that time hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene. Many wept as police took Saldívar away.[4][141]\n\nSelena was taken to the Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at 12:00 p.m. (CST). Her pupils were fixed and dilated, there was no evidence of neurological function, she had no vital signs, and was declared clinically brain dead.[145] Dr. Louis Elkins, cardiac surgeon, arrived at Memorial Hospital and said he saw doctors making \"heroic efforts\" to revive Selena.[145] They were able to establish an \"erratic heartbeat\" long enough to transfer her to the trauma room,[146] and began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena's chest and finding massive internal bleeding.[141] By the time Elkins arrived, an emergency doctor began \"massaging her heart\" after it had stopped beating.[147] Elkins reported how all efforts were futile and said had he been the receiving doctor, he would not have made any treatments on Selena. He felt \"obligated to continue\" after the emergency room doctor made the decision to reanimate the singer.[148] After 50 minutes of surgery, she was pronounced dead from blood loss and cardiac arrest at 1:05 p.m. (CST).[141][149]\n\nAn autopsy was performed on the same day due to the overwhelming media response.[150] It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest.[141] Her official cause of death was described as \"exsanguinating internal and external hemorrhage due to perforating gunshot wound\" resulting in \"massive bleeding\".[151] The internal examination revealed that she had not ingested any type of drug, nor was she pregnant,[152] which was a rumor that began spreading after her death.[153]\n\nOn April 1, Bayfront Plaza in Corpus Christi held a vigil which drew 3,000 fans.[155] During the event, it was announced that a public viewing of the casket would be held at the Bayfront Auditorium the following day. Fans lined up for almost one mile (1.6 km). An hour before the doors opened, rumors that the casket was empty began circulating, which prompted the Quintanilla family to have an open-casket viewing.[157] About 30,000 to 40,000 fans passed by Selena's casket.[157][158][159] More than 78,000 signed a book of condolence. Flowers for the casket viewing were imported from The Netherlands. At the request of Selena's family, video and flash photography was banned.[161]\n\nOn April 3, 1995, six hundred guests—mostly family members—attended Selena's burial at Seaside Memorial Park in Corpus Christi, Texas,[162] which was broadcast live by a Corpus Christi and San Antonio radio station without the consent of her family. A Jehovah's Witness minister from Lake Jackson preached in English, quoting Paul the Apostle's words in 1 Corinthians 15. Hundreds of people began circling the area in their vehicles. Among the celebrities who attended Selena's funeral were Roberto Pulido, Bobby Pulido, David Lee Garza, Navaira, Laura Canales, Elsa Garcia, La Mafia, Ram Herrera, Imagen Latina, and Pete Astudillo.[164] A special mass held the same day at Los Angeles Sports Arena drew a crowd of 4,000.[165]\n\nSelena's murder had a widespread impact. Reactions to her death were compared to those following the deaths of musicians John Lennon and Elvis Presley and that of U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Major television networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news—Tom Brokaw referred to Selena as \"The Mexican Madonna\".[167] Her death was front-page news in The New York Times for two days. Many vigils and memorials were held in her honor, and radio stations in Texas played her music non-stop.[169] Her funeral drew 60,000 mourners, many of whom traveled from outside the United States.[169]\n\nThe news struck the Hispanic community extremely hard. Many fans traveled thousands of miles to see Selena's house and boutiques, and the crime scene.[171] By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour because a line of cars began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' houses. Among the celebrities who contacted the Quintanilla family to express their condolences were Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Julio Iglesias, and Madonna. Other celebrities—including Stefani Montiel, Jaime DeAnda (of Los Chamacos), and Shelly Lares—appeared on radio stations to express their thoughts about Selena's death.\n\nAn issue of People magazine was released several days after her murder. Its publishers believed interest would soon wane. They released a commemorative issue within a week when it became clear it was growing. The issue sold nearly a million copies,[175] selling the entire first and second print runs within two weeks. It became a collector's item, a first in the history of People. Betty Cortina, an editor of People, told Biography they never had an issue that was completely sold out; \"it was unheard of\". In the following months, the company released People en Español aimed at the Hispanic market, due to the success of the Selena issue.[176] This was followed by Newsweek en Espanol and Latina magazine.[177]\n\nA few days later, Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder and burial, poked fun at her mourners, and criticized her music. Stern said, \"This music does absolutely nothing for me. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul ... Spanish people have the worst taste in music. They have no depth.\" Stern's comments outraged and infuriated the Hispanic community in Texas. Stern's sound effects man added gunshots to her music played in the background on his show.[179] A South Texas judge issued a disorderly conduct arrest warrant in his name. \"I did it for all the Tejano fans,\" Justice of the Peace Eloy Cano said. Free-speech advocates said the warrant was unconstitutional. \"It fails the First Amendment test,\" said Jay Jacobson, executive director for the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It's a speech that is protected being a music critic, no matter how harsh, is not grounds for criminal charges.\"[180] Stern made an on-air statement, in Spanish, saying his comments were not made to cause \"more anguish to her family, friends and those who loved her\".[181][182] The League of United Latin American Citizens boycotted Stern's show, finding his apology unacceptable.[183]\n\nTexas retailers removed any products that were related to Stern, while Sears and McDonald's sent a letter stating their disapproval of Stern's comments to the media because some fans believed the companies sponsored Stern's show. Within a week, on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Stern and Robin Quivers (his co-host) were asked whether Stern's remarks about Selena were acceptable. Quivers decided not to talk about the situation to avoid arguing with Stern. When Linda Ronstadt—a pop singer of Mexican-American heritage—appeared on the show, she and Quivers argued when Ronstadt defended Selena.\n\nOn April 12, 1995, two weeks after Selena's death, George W. Bush, governor of Texas at the time, declared her birthday, April 16, Selena Day in the state.[23][186] He said Selena represented \"the essence of south Texas culture.\" Some European Americans in Texas wrote to the editor of the Brazosport Facts during April and May, asking what the big deal was; some were offended that Selena Day fell on Easter. Others said, \"Easter is more important than Selena Day\", and that they believed people should let Selena rest in peace and continue with their lives. Mexican Americans in Texas wrote vociferously to the newspaper. Some said others were too critical of Selena Day, and should not have responded so rudely.\n\nIn October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar of first-degree murder and she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years in 2025. Life with the possibility of parole was the maximum prison term allowed in Texas that could be imposed at the time.[191] In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay.[192][193] Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been in a museum.[23]\n\nSelena possessed a soprano vocal range.[194] During her lifetime, she expressed her love and admiration for Gloria Estefan, who she credited with opening the door for female artists of hispanic descent.[195] Selena's other major influences include Madonna, Paula Abdul,[196] Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, as well as rock bands such as AC/DC and Kiss.[197]\n\nIn an April 1995 interview with Billboard magazine, Behar said he saw Selena as a \"cross between Janet Jackson and Whitney Houston in style, feel, and vocal range\".[198] Although Selena did not write most of her songs, she incorporated R&B, Latin pop, technopop, country and western, and disco into her Tejano music repertoire. Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News said that during her music career, Selena \"merges Tejano's infectious cumbia rhythm with street-savvy R&B, old-school soul, dancehall reggae, sizzling salsa, and trippy, loopy funk\". Selena's recordings expressed \"love and pain, as well as strength and passion\", according to Charles Tatum.\n\nShe also recorded independently driven, female-empowerment-themed compositions; \"Si La Quieres\", \"¿Qué Creías?\", \"Ya Ves\" and \"Ya No\", which centered around inappropriate relationships and recovery from domestic violence. Peter Watrous of The New York Times said Selena's voice \"sometimes quivered\", and that she \"roughed it up a bit\". He continued, \"[a]t its best, it had a coolness, a type of unadorned passion\".[205] Ilan Stavans called her music \"cursi-melodramatic, cheesy, overemotional, not too far from Juan Gabriel and a relative of Iglesias\".[206] Richard Corliss of Time magazine said her songs \"are perky, cheerful rather than soulful\", and that earlier recordings, \"with their tinny, Tijuana Brass charts, and keyboards that evoke calliopes are ideal for the fairground or merry-go-round\". Corliss calls Selena's singing an \"expert mimicry of everything from Édith Piaf's melodramatic contralto to the coloratura riffs of Mariah Carey. But the sounds are still lightly Hispanic.\"[207]\n\nNewsweek magazine called Selena's English-language recordings \"a blend of urban pop and Latin warmth\".[208] According to Texas Monthly, Selena's brother modernized her music into a more \"funk and hip hop\" sound.[209] Selena's use of emotive range during her musical career has been praised by critics as being her trademark.[210] A.B. wrote increasingly cumbia-influenced songs for Ven Conmigo (1990); Ramiro Burr of Billboard said Selena and her band had \"evolved a rhythmic style that demonstrated its increasing prowess for catchy cumbias such as 'Baila Esta Cumbia' and the title track\". Italian essayist Gaetano Prampolini wrote that \"Selena's voice projected a sonorous warmth and joyfulness\" during his review of Selena's cumbia recordings. In his review of the remix album Enamorada de Ti (2012), Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that Selena's songs were \"rooted in the '90s and sound that way\".[214]\n\nQuintanilla Jr. sought to maintain Selena's image clean and family-oriented. In 1989, she was offered sponsorship from beer companies but her father turned them down.[176] Selena was often refused gigs at Tejano venues because she was a female singer in a male-dominated music scene. Manuel Peña wrote that after 1989, Selena's popularity increased and she became a sex icon following the release of her debut album. Charles Tatum said Selena drew most attention from her \"beauty, sexuality, and youthful impact on the Tejano music scene\".\n\nSelena said she never wanted to record explicit songs because of her upbringing and because her fan base consisted largely of young children, who regarded her as a role model. She further commented on the question of her sexual appeal to men during her crossover attempt, asserting that she will \"stay the same\" and that her English-language recordings will refrain from foul language and sexual themes. In 1997, María Celeste Arrarás wrote in her book about Selena's death that the singer was a \"sweet and charismatic girl\". According to Arrarás, Selena \"trusted everyone\"; she often went shopping alone, despite her father's concerns over her safety.\n\nBetty Cortina of People magazine said Selena's provocative choice of clothing was an acceptable emulation of Janet Jackson and Madonna, and that she wore \"sexy outfits that [accentuated] a body of a Latina woman\".[176] Cortina also stated that Selena had a \"flamboyant style, an unbelievable body, curves and booty\".[176] Arrarás wrote that Selena \"began wearing clothes designed to emphasize her curvaceous figure\" and that she \"never came across as cheap—simply sexy\". She also said Selena's makeup regimen was not being \"painted up or vulgar\". Arrarás also noted Selena's \"fun-loving stage manner\" and said she was \"playful onstage and off\".\n\nMatt S. Meier wrote in his book The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia (2010) that Selena exhibited \"contagious energy\" during her concerts and said she displayed \"warmth, passion, and sexuality\" while exuding a \"down-to-earth persona of the wholesome young girl next door\". Selena wore outfits that accented her physical attributes and was not afraid to wear outfits she liked,[176] despite criticism from parents who thought Selena's choice of outfits were inappropriate for young girls, who began emulating Selena. Her views on public image in the fashion industry were bothersome; she said she was opposed to the image that all woman should be \"rail-thin\" and the notion that they must wear certain outfits and be \"super-young to be beautiful\".\n\nIn the early 1990s, Selena began wearing decorative bustiers, spandex or tight pants, and attractive, unbuttoned jackets during her concerts. She was inspired by Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson, and Madonna. During a 1992 interview, Selena said her choice of clothing does not reflect her personality.[176] NBC News called Selena's outfit \"provocative\".[226] Because of her choices of outfits and dance moves, she was named by her fans as the \"Mexican Madonna\". According to Suzette, Selena often designed and sewed her outfits backstage with her designers, moments before she was due on stage. Quintanilla Jr. disapproved of Selena's outfits, but he later accepted it when Selena discussed it being a fashion trend.[176]\n\nSelena became an inactive member of the Jehovah's Witnesses due to her exotic clothing. During the photo shoot for Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), a photographer remarked on the ways Selena's choice of clothing affected Quintanilla Jr. tremendously; he often left sessions when Selena appeared in revealing outfits. Selena was credited as the first woman to change public perceptions of feminine beauty in the Tejano market; a feminist, she blazed a trail for other female artists during her career.[176]\n\nFollowing Selena's death, some celebrities questioned her status as a role model among Hispanic women. In her 1999 documentary about the singer, filmmaker Lourdes Portillo expressed concerns whether Selena was a great role model for young women.[232] Portillo believed Selena was sending the wrong message to young girls by dancing in clothing that suggested hypersexualization. American author Sandra Cisneros agreed with Portillo's assessment that Selena was \"not a good role model to Latina women\". Media outlets also shared Portillo's views; they said the \"fairy tale story\" of Selena was one that her family would want to preserve, questioning Quintanilla Jr.'s role for pushing an image that Selena had \"never made mistakes\" into the media, calling it \"lies\" and \"not the real story\".[235][236]\n\nDuring her childhood, Selena helped organizations such as Toys for Tots. She was active in the U.S. Latino community, visiting local schools to talk to students about the importance of education. At Fulmore Junior High School in Austin, she educated two hundred high school students about positive attitudes and setting life-goals in their adult lives. Selena urged children to stay in school, and that alcohol and drugs will lead them nowhere in life. She spent her free time helping her community. Selena performed in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the forming of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Following the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, Selena helped victims in Florida by performing at a Houston benefit concert.\n\nIn August 1994, Selena hosted a charity baseball game to raise money for unspecified charities. She also donated her time to civic organizations such as D.A.R.E. and planned a fundraising concert to help AIDS patients. Selena participated with the Texas Prevention Partnership which was sponsored by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Dep Corporation), which released an educational video that was sent to students for free. Her pro-education videos included \"My Music\" and \"Selena Agrees\". She was in the works for a Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas Boys & Girls Clubs of America benefit concert.[23]\n\nIn January 1995, Selena headlined the Teach the Children festival in San Antonio. The concert funded a non-profit program to provide school supplies to needy children. Selena was a spokesperson for women in abusive relationships. She also helped out at homeless shelters. According to the A&E television series Biography, Selena's fans were often minorities; she encouraged them to make the most of their lives.[176]\n\nSelena has been credited for helping redefine Latin music and its subgenres of Tejano, cumbia, and Latin pop. Selena broke barriers in the Latin music world.[194][247] She is considered \"one of the most significant Mexican-American singers of the end of the twentieth century\". People magazine named Selena one of the most intriguing people of the 20th century. US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison named Selena one of \"the spirited women who shaped [the United States].\"\n\nSelena became one of the \"most celebrated cultural products\" of the United States-Mexico borderlands. Selena was called the \"Queen of Tejano Music\", and was described as \"the most important and popular Tejano star of all time\". Her death was \"the most devastating loss\" in Tejano music history, according to Zach Quaintance of The Monitor.[247] At the time of her death, Selena became one of the most widely known Mexican-American vocal artists[254] and the most popular Latin artist in the United States.[254] She had a \"cult-like\" following among Hispanics.\n\nSelena has been named one of the most influential Latin artists of all-time and has been credited for elevating a music genre into the mainstream market.[7][8] Latin Post called the singer \"one of the most iconic artists in Latin American music history\",[256] while The New York Times called her \"arguably the most important Latina musician in the country, on her way to becoming one of the most important, period.\"[257] Selena became a household name in the United States and Mexico following her death and became part of the American pop culture.[257] She became more popular in death than when she was alive.\n\nAfter her death, her popularity among the Hispanic population was compared to those of Marilyn Monroe and Madonna in Anglo-American culture. According to author Carlota Caulfield, Selena was \"one of the most popular Latina singers of the 1990s\". Selena's popularity was drawn in by the LGBT community and minority groups in the United States.[263] The popularity of Tejano music waned after her death and has not recovered.[265] John Lannert of Billboard said in an interview with Biography in 2007 that when Selena died the \"Tejano market died with her\".[176]\n\nDreaming of You, the crossover album Selena had been working on at the time of her death, was released in July 1995. It sold 175,000 copies on the day of its release in the U.S.—a then-record for a female vocalist—and sold 331,000 copies its first week.[266][267] Selena became the third female artist to sell over 300,000 units in one week, after Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey.[268] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first album by a Hispanic artist to do so.[269][270][271] Dreaming of You helped Selena to become the first solo artist to debut a posthumous album at number one.[272] Dreaming of You joined five of Selena's studio albums on the Billboard 200 chart simultaneously, making Selena the first female artist in Billboard history to do so.[273] The album was certified 59× platinum (Latin field), for sales of 3.54 million album-equivalent units in the U.S. alone.[78][274]\n\nAs of 2017 it has sold over 2.942 million copies in the U.S. making it the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the country according to Nielsen SoundScan.[275] As of 2015 , the recording has sold five million copies worldwide.[276] In 2008, Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle said its lead single, \"I Could Fall in Love\", had \"made the Tejano goddess a posthumous crossover star\".[277] Her death was believed to have sparked an interest in Latin music by people who were unaware of its existence.[279] It was also believed her death \"open[ed] the doors\" to other Latin musicians such as Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, and Shakira.[281]\n\nIn 1995, the United States Social Security Administration ranked the name Selena one of the 100 most popular names for newborn girls, and namesake Selena Gomez acknowledged Quintanilla's influence.[282] In December 1999, Selena was named the \"top Latin artist of the '90s\" and \"Best selling Latin artist of the decade\" by Billboard for her fourteen top-ten singles in the Top Latin Songs chart, including seven number-one hits.[283] She was the best-selling Latin female singer of the 1990s in the U.S. and Mexico.[284] Selena was named \"Best Female Vocalist of the '80s\" and \"Best Female Vocalist of the '90s\" at the 2010 Tejano Music Awards.[94] In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Selena at number 89 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[285]\n\nIn the months following her death, several honors and tributes were erected. Several proposals were made, such as renaming streets, public parks, food products, and auditoriums. Two months later, a tribute was held at the 1995 Lo Nuestro Awards.[288] The Spirit of Hope Award was created in Selena's honor in 1996;[289] it was awarded to Latin artists who participated in humanitarian and civic causes.[290] On March 16, 2011, the United States Postal Service released a \"Latin Legends\" memorial stamp to honor Selena, Carlos Gardel, Tito Puente, Celia Cruz, and Carmen Miranda.[291] In February 2014, the Albany, New York Times Union named her one of \"100 Coolest Americans in History\".[292] In 1998 Selena was commemorated with a museum.\n\nIn 1995, Selena was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame,[293] the Hard Rock Cafe's Hall of Fame, and the South Texas Music Hall of Fame. In 2001 she was inducted into the Tejano Music Hall of Fame. In 2017, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[294] The unveiling ceremony of her star was attended by around 4,500 fans, which was the largest-ever crowd for an unveiling ceremony at the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[295] She was named one of the 20 most influential Texans of all time by author Laurie Jasinski. She was ranked fifth of the \"100 most influential Latin musicians of the 20th century\" according to the Orange County Register.[296] The singer has been given many epithets by media outlets, including the \"Queen of Cumbia\" or \"Queen of Kumbia\",[297][298][299][g] the \"Chicana Elvis\",[300] the \"Queen of Hybrid Pop Culture\", the \"Hispanic Marilyn Monroe\",[206] the \"Tupac Shakur of Latin Music\",[301] the \"Corpus Christi Queen\",[302] and the \"People's Princess\".[303] Media have compared Selena's fashion sense to that of Madonna more times than any other celebrity.[3][4][5]\n\nIn 1995, Mexican actress Salma Hayek was chosen to portray Selena in a biopic produced by the Quintanilla family and Warner Bros.[306] However, Hayek turned down the role as she felt it was \"too early\" to base a film on Selena, and that it would be emotional since Selena's death was still being covered on American television.[307][308] Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939).[310] Puerto Rican-American actress Jennifer Lopez replaced Hayek, which initially drew criticism because of Lopez's Puerto Rican ancestry, but after seeing her performance, fans changed their views. Gregory Nava directed the film, which was released on March 21, 1997. Selena opened in 1,850 theaters worldwide and grossed $11,615,722, making it the second-highest-grossing film debut that week. With a production budget of $20 million, the film grossed $35 million in the U.S.[312] The film was a commercial and critical success[313] and is often cited by critics as Lopez's breakthrough role.[314] Lopez rose into pop culture, for which the film's success was credited.\n\nIn 1999, a Broadway-bound musical titled Selena was scheduled to premiere in San Antonio in March 2000 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of her murder. Broadway producers Tom Quinn, Jerry Frankel, Peter Fitzgerald, and Michael Vega staged the musical,[316] and Edward Gallardo wrote the show's book and lyrics. Fernando Rivas composed the show's songs. In 2000, Selena Forever was first produced; the show embarked on a 30-city U.S. tour with a budget of over US$2 million.[316] After a national casting call, producers chose Veronica Vasquez to portray Selena; Vasquez alternated in the role with Rebecca Valdez.[317] The musical previewed on March 21, and opened on March 23 at the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium.[318]\n\nSelena's family and her former band, Los Dinos, held a tribute concert on April 7, 2005, a week after the 10th anniversary of her murder. The concert, titled Selena ¡VIVE!, was broadcast live on Univision and achieved a 35.9 household rating. It was the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language television special in the history of American television. The special was also the number-one program in any language among adults ages 18 to 34 in Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco; it tied for first in New York, beating that night's episode of Fox's reality show American Idol.[319] Among Hispanic viewers, Selena ¡VIVE! outperformed Super Bowl XLV and the telenovela Soy tu dueña during the \"most-watched NFL season ever among Hispanics\".[320][321]\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that a two-day annual event called Fiesta de la Flor would be held in Corpus Christi for Selena by the Corpus Christi Visitors Bureau. Musical acts for the first annual event included Kumbia All Starz, Chris Pérez, Los Lobos, Jay Perez, Little Joe y la Familia, Los Palominos, Stefani Montiel of Las 3 Divas, Girl in a Coma's Nina Diaz, Las Fenix, and The Voice contestant Clarissa Serna.[322][323][324] The event raised $13 million with an attendance of 52,000 people, 72% of whom lived outside of Corpus Christi. The event sparked interest from people in 35 states and five different countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador.[325]\n\nOn August 30, 2016, a wax statue of Selena was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hollywood.[326] In October 2016, MAC Cosmetics released a limited edition Selena makeup line after On Air with Ryan Seacrest senior producer Patty Rodriguez started a petition for the company to do so and it garnering over 37,000 signatures.[327] It became the best-selling celebrity line in cosmetic history.[328] She was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame at Texas Woman's University in October 2016.[329] An exhibit at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. that ran in 2017, focused on Selena's influence in marketing. \"Due to her massive appeal to both general and Latino markets, advertisers began targeting specific demographics for the first time.\"[330]\n\nGoogle honored Selena on October 17, 2017, with a musical doodle of her life.[331] On December 11, 2018, it was announced that a biographical television series based on Selena's life titled Selena: The Series would be released on Netflix in December 2020.[332] Actress Christian Serratos plays the leading role as Selena, which was shown in a teaser trailer in late 2019. The two-part series is being done with the participation of the Quintanilla family.[333] Selena: The Series is an American biographical drama streaming television series created by Moisés Zamora and starring Christian Serratos.[334] The first part of the series was released on Netflix on December 4, 2020.[335][336] The second and final part premiered on May 4, 2021.[337]\n\nForever 21 announced the launch of a clothing line celebrating her legacy named \"Selena: The White Rose Collection\", was released in 2019.[338] In a 10-part podcast miniseries, Anything for Selena, broadcast in 2021 by WBUR-FM and Futuro Media, Latina journalist Maria Garcia \"goes on an intimate, revelatory quest to understand how Selena has become a potent symbol for tensions around race, class and body politics in the United States\".[339] In the same year, Selena was posthumously presented with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which her family received on the artist's behalf.[340]\n\nSelena was posthumously awarded a 2023 National Medal of Arts, which was accepted by her sister in a ceremony held in October 2024.[341]\n\nMirador de la Flor (English: Lookout of the Flower)[342] is Selena's own life-size bronze statue monument in Corpus Christi, Texas, sculpted by H. W. \"Buddy\" Tatum and unveiled in 1997.[343] About 30,000 people from around the world visit this monument every year.[344] While the monument has remained a popular tourist attraction, the construction of the statue met some resistance from the local community. Dusty Durrill, a local philanthropist, financed the construction of the monument with support from local community leaders.\n• The New Girl In Town (1985)\n• And the Winner Is... (1987)\n• List of people on the postage stamps of the United States\n• Archival footage related to Selena from the Texas Archive of the Moving ImageQuintanilla Perez, Selena [Selena]: Singer Selena Quintanilla Perez, known simply as Selena, the daughter of Abraham and Marcella (Perez) Quintanilla, Jr., was born on April 16, 1971, in Lake Jackson, Texas. She married Christopher Perez, guitarist and member of the band Selena y Los Dinos (slang for \"the Boys\") on April 2, 1992. They had no children. Selena attended Oran M. Roberts Elementary School in Lake Jackson and West Oso Junior High in Corpus Christi, where she completed the eighth grade. In 1989 she finished high school through the American School, a correspondence school for artists, and enrolled at Pacific Western University in business administration correspondence courses.\n\nHer career began when she was eight. From 1957 to 1971 her father played with Los Dinos, a Tejano band. He taught his children to sing and play in the family band and taught Selena to sing in Spanish. They performed at the family restaurant, Pappagallo, and at weddings in Lake Jackson. After 1981 the band became a professional act. In 1982 the group moved to Corpus Christi and played in rural dance halls and urban nightclubs, where Tejano music flourishes. In her late teens Selena adopted fashions sported by Madonna.\n\nPreceded by Lydia Mendoza and Chelo Silva, Mexican-American star vocalists of the 1930s, and by pioneer orchestra singer Laura Canales in the 1970s, Selena became a star in Tejano music. She won the Tejano Music Award for Female Entertainer of the Year in 1987, and eight other Tejano awards followed. By the late 1980s Selena was known as \"la Reina de la Onda Tejana\" (\"the Queen of Tejano music\") and \"una mujer del pueblo.\" Her popularity soared with annual awards from the Tejano Music Awards and a contract with EMI Latin Records in 1989. At the 1995 Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, the band attracted 61,041 people, more than Clint Black, George Strait, Vince Gill, or Reba McEntire.\n\nSelena y Los Dinos recorded with Tejano labels GP, Cara, Manny, and Freddie before 1989. Their albums include Alpha (1986), Dulce Amor (1988), Preciosa (1988), Selena y Los Dinos (1990), Ven Conmigo (1991), Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), Selena Live (1993), Amor Prohibido (1994), and Dreaming of You (1995). The band's popularity surged with Ven Conmigo. Entre a Mi Mundo made Selena the first Tejana to sell more than 300,000 albums. In 1993 she signed with SBK Records to produce an all-English album, but it was eventually replaced with the bilingual Dreaming of You.\n\nDespite her success in the Spanish-language market, mainstream society largely ignored Selena until around 1993. In 1994 Texas Monthly named her one of twenty influential Texans and the Los Angeles Times interviewed her. That same year, Selena Live won a Grammy for Best Mexican-American Album. Also in 1993 and 1995, Lo Nuestro Billboard gave the band awards in four categories. Selena y Los Dinos was a cross-over act in Tejano, romance, cumbia, tropical, pop, rap, and salsa in Spanish and English; Selena was not only bilingual but biethnic. Before her death, the band sold more than 1.5 million records.\n\nBy the mid-1980s Selena had crossed into the national Latino and Latin-American market. A recording with the Puerto Rican band Barrio Boyzz furthered inroads into this area. Selena y Los Dinos began to acquire a following in Mexico (Matamoros) as early as 1986. Along with Emilio Navaira, Selena y Los Dinos attracted 98,000 fans in Monterrey, and thus popularized Tejano music in Mexico. In 1994 the band played in New York to a Mexican and Central American audience. The band was the first Tejano group to make Billboard's Latin Top 200 list of all-time best-selling records.\n\nSelena was also known to Latin-American television audiences. At the age of twelve or thirteen she was introduced on the Johnny Canales Show. She appeared on Sábado Gigante, Siempre en Domingo, El Show de Cristina, and the soap opera Dos Mujeres, Un Camino. She also made a cameo appearance in the 1995 film Don Juan DeMarco. Advertisements also made Selena popular. Coca-Cola featured her in a poster, and she had a promotional tour agreement with the company. She had a six-figure contract with Dep Corporation and a contract with AT&T and Southwestern Bell. A six-figure deal with EMI Latin made her a millionaire. In 1992 she began her own clothing line. In 1994 she opened Selena Etc., a boutique–salon in Corpus Christi and San Antonio. At the time of her death she had plans to open others in Monterrey and Puerto Rico. A 1994 Hispanic magazine stated her worth at $5 million. Despite her wealth, however, she lived in the working-class district of Molina in Corpus Christi.\n\nSelena considered herself a public servant. She participated with the Texas Prevention Partnership, sponsored by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Dep Corporation) Tour to Schools, in an educational video. She was also involved with the D.A.R.E. program and worked with the Coastal Bend Aids Foundation. Her pro-education videos included My Music and Selena Agrees. She was scheduled for a Dallas–Fort Worth boys' and girls' club benefit. Selena taped a public-service announcement for the Houston Area Women's Center, a shelter for battered women, in 1993.\n\nOn March 31, 1995, Selena was shot fatally in the back by Yolanda Saldivar, her first fan club founder and manager of Selena Etc., in Corpus Christi. The New York Times covered her death with a front-page story, as did Texas major dailies. Six hundred persons attended her private Jehovah's Witness funeral. More than 30,000 viewed her casket at the Bayfront Plaza Convention Center in Corpus Christi. Hundreds of memorials and Masses were offered for her across the country; on April 16, for instance, a Mass was celebrated on her behalf at Our Lady Queen of Angels Church in Los Angeles. Her promotion agency, Rogers and Cowan, received more than 500 requests for information about her. Entertainment Tonight and Dateline NBC ran short stories on her, and People magazine sold a commemorative issue. Spanish-language television and radio sponsored numerous tributes, typically half-hour or hour programs.\n\nSelena's fans compared the catastrophe to the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, and Pedro Infante. Songs, quilts, paintings, T-shirts, buttons, banners, posters, and shrines honored her. Radio talker Howard Stern of New York, however, snickered at her music and enraged her fans. Bo Corona, a disc jockey at a Houston Tejano radio station, asked him to apologize, and the League of United Latin American Citizens organized a boycott of his sponsors. Selena's death became part of the controversy over the Texas concealed-handgun bill. Her death also fostered greater awareness of Tejano music. According to superstar Little Joe, as a result of Selena's death \"the word Tejano has been recognized by millions.\" Governor George W. Bush proclaimed April 16, 1995, \"Selena Day.\" Selena's family founded the Selena Foundation. Her bilingual album, Dreaming of You, was released posthumously in 1995 and was the first Tejano album to hit number one in the United States.\n\nSelena's killer, Yolanda Saldivar, was convicted by a Houston jury. In 2002 Nueces County Judge Jose Longoria ordered that the murder weapon, a .38-caliber revolver, be destroyed and its pieces scattered in Corpus Christi Bay. Some musicologists and fans felt that the gun should have been preserved in a museum for its historical significance, while others were glad to see the destruction of the instrument of the singer's death.\n\nIn the years after Selena's death, the singer's popularity has remained very strong. Numerous honors have been awarded posthumously. The city of Corpus Christi erected a memorial, Mirador de la Flor (\"Overlook of the Flower\"), which included a life-sized bronze statue, to the fallen singer in 1997. That same year, a movie about her life—Selena—was released and starred newcomer Jennifer Lopez in the leading role. The Quintanilla family opened the Selena Museum in Corpus Christi in 1998, and in 2001 she was inducted into the Tejano R.O.O.T.S. Hall of Fame. She is also a member of the South Texas Music Walk of Fame.\n\nOn April 7, 2005, a tribute concert \"Selena ¡VIVE!\" was broadcast live from Houston's Reliant Stadium. Attended by more than 65,000 fans, the event featured famous artists performing Selena's songs. The live broadcast on the Univision Network became the highest-rated Spanish-language program in American television history. In 2011 the United States Postal Service honored Selena as a “Latin Legend” with the issue of a memorial postage stamp. In April 2015 the city of Corpus Christi hosted the first annual Fiesta de la Flor, a two-day festival celebrating the life and legacy of the singer. A portion of the profits was donated to the Selena Foundation. Selena was inducted into the Texas Women’s Hall of Fame in 2016.Murder of Selena - Wikipedia: On the morning of March 31, 1995, the American singer Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was shot and fatally wounded at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi, Texas. Although paramedics tried to revive Selena, she died of hypovolemic shock at Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at age 23. The killer, Yolanda Saldívar, was an American nurse and the president of Selena's fan club who was exposed as having embezzled thousands of dollars from the singer's earnings.\n\nThe Latino community was deeply affected by the news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Kurt Cobain and John F. Kennedy. On April 12, 1995, two weeks after her death, then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas.\n\nAt the time of Selena's death, Tejano music was one of the most popular Latin music subgenres in the U.S. Selena was called the \"Queen of Tejano Music\" and became the first Latina artist to have a predominantly Spanish-language album—Dreaming of You (1995)—debut and peak at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. After her death, the popularity of Tejano music waned. During Saldívar's trial for the murder—called the \"trial of the century\" and the most important trial for the Latino population. Saldívar said she accidentally shot Selena while attempting suicide, but the jury at her trial did not believe her; she was found guilty of first-degree murder and given a life imprisonment sentence, with the possibility of parole after 30 years.\n\nJennifer Lopez was cast as Selena in a 1997 biopic film about her life and achieved fame after the film's release.\n\nSelena Quintanilla-Pérez was born on April 16, 1971, at Freeport Community Hospital in Freeport, Texas,[1][2] to Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., a former musician, and Marcella Ofelia Quintanilla (née Samora).[3] Selena was introduced to the music industry by her father, who saw \"a way back into the music business\" after discovering Selena's \"perfect timing and pitch\".[4] Abraham quickly organized his children into a band called Selena y Los Dinos, which included A.B. Quintanilla III on bass, Suzette Quintanilla on drums and Selena as the lead singer.[4] The band became the family's main source of income after they were evicted from their home during the Texas oil bust of 1982.[4] They filed for bankruptcy after Abraham's Mexican restaurant suffered as a result of the oil bust.[4][5]\n\nThe Quintanilla family moved to Corpus Christi, Texas, and Selena y Los Dinos began recording music professionally.[4][5] In 1984 the band released its first LP record, Selena y Los Dinos, with a small, independent record company.[6] Abraham wanted his children to record Tejano music—a male-dominated music genre popularized by Mexican-Americans in the United States.[8] Selena's popularity as a singer grew after she won the Tejano Music Award for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1987.[9] She landed her first major record deal with Capitol EMI Latin in 1989.[10]\n\nYolanda Saldívar, a 34-year-old former nurse from San Antonio, became a fan of Tejano music in the mid-1980s. Saldívar had originally disliked Selena because she had won awards for which Saldívar's favorite Tejano musicians were nominated. In mid-1991, Saldívar and her niece attended one of Selena's concerts in San Antonio. She subsequently became an ardent Selena fan; she enjoyed the singer's stage presence and especially liked the song \"Baila Esta Cumbia\". The day after the concert, Saldívar unsuccessfully searched news stands for a souvenir of the event. She got the idea of starting a Selena fan club in the San Antonio area to promote the singer. According to Abraham, Saldívar tried contacting him and left him fifteen messages; she said she left only three. Abraham contacted her to discuss her idea of starting a fan club. After meeting Saldívar in person, he approved of her idea and gave her permission to proceed.\n\nSaldívar became the founder and acting president of the Selena fan club in San Antonio in June 1991. As president, she was responsible for membership benefits and collecting $22 in exchange for products promoting Selena, a T-shirt bearing the singer's name, exclusive interviews with Selena y Los Dinos, a fact sheet about the band and notifications of upcoming concerts. Proceeds from the fan club were donated to charities. Selena's sister Suzette was the contact person between Saldívar and the Quintanilla family; Saldívar did not meet Selena herself until December 1991. The two became close friends and the Quintanilla family trusted her.\n\nBy 1994, Saldívar had signed up more than 8,000 fans. According to television news reporter and anchorwoman María Celeste Arrarás, she had become the \"most efficient assistant\" Selena ever had. Arrarás wrote that people noticed how eager Saldívar was to impress Selena and did anything the singer told her to do. One person told Arrarás, \"If Selena would say, 'Jump!', [Saldívar] would jump three times\". Saldívar gave up her career as an in-home nurse to fully invest her time in running the Selena fan club, although she was earning less than she had in her previous career.\n\nIn 1994, Selena opened two boutiques called Selena Etc. in Corpus Christi and San Antonio, both equipped with in-house beauty salons. Her father thought Saldívar was a potential candidate to run the businesses because the family would be touring the country, based on her success in running the fan club. The rest of the family agreed; in January 1994, Saldívar became the manager of the boutiques. In September 1994, Selena signed Saldívar as her registered agent in San Antonio. After being hired to run the boutiques, Saldívar moved from South San Antonio to Corpus Christi to be closer to Selena. In an interview with Primer Impacto in 1995, Abraham said he personally \"always mistrusted Saldívar\", though the family never found anything odd about her behavior. Saldívar was authorized to write and cash checks, and had access to bank accounts associated with the fan club and boutiques.\n\nSelena gave Saldívar her American Express card for the purpose of conducting company business. Saldívar instead used it to rent luxury cars, entertain associates in upmarket restaurants and buy two cellular phones which she carried. Staff at Selena Etc. complained that Saldívar was always \"nice\" when Selena was around, but treated everyone terribly when the singer was away. By December 1994, the boutiques' bank accounts lacked sufficient funds to pay bills. Staff levels at both stores had been reduced from 38 to 14 employees, mainly because Saldívar fired those she disliked. The remaining employees complained to Selena, but the singer did not believe her friend would hurt her or her business. Employees reportedly told Selena that Saldívar was \"two-faced [and] was unstable\".[26] The employees then began to take their concerns to Selena's father, who warned her that Saldívar might be dangerous. Selena did not believe Saldívar would turn on her; her father had a habit of distrusting people.\n\nIn January 1995, Selena's cousin, Debra Ramirez, was hired to work in the boutiques and to help Selena expand the business into Mexico. She quit within a week, telling Saldívar she was dissatisfied with the failure of staff members to report sales. Ramirez also found receipts were missing from the sale of several boutique items. Saldívar told her to \"mind [her] business\" and that it was not her concern.\n\nSaldívar also clashed with Martin Gomez, Selena's fashion designer, who complained that Saldívar was mismanaging the singer's affairs. Their animosity intensified during Selena's fashion shows, with Gomez accusing Saldívar of mutilating or destroying some of his original creations and never paying bills. The two constantly complained about each other to Selena. Saldívar began recording their conversations without Gomez's consent to persuade Selena he was not working for the boutiques' best interests. Gomez was relegated to a supporting role when Selena decided to design her clothes herself.\n\nBetween late 1994 and early 1995, Saldívar often traveled to Monterrey, to expedite the process of opening another Selena Etc. store in Mexico. When Saldívar visited the factory there, she intimidated the seamstresses by telling them to either side with her or leave.\n\nSaldívar received \"tokens of affection from [Selena]\", which she was not accustomed to. Her room was covered with Selena posters and pictures, burning votive candles and a library of Selena videotapes which she played to entertain guests. During an interview with Saldívar in 1995, reporters from The Dallas Morning News said her devotion to Selena bordered on obsession. Saldívar told employees at Selena Etc. she wanted to \"be like Selena\". According to an unnamed former employee, she was \"possessive\" of her relationship with Selena, and tried to exert control by distancing the singer from the other employees. Saldívar said her reason for doing so was to \"shield\" the singer from the \"petty issues\" of managing her boutiques. Along with the responsibility of running the boutiques, Saldívar accompanied Selena on trips and had keys to the singer's house.\n\nWhen Saldívar became a business associate, her relationship with Selena began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, a doctor who lived in Monterrey, to inquire about opening a Selena Etc. location there. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her.[nb 1]\n\nSaldívar became jealous of Selena's dependency on Martinez, who began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. She warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several thousand dollars to Selena because she was short on cash.\n\nStarting in January 1995, Abraham began receiving telephone calls and letters from angry fans who claimed to have paid their enrollment fees for the fan club, but had not received the promised memorabilia. Meanwhile, at both of Selena's boutiques in Corpus Christi and San Antonio, employees noted an influx of unpaid or overdue bills arriving in the mail, for which Saldívar could provide no plausible explanation.[34] Upon investigation, Abraham discovered Saldívar had embezzled more than $60,000 using forged checks from both the fan club and the boutiques.\n\nSaldívar's brother, Armando, supposedly contacted Gomez and \"made up a story\" that she was stealing money from the fan club. Gomez then contacted one of Selena's uncles by telephone; the uncle then told Abraham. Armando said he was angry with Saldívar but did not want the reason why to be made public; later he said he felt guilty for starting the rumor. He appeared on the Spanish-language television news program Primer Impacto, but reporters found his comments illogical.\n\nOn March 9, 1995, Abraham held a meeting with Selena and Suzette at Q-Productions to confront Saldívar about the embezzlement. Abraham presented Saldívar with evidence concerning the missing funds, to which she simply stared at him without denying the accusations or answering questions. He later recalled that Saldívar was \"emotional at times [and at other times] just cool as ice.\"[37] When he asked why fans were not receiving their promised gift packages, Saldívar said those fans were trying to get the items for free. Abraham had also discovered that Saldívar had opened the fan club's bank account under the name of her sister, \"Maria Elida.\" When asked why she had done this, Saldívar replied that the bank would not allow her to open an account in her name; she did not know the reason for this refusal.\n\nSaldívar abruptly left the meeting; Abraham banned her from contacting Selena as a result. However, Selena did not want to end their friendship; she felt Saldívar was essential to the success of her clothing line in Mexico, and felt she needed Saldívar's bank records, statements and financial records for tax purposes. Saldívar's name remained on the payroll after the meeting, though her termination was pending on the retrieval of the financial records that were stolen.[39][40] Despite her initial reluctance, Selena told Suzette on March 25 that she was planning on terminating Saldívar's employment \"soon\".[40]\n\nAfter the meeting, Abraham discovered the fan club's checks were signed with Maria Elida's signature in handwriting identical to Saldívar's. He concluded that Saldívar was writing forged checks using her sister's name, then cashing them and keeping the funds. When he tried to retrieve the fan club's bank statements, he said they had \"vanished\". He found a letter in Saldívar's handwriting stating that Maria Elida had to close the bank account because of a major problem. According to the letter, a member of the fan club, \"Yvonne Perales\", was sent to the bank to deposit $3,000, but Perales did not deposit the money and could not be found. The letter stated that Maria Elida found out about the situation \"too late\" and that Perales and the money were missing.\n\nMaria Elida then wrote checks to be cashed by Saldívar, even though the bank account had no funds. The letter said Maria Elida was closing the account for that reason and that the bank would have to cover the checks. Abraham confronted Saldívar about Perales' identity; he said Saldívar knew nothing about her. Abraham said Saldívar did not trust the treasurer of the fan club, but she had trusted a complete stranger to deposit $3,000. He told Saldívar to \"tell that lie to someone else\". He concluded that Perales did not exist, since none of the fan club workers had ever met her.\n\nThe day after Saldívar was banned from contacting Selena, Abraham drove to Q-Productions and chased her off the premises. That same day, Selena and Saldívar argued by telephone. The singer and her husband were unsatisfied with Saldívar's explanation for why the items were unaccounted for.[43]\n\nAccording to Abraham, there were four attempts to murder Selena. On March 10, 1995, Selena removed Saldívar's name from the boutique's bank account and replaced Saldívar as president of the fan club. The next day, Saldívar purchased a gun at A Place to Shoot, a gun shop and shooting range in San Antonio. She bought a Taurus Model 85 snub-nosed .38-caliber revolver and .38 caliber hollow-point bullets, which are a type of expanding bullet which cause a more lethal impact and more extensive injuries than typical bullets. Saldívar told the clerk she needed protection in her job as an in-home nurse because a patient's relatives had threatened her.\n\nOn March 13, Saldívar went to her lawyer and wrote her resignation, which Abraham believed was her alibi. That same day, while Selena was visiting Miami, Saldívar drove to Corpus Christi and checked into the Sand and Sea Motel. Abraham believed this would have been the first attempt to kill Selena. When Selena arrived in Corpus Christi on March 14, Saldívar contacted her to schedule a meeting. Saldívar told Selena there was too much traffic and asked her to meet her at a parking lot 25 miles (40 km) away from Corpus Christi. Upon arriving, Selena told Saldívar she could remain in charge of her business affairs in Mexico.\n\nAccording to Abraham, Selena wanted to continue employing Saldívar until she could find a replacement. Saldívar showed Selena the gun she had bought. Selena told her to \"get rid of it\" and said she would protect Saldívar from Abraham, according to Saldívar and Pérez.[48] This, Abraham believed, calmed Saldívar and dissuaded her from killing Selena in the parking lot. The next day, Saldívar returned the gun to the shop saying her father had given her a .22 caliber pistol. On March 26, Saldívar stole a perfume sample and more bank statements from Selena in Mexico.\n\nSaldívar accompanied Selena on a trip to Tennessee while the singer finished recording a song for her crossover album. The singer told Saldívar some bank statements were missing and asked her to return them as soon as they returned to Texas. Saldívar re-purchased the gun on March 27 and asked Selena to meet her alone at a motel room. However, news of Selena's arrival spread and she was soon mobbed by fans. Abraham believed Selena's fans saved her that day from a second murder attempt, as there were \"too many witnesses\".\n\nAccording to Abraham, the third murder attempt occurred during Saldívar's trip to Monterrey in the last week of March. Martinez received telephone calls from Saldívar crying hysterically and saying she had been raped on March 29. Saldívar made another call to Martinez the following day, with Martinez recalling later that it sounded as though someone was trying to snatch away the telephone on her end. He sent an employee to Saldívar's motel room to investigate. The employee found she had left a few minutes earlier.\n\nOn March 30, Saldívar returned from Monterrey and checked into a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi. She contacted Selena and told her she had been raped. According to Abraham this was the last message, which he believed was her new alibi, that the family received from Saldívar. Saldívar asked Selena to visit her at her motel room alone, but her husband Pérez accompanied her. According to Pérez, he waited by his truck as Selena went alone into Saldívar's motel room.\n\nAs Pérez was driving back to their house, Selena noticed Saldívar had failed to give her the correct bank statements she needed. Saldívar tried contacting Selena through her pager; she desperately wanted Selena to take her to a hospital, claiming she was bleeding due to her rape. Abraham believed Saldívar was trying to get Selena to return to the motel alone. Pérez told Selena it was \"too late\" and did not want her to go out alone. Unbeknownst to Pérez, Selena agreed to meet Saldívar the next morning.[52]\n\nOn March 30, 1995, Selena contacted Leonard Wong about the perfume samples he had made for her. According to Wong, the singer told him she would be meeting Saldívar the next morning to pick up the samples that had been stolen from her. That same day, Selena told an employee at the boutique she was expecting to fire Saldívar. The employee followed Selena to her home that night because she was concerned over the singer after their discussion about Saldívar.[55] At 7:30 a.m. (CST) on March 31, Selena left for Saldívar's motel room.[nb 2]\n\nAt the motel, Saldívar told Selena she had been raped in Mexico.[58] Selena took her to Doctors Regional Hospital,[nb 3] where medical staff noticed Saldívar showed \"clear symptoms of depression\". Saldívar told medical staff she had bled \"a little\", to which Selena angrily responded that Saldívar had told her the opposite, that she was bleeding copiously the day before. Nurse Carla Anthony informed Saldívar she needed to travel to San Antonio to obtain a gynecological examination because she \"was a resident of San Antonio, the hospital was in Corpus, and the rape occurred outside the country\".[61]\n\nWhile driving back to the motel, Selena told Saldívar it would be best if they stayed apart for a while to avoid upsetting Abraham. According to Martinez, the singer had tried to contact him that morning but he was unavailable due to performing surgery. At 10:00 a.m. (CST), Abraham contacted Pérez to determine Selena's whereabouts; she was due to record a song at Q-Productions that morning and had not arrived. He called Selena on her cellular phone[nb 4] and reminded her of the scheduled recording. She told him she had forgotten the session and she was \"taking care of one last [item of] business\" and would be at Q-Productions soon after. This was the last telephone call Selena answered and the last time Pérez spoke to his wife.\n\nAt the motel room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing, which other motel guests overheard. Selena told Saldívar she could no longer be trusted,[63] and demanded the return of her financial papers.[5] Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48 a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed her weapon at Selena.[5] As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar fired a bullet on the lower right shoulder, puncturing an artery and causing her to bleed profusely.[63] Trinidad Espinoza, the motel's maintenance man, reported hearing a \"loud bang\", which he likened to a car engine misfiring.[65]\n\nSelena was critically wounded. She ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood 392 feet (119 m) long.[63] She was seen clutching her chest screaming, \"Help me! Help me! I've been shot!\". Saldívar chased after her, raising the revolver and calling her a \"bitch\".[67] According to motel staff, Saldívar seemed \"calm\" and went back in her room after chasing Selena.[55] According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him.[69] She grabbed Morales and screamed, \"They'll shoot me again!\".[69][70] Motel staff noticed the singer's clothes were \"soaked in blood\" when she approached the lobby.[70]\n\nSelena fell to the floor at 11:49 a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz summoned emergency services. The singer told the staff, \"Lock the door! She'll shoot me again!” [70] She identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot.[72] Selena was \"mortally wounded [and] terrified\" when she identified Saldívar, having said her last words \"Yolanda... (room) 158.\"[70] Her condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Motel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often.[63] He noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.[65]\n\nAn ambulance arrived at the scene in one minute and 55 seconds.[63] Paramedics tore away the green sweater where the bleeding was taking place and applied a Vaseline gauze to Selena's wound, which stopped the surface bleeding.[63] Her heartbeat was very slow. One paramedic performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation to keep her blood circulating.[63] Paramedic Richard Fredrickson said \"it was too late\" when he arrived in the lobby. He found a \"thick [pool of blood] from her neck to her knees, all the way around on both sides [of her body]\". Fredrickson could not locate a pulse. When he placed his fingers on her neck, he felt only muscle twitches.[75]\n\nA paramedic tried inserting an intravenous needle into Selena, but her veins had collapsed because of the massive blood loss and low (or no) blood pressure, making the insertion extremely difficult. Local police closed off Navigation Boulevard.[63] When paramedics delivered Selena to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital at 12:00 p.m. (CST), her pupils were fixed and dilated, there was no evidence of neurological function, she had no vital signs, and was declared clinically brain dead.[77] Doctors were able to establish an \"erratic heartbeat\" long enough to transfer her to the trauma room.[78] Doctors began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena's chest and finding massive internal bleeding.[63]\n\nSelena's right lung was damaged, her collarbone was shattered and her veins were emptied of blood. Doctors widened her chest opening, administered drugs into her heart and applied pressure to her wounds.[79] Dr. Louis Elkins, cardiac surgeon, arrived at Memorial Hospital and said he saw doctors making \"heroic efforts\" to revive Selena.[77] He described the singer as being \"extremely contused and shredded. The right side of her chest, all the tissue was ripped.\"[80] By the time Elkins arrived, an emergency doctor began \"massaging her heart\" after it had stopped beating.[81] Elkins reported how all efforts were futile and said had he been the receiving doctor, he would not have made any treatments on Selena. He felt \"obligated to continue\" after the emergency room doctor made the decision to reanimate the singer.[82]\n\nElkins said a \"pencil-size artery leading from the heart had been cut in two by the hollow-point bullet\" and that six units of blood from the transfusion had spilled out from her circulatory system.[79] A breathing tube was administered after Selena stopped breathing on her own, while a clamp was placed on her \"gushing\" pierced artery on her collarbone.[81] After 50 minutes, the doctors realized the damage was irreparable.[63] Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was pronounced dead on March 31, 1995 at 1:05 p.m. (CST) at age 23, from blood loss and cardiac arrest.[63][83]\n\nDuring the third hour after the shooting, an autopsy was performed due to overwhelming media interest.[86] It revealed that the bullet had entered Selena's upper right back, near her shoulder blade, passed through her chest cavity, severed the right subclavian artery, and exited her right upper chest.[63] It took minutes from the point of impact of the bullet that Selena lost \"virtually all the blood in her body\" which contributed to her rapidly bleeding to death.[87] Doctors said that if the bullet had been only one millimeter higher or lower, the wound would have been less severe.[63]\n\nAfter the shooting, Saldívar entered her pickup truck and tried to leave the motel parking lot.[69] Motel employee Rosario Garza saw her leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later thought she was going to Q-Productions to shoot Abraham and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a patrol car. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the patrol car.[63] Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple and threatened to commit suicide.[69] A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O. J. Simpson's planned suicide ten months earlier.\n\nLarry Young and Isaac Valencia began negotiating with Saldívar. They ran a telephone line to their base of operations adjacent to Saldívar's pickup truck as the standoff continued. Lead negotiator Young tried to establish a rapport with Saldívar and persuade her to give herself up. Valencia suggested the shooting was accidental. Saldívar later changed her story, saying the \"gun went off\" by itself.[63] She spoke to relatives in addition to speaking with police.[69] Motel guests were ordered to remain in their rooms until police escorted them out. Later that afternoon, police drained the gasoline from the gas tank of Saldívar's car and turned on floodlights.[69]\n\nAfter the standoff entered its fourth hour, Valencia succeeded in getting Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. She said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena tried to tell her not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it.[63] She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver and pointed it at her head again.[63]\n\nSaldívar surrendered after more than nine hours.[5] By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene. Many wept as police took Saldívar away.[5][63] A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Selena's father and Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung told the press the possible motive was the singer's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.[93][94]\n\nWhen San Antonio radio station KEDA-AM broke the news of Selena's death, many people assumed the staff were lying because the next day was April Fools' Day. Other major Spanish-language radio stations in San Antonio, including Tejano 107, KXTN-FM and KRIO-FM, began monitoring developments. Radio stations in Texas began playing Selena's music non-stop and taking telephone calls from distressed fans.[96] All major U.S. networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news.[97] The lead item on news programs in Corpus Christi had been the end of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Within thirty minutes of its announcement, however, Selena's murder was the lead item on all television stations in South Texas.\n\nSelena's death was front-page news in The New York Times for two days, and was featured prominently on BBC World News. News of the singer's death reached Japan, where David Byrne first heard of the shooting. Univision and Telemundo were among the first national news stations to arrive at the crime scene. Coverage of the singer's death and the murder trial dominated American newscasts in 1995.[102] Carlos Lopez of KMIQ-105.1 told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that \"Tejano music is dead for at least today\" and compared the reactions to Selena's death to reactions to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and called March 31, 1995, \"Black Friday\".[69] The media response the murder received was \"unprecedented\" for a Latin artist, and Hispanic writers expressed how the mainstream media typically ignored \"people from the border\".[103][104]\n\nNewsstands were swarmed by people looking for items concerning Selena.[105] A line for the edition of April 1, 1995, of the Caller Times formed. The company added 11,000 copies to their print run and later printed 20,000 more copies to meet continued demand for the paper.[106] Texas newspaper The Monitor, sold out two issues in the days following the singer's death, \"a truly remarkable feat\" said writer Daniel Cavazos. He continued that the event of a newspaper issue selling out happens once every two-three decades.[104] A People magazine issue was released several days after her murder. Despite its publishers' assumption that interest would soon wane, a commemorative issue sold nearly a million copies,[107] selling the entire first and second run within two weeks. It became a collector's item—a first in the history of People.[108] Betty Cortina, editor of People, later said, \"it was unheard of\" for an issue to completely sell out.[108] In the following months, the success of the Selena issue led the company to release People en Español aimed at the Latino market.[108] This was followed by Newsweek en Español and Latina magazine.[109]\n\nAmerican actress Jennifer Lopez was cast to play Selena in the 1997 biopic film about her life; this choice drew criticism because Lopez' ancestry is Puerto Rican rather than Mexican. After the film's release, fans changed their views on Lopez after seeing her performance in the movie.[110][111] Lopez became famous after the film's release.[112][113][114][115][116] Selena: The Series is an American biographical drama streaming television series created by Moisés Zamora and starring Christian Serratos.[117] The series was released on Netflix on December 4, 2020.[118][119] The second and final part of the series premiered on May 4, 2021.[120]\n\nSelena's life and career were covered by a number of television programs, including The Oprah Winfrey Show,[121] E! True Hollywood Story, VH1's Behind the Music, American Justice, Snapped, and Famous Crime Scene.[122][123][124] Other networks including MTV,[122] Investigation Discovery, The Biography Channel, and A&E Network have aired special programs about Selena,[123][125] while Spanish-language networks regularly show documentaries to commemorate the anniversary of her death.[126] These Spanish-language documentaries often score record ratings for Spanish networks.[127][129] A documentary titled Selena, A Star is Dimmed—one of the first about her—was broadcast on Univison's Primer Impacto on April 22, 1995. It was watched by 2.09 million people and became the second-most-viewed Spanish-language show in the history of American television at the time.\n\nNetworks competed with each other to interview Saldívar about the shooting. When the news came out that Arrarás was able to interview her, Univision was inundated with requests to use the interview from major networks as far away as Germany. The interview on Primer Impacto was watched by 4.5 million viewers; it was the most-watched program that night according to the Nielsen ratings, and became one of the most-watched Spanish-language programs in American television history.\n\nThe news of Selena's death deeply affected the Latino community. Many people traveled thousands of miles to visit Selena's house, boutiques, and the crime scene.[133] Hispanics throughout the United States reportedly mourned the singer as far away as New York City and Los Angeles.[134] By mid-afternoon, police were asked to form a detour as a line of automobiles began backing up traffic from the Quintanillas' house. On the street where Selena had lived, gang graffiti and cacti distinguished the blue-collar community from other subdivisions across America.\n\nA chain-link fence in front of Selena's house became a shrine festooned with mementos as fans from across America left messages to Selena and the Quintanilla family. Most car drivers in Corpus Christi, and those driving cars on Interstate 37 from Mexico, turned their headlights on in her memory. Fans scribbled notes and messages, and placed them on the door and doorstep of the room in which Selena had been shot.\n\nSoon after learning of Selena's death, people began speculating about the identity of her murderer. Some fans thought Emilio Navaira's wife had shot Selena; they believed she was jealous of Selena and Navaira's relationship. Johnny Pasillas, Emilio's brother-in-law and manager, frantically called radio stations in an attempt to quash the rumor. Among the celebrities who believed the rumor were record producer Manny Guerra, Pete Rodriguez, and American singer Ramon Hernandez. According to anchorwoman Arrarás, Selena's death became \"the most important news [story] of the year for Latinos\". Texas Monthly editor Pamela Colloff wrote that reactions to her death were equivalent to those following a political assassination.[140] Reactions were compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy.\n\nSelena had a \"cult-like\" following among Latinos; after her death she became a household name in the United States and a part of the American pop culture. She was more popular after her death than when she was alive.[140] Selena became a cultural icon for Latinos and was seen as \"a woman who was proud of her roots [who had] achieved her dreams\".[147] According to Antonio Lopez of The Santa Fe New Mexican, the day Selena was killed \"is a bookmark in time in the memories of many Latinos\".[148] According to Arrarás, \"women imitated her, men worshiped her\". In the aftermath of Selena's murder, two linked deaths in California were reported. A drag queen planned to dress as Selena for a performance; he was hit by a car and left to die. Actress Gloria de la Cruz auditioned for the role of Selena; her body was later found in a dumpster in Los Angeles. Her killer had strangled her and set her body on fire.\n\nSpanish singer Julio Iglesias interrupted a recording session in Miami for a moment of silence. Among the celebrities who contacted the Quintanilla family following the news were Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz, Julio Iglesias, and Madonna. Concerts throughout Texas were canceled; La Mafia canceled their concert in Guatemala and flew back to Texas. Tejano singer Ramiro Herrera and dozens of other Tejano artists also canceled their concerts.[151] Ben Benavidez, radio personality and owner of Tejano Review, told Corpus Christi Caller Times that March 31 would be remembered as \"the worst day in Corpus Christi history\".[96]\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Rhett Lawrence published an advertisement in Billboard magazine's April 22, 1995 issue; it said, \"music I heard with you was more than music. You will be deeply missed.\"[152] Other celebrities interviewed on radio stations, including Stefanie Ridel, Jaime DeAnda (of Los Chamacos), Elsa Garcia,[96] and Shelly Lares, expressed their thoughts about Selena's death. Talk show host Oprah Winfrey called Selena's life \"short but significant\" during a March 1997 episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show.[121] American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey told MTV Selena's death was shocking to her because of \"the way it had happened so abruptly in a young life\".[153]\n\nAmerican singer Marc Anthony dedicated his album Todo a Su Tiempo (which was released two months after Selena's death) to Selena.[154] State senator Carlos Truan and state representative Solomon P. Ortiz reportedly mourned Selena's death.[155] American music industry executive Daniel Glass told Texas Monthly he believed Selena would have enjoyed greater career success had it not been for her death.[140] A few days after her death, president of the United States Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary sent a letter of condolence to Selena's husband Chris Pérez.[156]\n\nA few days later, Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and mourners, and criticized her music. Stern said, \"This music does absolutely nothing for me. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul ... Spanish people have the worst taste in music. They have no depth.\" He then played Selena's songs with gunshot noises in the background.[158] Stern's comments and actions outraged and infuriated the Latino community in Texas. After an arrest warrant for disorderly conduct was issued for him, Stern made an on-air statement, in Spanish, saying his comments were not made to cause \"more anguish to her family, friends and those who loved her\".[160][161]\n\nThe League of United Latin American Citizens found Stern's apology unacceptable and urged a boycott of his show.[162] Texas retailers removed products related to Stern. Sears and McDonald's sent a letter expressing their disapproval of Stern's comments to the media because fans believed they sponsored his show. Within a week, on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers were asked if Stern's remarks about Selena were acceptable. Quivers decided not to talk about the situation to avoid arguing with Stern. When Linda Ronstadt, a pop singer of Mexican-American heritage, appeared on the show, she defended Selena, and argued with Quivers over the matter.\n\nOn April 12, 1995, two weeks after Selena's death, then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas.[165][166] Bush said Selena represented \"the essence of south Texas culture\". On Selena Day, approximately a thousand fans gathered at her grave and began singing traditional Mexican folk songs; police were brought in to control the crowd. On the same day, a crowd of three thousand attended an organized mass of the resurrection for Selena at Johnnyland Concert Park.\n\nIn April and May that year, some European-Americans in Texas wrote to the editor of the Brazosport Facts questioning the fuss over her death; some were offended because Selena Day coincided with Easter Sunday. Others said, \"Easter is more important than Selena Day,\" and believed people should let Selena rest in peace and get on with their lives. Mexican-Americans living in Texas also wrote to the newspaper; some felt that others were too critical of Selena Day, stating they did not need to celebrate the day and should not have responded to its announcement so rudely.\n\nThis was also seen by the Caller Times, which said it had printed several of the negative comments left by people and that many other comments were \"unprintable\".[106] Latino filmmaker Lourdes Portillo said she did not know who Selena was when she heard about the shooting.[171] The Monitor received negative backlash from some readers who felt it was \"enough\" of having Selena featured on the front page of their newspaper. A reader called The Monitor and stated that intelligent people had no interest in Selena.[104] In response, an editor said \"I hope not. That would make for a lot of idiots in [South Texas].\"[104]\n\nWhen the news of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was and said she was \"not that important\", suggesting Latinos \"get over it\".[173] Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans \"didn't understand what all the fuss was about\".[140] This was echoed in the Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. Educators who had observed the reactions said, \"the emergence of an icon in a minority culture can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos\".[174]\n\nMelicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand \"the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against\". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. Some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be paid for by taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers about the media interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. Some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes said many of the people complaining about the media exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.[174]\n\nRamiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News confirmed that the reactions of non-Hispanics were due to a language barrier.[175] Dolph Tillotson, a columnist in The Galveston Daily News, was \"mystified\" about his newspaper's coverage on Selena's death, whom he never heard of. Tillotson was baffled that the singer was important to Hispanics and relatively unknown to most European-Americans. He wrote how grateful he was to the newspaper's Hispanic staff who explained the singer's cultural importance to him.[176]\n\nIn the 1997 biopic film about Selena, a store manager asks Latinos running towards the singer for an autograph, \"Who's Selena?\"[177] European-Americans felt the scene was \"irrelevant\" and \"over dramatized\". One Selena fan said the event depicted in the scene \"happens all the time\" to Latinos and their friends, and that they felt their community had been \"ignored\". Lauraine Miller said, \"Selena has opened my eyes\", and that Miller had become \"more American\". Another fan said, \"nobody ever lets you forget you are Mexican American\" in the U.S.[178]\n\nAt the time of Selena's death, 52% of all Latin music sales were generated by regional Mexican music. Most of this was Tejano, which had become one of the most popular Latin music genres.[179] Selena's music led the genre's 1990s revival and made it marketable for the first time.[151][182] Many media outlets described her as the \"Queen of Tejano Music\".[nb 5] Major record companies including EMI Records, SBK Records, Warner Music Group, CBS Records, and Sony Music began signing Tejano artists to compete in the Latin music market.[191][192] Following Selena's death, the Tejano music market suffered and its popularity waned. Radio stations in the United States that played Tejano music switched to regional Mexican music, and by 1997, KQQK was the only radio station playing non-stop Tejano music.[179]\n\nBy the mid-2000s, radio stations in the United States no longer played Tejano music, large auditoria stopped hosting Tejano artists by 2007,[193] and major record companies abandoned their Tejano artists after 1995. Selena remains the best-selling Tejano artist of all time, and continues to outsell living Tejano artists.[191] She remains the only Tejano musician whose recordings continue to chart on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart.[nb 6] After her death, Tejano music was replaced with Latin pop as the most popular Latin music genre in the United States.[191]\n\nWithin hours of Selena's murder, record stores sold out of her albums; EMI Latin began pressing several million CDs and cassettes to meet the expected demand.[151] Gloria Ballesteros, a sales representative of Southwestern Wholesalers in San Antonio, told Billboard their inventory of 5,000 copies of Selena albums was sold out by the afternoon of her death.[151] Record stores ordering more copies of her recordings were told by EMI Latin representatives they would not be able to restock for a few days.[151] EMI Latin shipped 500,000 units of Selena's recordings to stores in the two weeks following her death.[152] Her song \"Fotos y Recuerdos\" was number four on the US Billboard Hot Latin Tracks chart the day she was killed; it peaked at number one on April 15, 1995.[151]\n\nSelena's singles \"No Me Queda Más\", \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\", \"Como la Flor\", and \"Amor Prohibido\", re-entered the Hot Latin Tracks and the Regional Mexican Airplay chart in the issue of Billboard magazine dated April 15, 1995.[151] Selena's 1994 album Amor Prohibido re-entered the Billboard 200 chart at number 92, representing a 520 percent increase in sales. 12,040 units sold the week Selena was murdered.[151] The following week, the album rose to number 32 with 28,238 units sold representing a 135 percent increase.[152]\n\nAmor Prohibido, which was positioned at number four on March 31, peaked at number one on the Top Latin Albums chart in the issue dated April 15, 1995.[151] Three albums, Entre a Mi Mundo (1992), Live! (1993), and 12 Super Éxitos (1994), re-entered the Top Latin Albums chart, while Selena's albums took chart positions one to four on the Regional Mexican Albums chart that same week.[151] Her albums sparked a buying frenzy for Regional music in Japan, Germany, and China.\n\nDreaming of You, the crossover album Selena was working on at the time of her death, was released in July 1995. On the day of its release, 175,000 copies were sold in the U.S.—a record for a female vocalist—and 331,000 copies sold in its first week.[199][200] Selena became the third female artist after Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey to sell over 300,000 units in one week.[201] It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first album by a Latino artist to do so.[202][203][204] Dreaming of You was the first posthumous album by a solo artist to debut at number one.[205] The recording was among the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, and was the best-selling debut by a female act.[206]\n\nDreaming of You joined five of Selena's studio albums on the Billboard 200 chart simultaneously, making her the first female artist in Billboard history to accomplish this feat.[207] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified it 59x platinum for sales of 3.54 million album-equivalent units in the U.S.[208][209] As of October 2017 , it has sold over 2.942 million copies in the United States, becoming the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the country according to Nielsen SoundScan.[210] As of 2015, the recording has sold five million copies worldwide.[211]\n\nFive of Selena's albums generated $4 million in sales within five years. Selena was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame,[213] the Hard Rock Cafe's Hall of Fame in 1995, the South Texas Music Hall of Fame, and the Tejano Music Hall of Fame in 2001. In December 1999, she was named the \"top Latin artist of the '90s\" and \"best-selling Latin artist of the decade\" by Billboard for her fourteen top-ten singles—including seven number-one hits—in the Top Latin Songs chart.[217]\n\nOn the day Selena was killed, vigils and memorials were held throughout Texas and California. In San Antonio, radio station Tejano 107 sponsored a candlelight vigil at the Sunken Gardens, while KRIO-FM sponsored another at South Park Mall on March 31 which was attended by 5,000 people. Radio stations in Texas played her music non-stop.[58] On April 1, Bayfront Plaza in Corpus Christi held a vigil which drew 3,000 fans.[219] During the event, it was announced that a public viewing of the casket would be held at the Bayfront Auditorium the following day. Fans lined up for almost a mile (1500 m).\n\nAn hour before the doors opened, rumors that the casket was empty began circulating, which prompted the Quintanilla family to have an open-casket viewing.[220] About 30,000 to 40,000 fans passed by Selena's casket.[220][221][222] More than 78,000 signed a book of condolence. Flowers for the casket viewing were imported from The Netherlands.[224] At the request of Selena's family, video and flash photography were banned.[224] The same day, an unannounced bilingual Sunday morning Mass for Selena featuring a mariachi choir was held at the San Fernando Cathedral in downtown San Antonio. In the United States, many churches with a high proportion of Latino worshippers held prayers for Selena.\n\nA reporter noticed that many \"mythic symbols\" such as the Christian symbols of angels, saints, healers, and saviors, were \"attached to Selena\" by fans. There was a tribute for the singer during a St. Patrick's Day celebration in a Catholic church in Houston, Texas. Fr Sal DeGeorge decided to hold a tribute to Selena that day after people—especially children—asked him what was being planned for the singer. That same day, a disc jockey played Selena's music near the church in a small park.[227]\n\nOn April 3, 1995, six hundred guests—mostly family members—attended Selena's burial at Seaside Memorial Park, which was broadcast live by a Corpus Christi and San Antonio radio station without the consent of her family. A Jehovah's Witness minister from Lake Jackson preached in English, quoting Paul the Apostle's words in 1 Corinthians 15. Hundreds of people began circling the area in their vehicles. Among the celebrities who attended the funeral were Roberto Pulido, Bobby Pulido, David Lee Garza, Navaira, Laura Canales, Elsa Garcia, La Mafia, Ram Herrera, Imagen Latina, and Pete Astudillo.[229]\n\nA special Mass held the same day at Los Angeles Sports Arena drew a crowd of 4,000.[230] Selena had been booked to play there that night for her Amor Prohibido Tour. The promoter charged an admission fee, which upset Quintanilla, Jr. Fr Modesto Lopez Portillo drove from El Salvador to Los Angeles to be the officiating priest for the gathering; the consul general of El Salvador attended as well.[230] In Lake Jackson, a thousand fans and friends of Selena gathered at the municipal park in neighboring Clute, where she had played at the Mosquito Festival in July 1994.[231] The next day, Our Lady of the Pillar, a church in Zaragoza, Spain, held a Mass for Selena which drew 450 people to the 225-seat church. In the weeks following her death, cars throughout Texas were seen with pictures of Selena painted on them.[227] On April 28, during a fireworks display for Buccaneer Days in Corpus Christi, the music was reworked to include \"Bidi Bidi Bom Bom\" in her memory. Selena Etc. boutiques became shrines to the singer as fans left balloons, flowers, pictures, and poems. Street murals of Selena were found across Texas after her death.[178]\n\nIn the months following Selena's death, an average of 12,000 people visited her grave site and the Days Inn motel where the shooting occurred. The motel's manager rearranged its room numbers so guests would not know in which room Selena had been shot. The singer became part of the Day of the Dead celebration.[178] In 1997, Selena was commemorated with a museum and a life-sized bronze statue, Mirador de la Flor, in Corpus Christi, which are visited by hundreds of fans each week.[234] Fans flocked to her statue and murals, seeing them as a symbols of self-identity, unionism, religious expression, resistance, self-expression, equality, liberation, passion, optimism, possibility, and \"encouragement and hope to the poor\".[178]\n\nMusicians used music to express their thoughts about Selena or recorded compositions as tributes to her. These included American country artist Tony Joe White,[235] Haitian singer-songwriter Wyclef Jean,[236] American Tejano artist Pete Astudillo, Puerto Rican group the Barrio Boyzz, Mexican American singer Graciela Beltran, American Tejano artist Jennifer Pena, American hip-hop singer Lil Ray, American Tejano artists Emilio Navaria, Bobby Pulido,[237] Cuban salsa singer Celia Cruz, Dominican salsa singer José Alberto \"El Canario\", Puerto Rican salsa singers Ray Sepulveda, Michael Stuart, Manny Manuel, Puerto Rican jazz singer Hilton Ruiz,[238] American singer Jenni Rivera,[239] Mexican singer Lupillo Rivera,[240] Venezuelan-born Spanish rock singer Mikel Erentxun,[241] Puerto Rican singer Tony Garcia,[242] and American rapper King L.[243]\n\nSelena's family and her former band Los Dinos held a tribute concert a week after the 10th anniversary of her murder on April 7, 2005. The concert, titled Selena ¡VIVE!, was broadcast live on Univision and achieved a 35.9 household rating.[127][244] It was the highest-rated and most-viewed Spanish-language television special in the history of American television.[211] It was the most-watched program—regardless of language—among adults ages 18 to 34 in Los Angeles, Chicago, and San Francisco; it tied for first in New York, beating that night's episode of Fox's American Idol.[127] Among Latino viewers, figures for Selena ¡VIVE! exceeded those for Super Bowl XLV between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers and the telenovela Soy Tu Dueña, during what was the \"most-watched NFL season ever among Latinos\".[245][246]\n\nIn January 2015, it was announced that a two-day annual event called Fiesta de la Flor would be held in Corpus Christi by the Corpus Christi Visitors Bureau as a tribute to Selena. Musical acts for the first annual event included Kumbia All-Starz, Chris Pérez, Los Lobos, Jay Perez, Little Joe y la Familia, Los Palominos, Stefani Montiel of Las 3 Divas, Girl in a Coma's Nina Diaz, Las Fenix, and The Voice competitor Clarissa Serna.[247][248][249] The event raised $13 million and was attended by 52,000 people, 72% of whom lived outside Corpus Christi. The event sparked interest from people in thirty-five U.S. states and five countries including Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador.[250]\n\nWithin twenty minutes of Saldívar's surrender, she was taken to the downtown police station in Corpus Christi and placed in an interrogation room with investigators Paul and Ray Rivera. Paul Rivera, who had investigated homicides since 1978, informed Saldívar of her right to an attorney, which she waived. When investigators surrounded Saldívar's truck, she had cried out, \"I can't believe I killed my best friend\".[252] Within hours, she was saying the shooting was accidental.[253] Saldívar's bail bond was initially set at $100,000, but District Attorney Carlos Valdez persuaded the presiding judge to raise it to $500,000.\n\nWhen bail was announced, fans asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Saldívar so they could kill her when she was released. In prison, she faced more death threats from other inmates. The Mexican Mafia, a dominant gang in the Texas penal system, reportedly placed a price on Saldívar's head and spread the word that anyone who committed the crime would be a hero.\n\nSaldívar's crime was punishable by up to ninety-nine years in prison and a $10,000 fine.[255] She was kept at Nueces County jail under a suicide watch before her trial.[220] The State of Texas had difficulty arranging defense counsel for Saldívar; a spokesperson said any lawyer defending her could face death threats.[256] Eventually, Saldívar was assigned a public defender named Douglas Tinker. Tinker's wife feared they would suffer from community retribution and urged him not to take the case. Arnold Garcia, a former district prosecutor, was appointed as co-counsel.[258]\n\nValdez, who lived a few blocks away from Selena's family, chose Mark Skurka as the lead prosecutor. Judge Mike Westergren presided over the case, which was moved to the Harris County Courthouse in Houston to ensure an impartial jury. According to the Chicago Tribune, the trial's publicity \"rivaled that of the O. J. Simpson proceedings.\" Westergren ordered that the trial would not be televised or taped, and limited the number of reporters in the courtroom, to avoid a \"repeat of the Simpson circus.\"[260]\n\nThe Tribune reported the division of interest in the trial between Latinos and white Americans. Donna Dickerson, a white American magazine publisher, told the Tribune she had no interest in the trial because of Selena's \"Latino background\", and said Mexican-Americans had not shown the same enthusiasm after the death of Elvis Presley.[260] Saldívar's trial was called the \"trial of the century\" and the most important trial to the Latino population,[178][262][263] and generated interest in Europe, South America, Australia and Japan.[140]\n\nSaldívar pleaded not guilty, continuing to insist the shooting was accidental. In his opening statement, Valdez said he believed Saldívar \"deliberately killed Selena\". Tinker said the shooting was accidental and denied rumors Saldívar wanted to be romantically involved with Selena.[260] On October 23, 1995, the jury deliberated for two hours before finding Saldívar guilty of murder.[264] She was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for thirty years.[265] On November 22, 1995, she arrived at the Gatesville Unit—now the Christina Crain Unit—in Gatesville, Texas, for processing.[266]\n\nAs of 2024 , Saldívar remains incarcerated in Gatesville at the Patrick O'Daniel Unit (formerly Mountain View Unit), which is operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. She will be eligible for parole on March 30, 2025.[267] Because of multiple internal death threats from incarcerated Selena fans, Saldívar was placed in isolation and spends 23 hours a day alone in her 9 by 6 feet (2.7 by 1.8 m) cell.[268] In 2002, under a judge's order, the gun used to kill Selena was destroyed and the pieces were thrown into Corpus Christi Bay.[269][270] Fans and historians disapproved of the decision to destroy the gun, saying the event was historical and the gun should have been preserved in a museum.[271]Selena Quintanilla: The Life and Legacy of the “Queen of Tejano Music”: We may earn commission from links on this page, but we only recommend products we back.\n\nSelena Quintanilla made her recording debut in the 1980s and became a best-selling artist in the Latin music scene with albums like Amor Prohibido and Live! The latter earned her the Grammy for Best Mexican-American Album in 1994, making her the first female Tejano artist to win the award. Tragically, just shy of her 24th birthday, Selena was murdered by her fan club’s president and business associate in March 1995. Her album Dreaming of You was released later that year and topped the Billboard 200 chart—the first predominantly Spanish-language album to do so. Jennifer Lopez portrayed the late singer in a 1997 biopic.\n\n🎵 Listen to her greatest hits or 🎥 watch Selena on Amazon.\n\nSelena Quintanilla, often known simply by her stage name Selena, was born on April 16, 1971, in Lake Jackson, Texas. Selena’s father, Abraham Quintanilla Jr., was a former musician. Her mother, Marcella Ofelia Samora, was a homemaker. The couple had two older children and eventually opened a restaurant.\n\nSelena grew up speaking English, but her father taught her to sing in Spanish so she could resonate with the Latino community. She learned the lyrics phonetically at first and, eventually, learned to speak Spanish fluently. She began performing as a child.\n\nAround the age of 10, Selena became the lead singer in her family’s band, Selena Y Los Dinos. The musical group started out playing weddings and clubs in their native Texas. Abraham managed and produced his family’s group, which also featured Selena’s brother, Abraham III (known professionally as “A.B.” Quintanilla III), on bass guitar and her sister, Suzette, on the drums. Their Tejano music style incorporated Mexican music, country, and western.\n\n\n\nThe Quintanilla family, with Selena as the lead singer, recorded seven albums together as Selena Y Los Dinos. Most were recorded under indie labels. Alpha and And the Winner Is… were produced by Manny Guerra of G.P. Productions, which specialized in Tejano music. Dulce Amor, with original songs written by her brother, brought Selena to the attention of the Latin music world.\n\nThe seven albums are:\n• The New Girl In Town (1985)\n• And the Winner Is... (1987)\n\nMusic executive José Behar, who had just opened the Latin division of EMI Records, watched Selena perform at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. Soon after the concert, he signed Selena as a solo artist to the EMI label. She released her self-titled album that year.\n\nHer brother, A.B., who later founded the Kumbia Kings and Kumbia All Starz, wrote many of her songs and was also her producer. Between 1989 and 1995, Selena released five studio albums and one live album. In 2022, her family backed a new album featuring old recordings that were never released. With more than 65 million albums sold, the “Queen of Tejano” remains one of the best-selling female Latin artists.\n\nPopular compilation albums of Selena’s music include 12 Super Exitos (1994) and All My Hits Todos Mis Exitos (1999). \n\n\n\nSelena saw seven songs hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs chart, with 14 more songs ranking in the top 10. “Tu Solo Tu” topped the chart for 10 weeks, and “Amor Prohibido” earned No. 1 for nine weeks. “No Me Queda Mas,” “Fotos Y Recuerdos (Back On The Chain Gang),” and “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom” were among Selena’s other hits that led the Hot Latin Songs chart.\n\nArguably Selena’s most successful song, “Dreaming of You” peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nOther popular songs by Selena include “Como La Flor,” “Baila Esta Cumbia,” “La Carcacha,” “El Chico del Apartamento 512,” “I Could Fall In Love,” and “Siempre Hace Frio.”\n\nAt the 1987 Tejano Music Awards, Selena won Best Female Vocalist of the Year and Performer of the Year. She was sometimes referred to as the “Mexican Madonna” for her sexy outfits and dance moves. Eventually, her talents were recognized by more than just Tejano music fans.\n\nIn 1993, Selena won a Grammy for Best Mexican-American Album for her album Live! She was posthumously awarded the Recording Academy’s Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2021 Grammy Awards.\n\nBecause of her broad appeal to Latin audiences, Coca-Cola chose Selena as a spokesperson in 1989. Her appearance in ads for Coke was a marketing industry first: an advertiser targeting a specific demographic.\n\nExpanding her personal brand beyond her music career, in 1994, Selena opened two boutiques called Selena Etc., where she sold her signature line of clothing and jewelry. The stores were located in San Antonio and Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nShe also had a brief career as an actor, appearing as a mariachi singer in the 1995 movie Don Juan DeMarco, also starring Johnny Depp.\n\nSelena married Chris Pérez on April 2, 1992. The couple met and began secretly dating in 1990 when Pérez joined Selena’s band as the lead guitarist. They were married for nearly three years before Selena was killed in 1995.\n\nPérez wrote a book about his time with Selena, To Selena, With Love, published in 2012. He planned to make the book into a TV series. Then, in 2016, Abraham brought a lawsuit against Pérez for violating an estate agreement that Pérez signed shortly after the singer’s death that gave her father the exclusive rights to Selena’s name, voice, photographs, and story in perpetuity. Pérez lost his appeal in late 2018, and both sides agreed to dismiss the lawsuit the following May.\n\nSelena was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar in Corpus Christi, Texas, on March 31, 1995. She was 23 years old. Selena’s murder sent shockwaves through the Latino community, and her fans around the world mourned the singer’s passing.\n\nAfter attending one of Selena’s concerts, Saldívar encouraged Abraham to create a fan club for his daughter. The former nurse, who became the club’s president, had also been managing Selena’s boutique in San Antonio. The two were meeting in a hotel room to discuss Selena’s concerns that Saldívar was embezzling money, according to court records, when Saldívar, 34, shot Selena. Saldívar surrendered to the police later that day.\n\nDuring her October 1995 trial, Saldívar claimed the shot was accidental, but she was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. Currently, she is serving time in a maximum-security prison outside of Dallas. Saldívar is up for parole in 2025, which will be 30 years after Selena’s death.\n\nSelena’s life story became the subject of the 1997 movie Selena, which stars Jennifer Lopez as the Tejano superstar and Edward James Olmos as her father. Lopez became the first Latina actor to take home $1 million for a movie role, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. The movie was re-released in theaters in April 2022 to mark its 25th anniversary.\n\nDecades later, Netflix announced it was developing a scripted series about the singer’s life, with the Quintanilla family serving as executive producers. Selena: The Series, starring The Walking Dead’s Christian Serratos, debuted in December 2020.\n\nSelena’s music and persona has endured through the years, with honorary holidays, posthumous awards, a museum, and even a college course.\n\nTwo weeks after her death in 1995, then–Texas Governor George W. Bush declared the singer’s April 16th birthday “Selena Day.”\n\nThe Selena Museum, opened in 1998 by the Quintanilla family in Corpus Christi, Texas, honors Selena’s life and legacy. A collection of the late performer’s personal items, such as her wardrobe, awards and memorabilia, a recreation of her recording studio, her red Porsche, and her tour bus are on display.\n\nShe was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in November 2017. That year, reality star Kim Kardashian also dressed up as the Tejano singer as part of her homage to music legends for Halloween. In March 2020, Selena became the first Latina artist and the ninth person overall to be inducted into the Star Trail of Fame outside the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.\n\nThe 25th anniversary of Selena’s death in 2020 brought more remembrances and proved the popularity of her music hasn’t waned. Contemporary artists like Casey Musgraves and Camila Cabello covered Selena in concerts that year. Elsewhere, MAC Cosmetics released a limited-edition “MAC Cosmetics x Selena La Reina” collection in April, featuring a range of products, including Selena’s signature red lipstick, with shade names derived from her song lyrics. Their first Selena collection, in 2016, sold out within minutes.\n\nSelena was known as much for her onstage style as her songs, and in 2022, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History added the black leather jacket and satin bustier she wore at the 1994 Tejano Music Awards to their “Entertainment Nation”/“Nación del espectáculo” exhibit.\n• If you try to come off as this big-time star with an attitude, people don’t like that.\n• Saying that you’re a star is like saying you’re a freak.\n• I didn’t even start taking this seriously until I was older, when I was about 15, when I was actually winning the awards.\n• When love hits you, it hits you, and you don’t expect it.\n• I’m not one to say this is where I want to be in five years, because each day is different.

It is sung in Spanish and is rooted in the Hispanic community in South Texas. Fans dubbed Selena the Queen of Tejano and the Latin Madonna, the latter referring to the famed pop star. She was poised to achieve crossover success with the release of her first English-language album before she was tragically murdered.\n\nSelena Quintanilla was born the youngest of three children to Abraham, Jr., and Marcela Quintanilla in Lake Jackson, Texas. She began singing as a child, and, when Quintanilla was nine years old, her father formed a family band called Selena y Los Dinos. Her sister, Suzette, played drums and her brother, Abraham III (“A.B.”), played bass guitar. Her father wrote many of the Spanish-language songs that the group performed in the family’s restaurant. At that time Selena was not fluent in Spanish, so she had to learn the language. Los Dinos traveled throughout Texas to perform, usually as the opening act for Tejano bands. Because of the band’s popularity, Quintanilla stopped attending school in eighth grade, but she later earned a General Educational Development (GED) credential. The band recorded its first album, Mis Primeras Grabaciones (“My First Recordings”), in 1984, followed by the albums Alpha and Muñequito de Trapo (“Rag Doll”) two years later. In 1986, when Quintanilla was 15 years old, she won female entertainer of the year at the Tejano Music Awards, and her songs with Los Dinos began soaring on Latin music charts.\n\nIn 1989 Quintanilla signed a contract with EMI Latin, with whom she released her debut solo album, Selena, that same year. Several albums followed, including Ven Conmigo (1990; “Come with Me”) and Entre a Mi Mundo (1992; “Enter My World”). Her pop duet single, “Buenos Amigos” (“Good Friends”), with Salvadoran singer Álvaro Torres introduced her to a broader audience. In 1992 Selena married Chris Pérez, the lead guitarist of Los Dinos. With Selena Live! (1993), Selena won the 1994 Grammy Award for best Mexican-American album, becoming the first female Tejano singer to win a Grammy in that category. Her expanding interests in 1994 included beginning a clothing line and opening two boutiques. That same year she released the album Amor Prohibido (“Forbidden Love”), featuring the popular songs “Amor Prohibido” and “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom.” The album was nominated for a 1995 Grammy Award for best Mexican-American performance. Selena was working on her first English-language album when she was shot by the founder of her fan club, Yolanda Saldívar, who was suspected of embezzlement and whom Selena confronted about the improprieties. Selena died hours later in a hospital in Corpus Christi.\n\nThe album Dreaming of You (1995) was released a few months after Selena’s death and includes several completed English songs as well as previously recorded and new Tejano songs. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, the first album by a Latina artist to achieve that goal.

Mitsotakis has been president of the New Democracy party since 2016. He is generally associated with the centre-right, espousing economically liberal policies.\n\nMitsotakis previously was Leader of the Opposition from 2016 to 2019, and Minister of Administrative Reform from 2013 to 2015. He is the son of the late Konstantinos Mitsotakis, who was Prime Minister of Greece from 1990 to 1993. He was first elected to the Hellenic Parliament for the Athens B constituency in 2004. After New Democracy suffered two election defeats in 2015, he was elected the party's leader in January 2016. Three years later, he led his party to a majority in the 2019 Greek legislative election.\n\nFollowing the May 2023 Greek legislative election in which no party won a majority and no coalition government was formed by any of the parties eligible to do so, Mitsotakis called for a snap election in June. On 24 May 2023, as required by Greece's constitution, the Greek president Katerina Sakellaropoulou appointed Ioannis Sarmas to be the caretaker prime minister for the interim period.[1] In the June 2023 Greek legislative election, he once again led his party to a majority and was sworn in as prime minister, having received the order to form a government from the Greek president.[2][3][4][5]\n\nDuring his terms as Prime Minister, Mitsotakis has received both praise and criticism for his pro-European, technocratic governance, austerity measures,[6] and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in Greece.[7][8] He has been credited with the modernization and digital transformation of the country's public administration,[9] and has been remarked for his overall management of the Greek economy, with Greece being named the Top Economic Performer for 2022 by The Economist,[10] which was in particular due to Greece in 2022 being able to repay ahead of schedule 2.7 billion euros ($2.87 billion) of loans owed to Eurozone countries under the first bailout it received during its decade-long debt crisis, along with being on the verge of reaching investment-grade rating.[11][12] He has been commended for furthering LGBT rights in Greece through the legalization of same-sex adoption and same-sex marriage in Greece.[13][14] He has also received both praise and criticism for his handling of migration, including aid from the European Union,[15] but criticism from journalists and activists for pushbacks, which his government has denied.[16] Additionally, Mitsotakis has received criticism for heightened corruption during his term,[17][18] as well as a deterioration of freedom of the press in Greece.[19][20][21] His term was impacted by the 2022 wiretapping scandal,[22] the Tempi Train crash,[23] and the wildfires in 2021 and 2023.[24][25][26] In 2024 he received criticism by the European Parliament in a resolution addressing concerns over the state of the rule of law in Greece.[27][28][29]\n\nKyriakos Mitsotakis was born in Athens on 4 March 1968, the son of Marika (née Giannoukou) and former Greek prime minister and New Democracy president Konstantinos Mitsotakis. At the time of his birth, his family had been placed under house arrest by the Greek military junta that had declared his father persona non grata and imprisoned him on the night of the coup.[30] In 1968, when he was six months old, the family escaped to Turkey with the help of Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs İhsan Sabri Çağlayangil. After a while, they moved from Turkey to Paris and returned to Greece in 1973.[31] Mitsotakis controversially described the first six months of his life as political imprisonment.[32][33]\n\nIn 1986, Mitsotakis graduated from Athens College. From 1986 to 1990, he attended Harvard University and earned a bachelor's degree in social studies, receiving the Hoopes Prize. Later, his senior thesis was published as a book titled The Pitfalls of Foreign Policy, which received mixed reviews.[34][35] From 1992 to 1993, he attended Stanford University, earning a Ford Dorsey Master's in International Policy. From 1993 to 1995, he attended Harvard Business School, where he earned an MBA.[36]\n\nFrom 1990 to 1991 Kyriakos Mitsotakis worked as a financial analyst at the corporate finance division of Chase Bank in London. From 1991 to 1992, Mitsotakis returned to Greece and joined the Hellenic Army to fulfil his mandatory national service obligations. From 1995 to 1997, and following the completion of his post-graduate studies, he was employed by the consultancy McKinsey & Company in London, focusing primarily on the telecommunications and financial services industries. From 1997 to 1999 he worked for Alpha Ventures, a private equity subsidiary of Alpha Bank, as a senior investment officer, executing venture capital and private equity transactions. In 1999 he founded NBG Venture Capital, the private equity and venture capital subsidiary of the National Bank of Greece, and acted as its CEO, managing its portfolio and executing transactions in Greece and the Balkans, until April 2003, when he resigned to pursue a career in politics.[36]\n\nIn January 2003, he was nominated by the World Economic Forum as a global leader of tomorrow.[37]\n\nDuring the 2000 legislative election, Mitsotakis worked for New Democracy's national campaign. In the 2004 legislative election, Mitsotakis ran in the Athens B constituency, receiving more votes than any other New Democracy candidate in the country and was elected to the Hellenic Parliament.[citation needed]\n\nMitsotakis is honorary president of Konstantinos K. Mitsotakis Foundation, aiming at promoting the life and works of Konstantinos Mitsotakis and at reporting the modern political history of Greece.[citation needed]\n\nOn 24 June 2013, Mitsotakis was appointed as the Minister of Administrative Reform and e-Governance in Antonis Samaras' cabinet, succeeding Antonis Manitakis. He was in this position until January 2015. During this time, he pursued comprehensive national reforms by implementing a functional reorganization of institutions, structures and processes. He steadfastly supported the drastic downsizing of the Public Sector and the structural reform of the tax administration.\n\nIn 2015, Mitsotakis was a parliamentary representative for New Democracy, representing the President of the party in Parliament, as well as the body of the party's Representatives. He was charged with expressing the positions of his party during Parliamentary procedures and discourse, as well as ensuring the proper function of Parliament through a process of checks and balances. In March 2015, he claimed that then-Minister of Finance Yanis Varoufakis was undermining the Greek negotiations over the third bailout programme, saying: \"Every time he opens his mouth, he creates a problem for the country's negotiating position.\"[38]\n\nMitsotakis was the first of four New Democracy members to announce their candidacy in the leadership election, declared following the resignation of Antonis Samaras as party leader and the failure of New Democracy in the September 2015 snap election.[39] Amongst the other contestants was then-interim leader and former Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament Vangelis Meimarakis. According to the Financial Times, Mitsotakis was \"billed as an outsider in the leadership race\" due to the party establishment's support of Meimarakis' candidacy.[40] Following the first round of voting with no clear winner, Mitsotakis came second, 11% behind Meimarakis.[40]\n\nOn 10 January 2016, Mitsotakis was elected president of the New Democracy political party succeeding Ioannis Plakiotakis (transitional president) with almost 4% difference from opponent Vangelis Meimarakis. A week following Mitsotakis' election as leader, two opinion polls were published that put New Democracy ahead of Syriza for the first time in a year.[41]\n\nHis party won 33% of the votes in the European elections in 2019.[42] He managed to win back votes from the Golden Dawn Party.[43] Following the election results, the Hellenic Parliament was dissolved and a snap election was called.[44]\n\nUnder Mitsotakis, Greece has declined in press freedom. Violence against journalists has increased,[45] resulting to a deterioration of the Greek freedom of the press.[46][47][48] Mitsotakis' government has directed funds towards media platforms that produce favorable coverage, whilst also allocating more than €20 million to state-friendly media at the beginning of the pandemic.[46] Furthermore, in November 2021, the government enacted a law to criminalize the dissemination of \"fake news\". This legislation empowers authorities to imprison individuals for up to five years if they spread purportedly false information that is deemed capable of causing concern or fear to the public or undermining public confidence in the national economy, the country's defense capacity, or public health.[49][50] Mitsotakis has acknowledged that the law may have been a mistake, but the law has not been reversed.[46]\n\nMitsotakis adopted a hardline stance on the European Migrant Crisis by resorting to pushbacks of thousands of migrants in an attempt to prevent their entry into Greece, which his government has denied.[51][52][53] He received praise from the European Union for his handling of the crisis and received economic support of €700m.[54]\n\nIn July 2022, the leader of the political party PASOK, Nikos Androulakis, revealed that there was an attempt of bugging his phone with the spyware program \"Predator\". In a closed-door parliamentary hearing that was called by Androulakis, the chief of Greek Intelligence Service, P. Kontoleon, admitted that his service had spied Greek journalist Thanassis Koukakis, who has also complained about being targeted by \"Predator\".[55] After the publication of an investigation by Efsyn and Reporters United that Grigoris Dimitriadis, Mitsotakis's nephew and general secretary, had connections with Felix Bitsios, the owner of the company that markets the \"Predator\", Dimitriadis submitted his resignation.[56] Shortly after, the chief of Greek Intelligence Service, Panagiotis Kontoleon, also stepped down over an allegation that his service had tapped Androulakis's phone.[55] Mitsotakis himself has actively worked to block any investigation on the wiretapping scandal from concluding.[57][58] The scandal has garnered extensive attention in the international media due to the fact that a number of the actions taken subsequent to the revelations were contentious and seemed to suggest an attempt to conceal the truth.[59][60][61] In January 2023, despite calls from the opposition to hold the government accountable for its actions and investigate the scandal further, Mitsotakis' administration successfully withstood a no-confidence vote.[62]\n\nOn 28 February 2023, a freight train and a passenger train traveling in opposite directions between Athens and Thessaloniki were inadvertently routed on the same track; 57 people were killed in the head-on collision near Tempi. Amid rising anger and nationwide protests, Mitsotakis offered \"a public apology on behalf of those who ruled the country over the years\", took responsibility for the disaster and vowed to fix the long-neglected rail system.[63][64] He said the government would invest more than 270 million Euros to hire more staff and to install digital control systems by August.[65]\n\nIn December 2020, Mitsotakis was criticized after a photo of him surfaced on social media, in which he posed with five other people while not wearing a mask, during a time when Greece had a nationwide lockdown and mask-wearing was mandatory both indoors and outdoors.[66][67] On 6 February 2021 Mitsotakis visited the island of Icaria to inspect the progress of COVID-19 vaccinations in the area. During this visit, he attended a lunch organized by MP Christodoulos I. Stefanadis along with his entourage numbering up to 40 people. The incident was covered by both Greek and international media and Mitsotakis was heavily criticized for violating the existing COVID-19 containment measures.[68][69][70][71] Mitsotakis publicly apologized for the Icaria incident, saying this will never happen again and that \"the image hurt the citizens\".[72][73]\n\nIn May 2021, when the Mitsotakis government announced the country's opening for tourism on 14 May, movement control measures, such as the obligation to send an SMS at particular sites, were retained temporarily. Other measures still in place after the re-opening of tourism were the daily curfew, from 00:30, the obligatory use of face masks indoors and outdoors, the ban on music in cafes and restaurants, and the ban on the operation of indoor restaurants throughout May. Casinos were allowed to operate, with a specific sanitary protocol. In an interview on 27 May 2021, Mitsotakis did not give a clear answer as to when and if the above measures would be lifted in the summer. He referred to a roadmap for lifting the controls but did not elaborate. He also estimated that tourism in 2021 in Greece would be around 50% of the levels experienced in 2019.[74][75][76][77] Greece was awarded the \"Global Champion Award for COVID-19 Crisis Management\" by the World Travel and Tourism Council, which \"commends\" the Greek Government as \"a global example for the safe opening of the tourism sector during the pandemic.\"[78][79] He was also credited for the vaccine pass which was later used in the majority of countries in the European Union.[80]\n\nNew Democracy was victorious in the 2019 legislative election, scoring 39.85% of votes and securing 158 seats in the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nOn 8 July 2019, Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos accepted Tsipras' resignation and tasked Mitsotakis with forming a new government.[81] Mitsotakis was sworn in as prime minister the same day as well.[82][83] On 9 July, the ministers in his government were sworn in. Among his cabinet was Makis Voridis, a former member of the far-right Popular Orthodox Rally, who was met with a cold reception abroad and by the Jewish community in Greece. Israel announced that it would not cooperate with Voridis.[84]\n\nFrom 2019 onwards, it is launching a wave of privatizations, including tourism infrastructure, coastal land, and state-owned shares in the gas and electricity companies and Athens airport. On the other hand, a tax reform aimed at making the country \"a haven for billionaires and the wealthiest citizens\", the Financial Times notes, is being implemented. The aim is to attract investment by offering low tax rates. A clause will protect the beneficiaries of this tax policy from possible policy changes by future governments.[85]\n\nThe \"big growth bill\", adopted in the summer of 2020, provides for the restriction of the right to strike and the abolition of collective agreements, which had already been suspended in 2012 at the request of the Troika and then reinstated by the Tsipras government. Migration policy has been tightened: the coverage of hospital care for destitute foreigners has been abolished and the period during which refugees who have been granted asylum can reside in public housing has been reduced from six months to one month.[86] On environmental issues, the government reformed legislation to facilitate oil exploration.[87]\n\nMitsotakis' government has been praised by some observers for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as for its plans for spending a €31bn share of the EU's Recovery Plan and for its orderly vaccination roll-out. Additionally, the common COVID-19 certificate was credited to Mitsotakis, and his idea has been taken up at a European level.[88][89] Mitsotakis had criticized the initially slow pace of the EU's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, and he had called for its acceleration.[90]\n\nMeasures were implemented from March to May 2020 and from November 2020 until May 2021, when their gradual lifting started. The controls included the introduction of various movement restrictions, suspension of the operation of retail, catering and entertainment businesses, as well as schools and churches.[91][92]\n\nIn August 2020, a reform of the labour law was adopted. It provides for the possibility of an employer to dismiss employees without having to give reasons for the decision or give prior notice to the persons concerned. The tax authorities' anti-fraud unit was abolished and its employees were integrated into the Ministry of Finance.[93]\n\nThere is a long-standing dispute between Turkey and Greece over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Mitsotakis said that Turkey \"remains stuck in the logic of using force and threats.\"[94] He told NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that Greece is \"contributing to NATO, we are an ally and have the expectation that when another NATO ally is behaving in a way that jeopardises our interests, NATO should not adopt this stance of equal distances and non-intervention in internal differences. It is deeply unfair to Greece.\"[95]\n\nIn July 2020, Mitsotakis awarded honorary Greek citizenship to American actor Tom Hanks and his wife, American actress Rita Wilson, the latter of whom is half Greek.[96]\n\nOn 16 May 2022, Mitsotakis met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House.[97] On the next day, Mitsotakis became the first Prime Minister of Greece to address a Joint session of the United States Congress at the invitation of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.[98][99][100][101]\n\nDuring his term as PM, Mitsotakis has received both praise and criticism for his pro-European, technocratic governance, austerity measures,[80] and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.[102][103] Greece was named the Top Economic Performer for 2022 by The Economist,[104] in particular because Greece in 2022 repaid ahead of schedule 2.7 billion euros ($2.87 billion) of loans owed to Eurozone countries under the first bailout it received during its decade-long debt crisis, and also because of being on the verge of reaching investment-grade rating.[105][106] Mitsotakis has also received criticism on the subject of corruption, as during his term, Greece has experienced heightened corruption,[107][33] and a deterioration of freedom of the press.[46][47][48] His term was also marred by the Novartis corruption scandal,[108][109] the 2022 wiretapping scandal,[22] and the Tempi Train crash.[23] In addition, he has received both praise and criticism for his handling of migration, receiving praise and aid from the European Union,[54] but criticism from journalists and activists for pushbacks, which his government has denied.[110]\n\nMitsotakis visited President Katerina Sakellaropoulou on 22 April in order to request the dissolution of the Parliament due to a national issue of extraordinary importance (pursuant to Article 41 of the Constitution of Greece); the issue cited was the need of political stability for the achievement of investment-grade.[111][112] The election day was set for Sunday 21 May,[112] a day before the end of the 30-day period within which elections must be held following the dissolution of the Parliament.\n\nNew Democracy won the plurality of votes but did not win an outright majority. As no coalition government was formed by any of the parties eligible to do so, Mitsotakis called for another snap election in June.[113][114][115] On 24 May, as required by Greece's constitution, President Sakellaropoulou appointed Ioannis Sarmas to be the caretaker prime minister for the interim.[116]\n\nThe next month, he once again led his party to a majority in the June 2023 Greek legislative election and was sworn in as prime minister again after receiving the order to form a government by the president.[117][118][119]\n\nIn July 2023, Mitsotakis announced that he intended to legalise same-sex marriage in Greece.[120] On 17 September, Mitsotakis stated that the subject would be addressed in Greece within the next four years.[121]\n\nIn October 2023, Mitsotakis condemned the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel and expressed his support to Israel and \"its right to self-defense\".[122] Greece agreed to participate in the next steps towards supporting NATO operations in the region, but later backed a ceasefire call through the United Nations.[123]\n\nIn 2024, his tenure continued with the introduction of landmark bills, focusing on the establishment of private academic institutions in Greece,[124] as well as revisions to the tax and income systems.[125] Additionally, legislation was proposed for same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, a move that was widely described as progressive.[126][127] However, these initiatives faced significant opposition from right-wing and hard-right factions within the party,[128] as well as the Greek Orthodox church,[129] who openly expressed their disagreement with the proposed legislation.[130] To address these concerns and secure support ahead of the parliamentary vote, Mitsotakis took the unconventional step of organizing educational meetings for dissenting members, aiming to provide a detailed explanation of the potential benefits of the proposed bills for same-sex couples.[131] According to journalistic sources, the educational initiative was not successful.[132]\n\nPrior to the government's plans to legalize private higher education systems, it came under criticism for allegedly violating Article 16 of the constitution.[133] Legal experts and other political parties argued that the government was circumventing the constitution by introducing private institutions without first amending the constitution.[134][135] Some contended that amending the constitution was unfeasible due to the government's insufficient number of MPs in parliament.[136] Mitsotakis's approach was viewed as a shortcut, which was widely considered unconstitutional, resulting in widespread protests against private institutions.[137][138][139]\n\nDuring a working visit to Ukraine on 6 March 2024 to meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, a Russian missile exploded near his entourage, killing five people.[140][141]\n\nIn the 2024 European Parliament election, his party fell in popular support to 28%, compared to nearly 41% in the June 2023 legislative election; this was capitalized by centre-left parties (Syriza, PASOK) proposing a joint opposition against him in the next Greek legislative election.[142]\n\nThe leaders discussed Middle East and Ukraine developments, reviewed bilateral relations, and agreed on enhancing trade and cooperation. They planned to meet again in September in New York. The Prime Minister emphasized resolving the Cyprus issue, highlighting its prolonged division.[143]\n\nMitsotakis is the younger brother of former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mayor of Athens Dora Bakoyannis, making him the brother-in-law of the late Pavlos Bakoyannis, who was assassinated by the terrorist group 17 November in 1989 and the uncle of Kostas Bakoyannis,[144] former Regional Governor of Central Greece and former Mayor of Athens.\n\nMitsotakis is married to Mareva Grabowska, an investment banker with British, Greek, Polish and Egyptian roots. They have three children, Sophia, Konstantinos and Daphne.[145]\n\nIn addition to Greek, Mitsotakis speaks English, French and some German.[146]\n\nThis page incorporates information from the Hellenic Parliament website\n• CV and office terms of Kyriakos Mitsotakis at the Hellenic ParliamentKyriakos Mitsotakis | Biography, Policies,& Facts | Britannica: Kyriakos Mitsotakis (born March 4, 1968, Athens, Greece) is a Greek politician and scion of one of Greece’s most prominent political families who became prime minister of Greece in July 2019 at the head of a New Democracy (ND) government. His father, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, had served as prime minister from 1990 to 1993. His sister, Dora Bakoyannis, had been the mayor of Athens when it hosted the 2004 Olympic Games, and her son, Costas Bakoyannis (Mitsotakis’s nephew), became mayor of Athens in 2019. Moreover, Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s grandfather and great-grandfather were members of the Greek parliament, and the most prominent Greek politician and statesman of the early 20th century, Eleuthérios Venizélos, was his granduncle.\n\nKyriakos Mitsotakis is the youngest of Konstantinos Mitsotakis’s four children. In 1967, shortly before Kyriakos was born, his father was arrested as part of the military takeover of the Greek government. Mitsotakis père then fled with his family to Paris. They did not return to Greece until 1973. Konstantinos restarted his political career in 1974 after the fall of the military government and Konstantinos eventually joined the centre-right New Democracy party, becoming its leader in 1984 and the prime minister in 1990. Against this backdrop, Kyriakos attended the Athens College preparatory school and matriculated to Harvard University, from which he graduated summa cum laude in 1990 with a bachelor’s degree in social sciences. While at Harvard he was awarded the Tocqueville and Hoopes prizes for his undergraduate thesis exploring the foreign policy of the U.S. government toward Greece. Mitsotakis continued his formal education at Stanford University, where he focused on issues related to European integration en route to earning a master’s degree in international relations in 1993. He then returned to Harvard and was awarded an MBA in 1995. Following the completion of his studies, Mitsotakis took a position as a financial analyst with Chase Investment Bank in London (1990–91). He also worked as consultant with McKinsey and Company (1995–97), advising clients primarily in the financial services and telecommunications industries, before returning to Greece and becoming a senior investment officer with Alpha Ventures (1997–99). Two years later he switched employers again, this time assuming the role of chief executive officer of NBG Venture Capital for the National Bank of Greece. In that capacity he was recognized as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the 2003 World Economic Forum.\n\nIn 2003 Mitsotakis entered politics, and the following year he won election to the parliament as a member of ND. He would win reelection in 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2015. During his tenure he served on the Defense and Foreign Affairs committee, European Affairs committee, Finance committee, Production and Trade committee, and Constitution Revision committee. From 2007 to 2009 he chaired the Environment committee. In June 2013 he was appointed minister of administrative reform and e-governance in the administration of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and retained that portfolio until the fall of the Samaras government in January 2015. As minister, Mitsotakis responded to the debt crisis that had forced the Greek government to seek a financial bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund by implementing a widespread reorganization of government institutions and processes. He also oversaw dramatic reductions in the public service workforce and restructuring of the tax administration.\n\nLeader of New Democracy and prime minister of Greece After the Greek electorate turned to the Syriza party and elevated Alexis Tsipras to the premiership, Mitsotakis sought the leadership of ND. As an advocate of LGBT rights and of a relatively lenient approach to the handling of Europe’s migrant crisis, Mitsotakis faced an uphill battle against those in his party who traditionally opposed gay rights and took a hard line on immigration. His support of private enterprise also ran up against opposition from those in ND who favoured government intervention in the economy. Nonetheless, Mitsotakis, who cast himself as a liberal reformer, was committed to broadening the appeal of his party by moving it from its traditional right-wing stance toward the centre. Ultimately, he triumphed over Evangelos Meimarakis in the leadership battle and became ND leader in January 2016. In his ascent to the leadership, Mitsotakis sought to make a name for himself rather than simply leverage his famous family’s political legacy. “Judge me by CV, not by my name,” he asked. Mitsotakis also cast himself as something of an unconventional Greek politician. Greek political culture is frequently suffused with hypermasculinity, and Mitsotakis unashamedly went against the grain by wearing a lucky charm bracelet and revealing himself to be a green tea drinker. Moreover, he and his wife, Mareva Grabowski-Mitsotaki, a former Deutsche Bank executive and cofounder of a clothing label, went through a separation that was atypically public for a Greek politician. After several years apart, they reconciled, and she was at Mitsotakis’s side, along with their three children, when he took to the hustings as ND leader. As leader of the opposition, Mitsotakis was a harsh critic of Tsipras’s stewardship of the economy. He also condemned the agreement that the prime minister struck that settled Greece’s long-standing dispute with what had been the Republic of Macedonia over that country’s name, which was officially changed to North Macedonia. Mitsotakis’s advocacy of privatization, his pledge to create jobs, and his promises to cut spending and taxes appeared to resonate with Greek voters, who presented ND with a decisive victory in the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. With the solvency of his government threatened by this result, Tsipras called for a snap parliamentary election to be held in early July. Mitsotakis, having engaged in strident partisan criticism of the government during most of his leadership of ND, shifted gears and struck a more conciliatory tone during the election campaign. Mindful that Tsipras had been unable to deliver on many of the bold promises that brought him to power, Mitsotakis was careful not to overpromise. When Greek voters went to the polls on July 7, they rewarded Mitsotakis by delivering nearly 40 percent of the vote to ND, compared with about 31.5 percent for Syriza. As a result, ND captured an absolute majority in the parliament, with 158 seats, and Mitsotakis became prime minister.\n\nAt the top of the list of challenges faced by Mitsotakis early in his tenure was combating the COVID-19 global pandemic, which reached Greece in late February 2020. Aware that the Greek health care system had been compromised by austerity cuts, the government sought to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the pandemic by quickly imposing travel restrictions and lockdown measures. Consequently, Greece fared better than many other EU countries during the first wave of the pandemic. However, because the government was slower in responding to later waves of the contagion, the country suffered more during the surges in late 2021 and in 2022. Nevertheless, partly as a result of financial support provided by the European Union during the health crisis and partly because of the return of tourists afterward, the Greek economy bounced back strongly from the impact of the pandemic. Indeed, GDP increased by more than 8 percent in 2021 and by nearly 6 percent in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund. Mitsotakis was quick to attribute that growth and the return of foreign investment to the tax cuts and support for private business that were the cornerstones of his economic policy. Arguably the greatest indicator of Greece’s return to economic stability (cast as an economic “miracle” in some quarters) was the reduction of debt as a percentage of GDP from more than 212 percent in 2020 to 166 percent in 2023. In the process, Greece reached the verge of reattaining investment-grade status in the world financial markets. As the May 2023 parliamentary elections approached, Mitsotakis and ND leaned hard into those positive economic developments while promising to cut taxes further, spark wage and salary increases, restructure the health care system, and improve infrastructure. The last pledge was especially significant in the wake of the national outrage that had greeted a head-on collision between a freight train and a passenger train in February 2023, resulting in 57 deaths (the deadliest train disaster in Greek history). Mitsotakis’s tenure in office had also been tainted by a scandal involving the Greek intelligence agency’s tapping in 2021 of the phones of at least one journalist and of PASOK leader Nikos Androulakis, among others (allegedly, the phones of more than 30 people had been tapped). Mitsotakis, who claimed to have been unaware of the operation, acknowledged that phone tapping should never have taken place but argued that it was not illegal.\n\nNotwithstanding that scandal, concerns about threats to the rule of law, and an escalating cost of living (due in large part to economic disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine War), Greek voters overwhelmingly endorsed the leadership of Mitsotakis by providing ND with more than 40 percent of the vote in the May elections, compared with about 20 percent for Syriza and less than 12 percent for PASOK. That victory translated into 146 ND seats in the 300-seat parliament, just short of an outright majority. Unwilling to settle for attempting to form a coalition government, Mitsotakis turned over the reigns of power to a caretaker government and set the stage for Greeks to vote again, in late June—this time with a rule in place that would allocate as many as 50 additional seats to the party receiving the most votes. When Greeks went back to the polls on June 25, once again they indicated their preference for Mitsotakis as prime minister, handing ND more than 40 percent of the vote, which was now good for a total of 158 seats in the parliament—a simple majority. Syriza and PASOK had to settle for about 18 percent and about 12 percent of the vote, respectively.Kyriákos Mitsotákis - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Kyriákos Mitsotákis (en griego: Κυριάκος Μητσοτάκης; Atenas, 4 de marzo de 1968) es un político griego, primer ministro de Grecia desde el 8 de julio de 2019. Previamente fue presidente del partido político Nueva Democracia desde 2016 y líder de la oposición. Ejerció como ministro de Reforma Administrativa y Gobierno Electrónico entre 2011 y 2015. También ejerce como diputado del Consejo de los Helenos desde 2004, por la circunscripción de Atenas B.\n\nNacido en Atenas, es hijo de Konstantínos Mitsotákis, ex primer ministro de Grecia y presidente honorario del partido político Nueva Democracia, y de su esposa, Marika Giannoukou.\n\nÉl y su familia tuvieron que mudarse a París en 1968, cuando tenía solo seis meses de edad, porque su padre había sido declarado persona non grata por la Dictadura de los Coroneles. La familia regresó cuando se llevó a cabo la transición a la democracia o Metapolítefsi en 1974. En 1986, asistió a la Athens College, finalizando el año con el título de salutatorian.\n\nEntre 1986 y 1990, cursó Estudios Sociales en la Universidad de Harvard en Cambridge, Massachusetts (Estados Unidos), donde se graduó con summa cum laude (alta distinción). También fue condecorado con el premio Hoopes.\n\nTrabajó como analista económico en el Chase Manhattan Bank de 1990 hasta 1991 en Londres. Posteriormente regresó a su país y se unió a la Fuerza Aérea Griega para cumplir su servicio militar.\n\nKyriákos regresó a los Estados Unidos, donde continuó con sus estudios en la Universidad de Stanford, en donde recibió su Licenciatura en Relaciones Internacionales. Continuó en su círculo de estudios y regresó a Harvard dónde se le otorgó su Maestría en Administración de Negocios.\n\nEntre 1995 y 1997, viajó a Londres y trabajó en la asesoría de McKinsey & Company. Después regresó nuevamente a Grecia, en donde comenzó a trabajar para Alpha Ventures, una filial de capital privado de Alpha Bank. Poco después, continuó trabajando como director gerente de NBG Venture Capital en el Banco Nacional de Grecia.\n\nDurante las elecciones parlamentarias de 2000, Mitsotakis trabajó para la campaña nacional de Nueva Democracia. En las elecciones parlamentarias de 2004, Mitsotakis se postuló como candidato por la circunscripción de Atenas B, recibiendo más votos que cualquier otro candidato de Nueva Democracia a nivel nacional, y fue elegido por el Consejo de los Helenos.\n\nMitsotakis es presidente honorario de la Fundación Constantinos K. Mitsotakis, que se destaca por promover la vida y obras de su padre e informar sobre la historia política moderna de Grecia.\n\nEl 24 de junio de 2013, Mitsotakis fue nombrado ministro de Reforma Administrativa y Gobierno Electrónico durante el gobierno de Antonis Samarás, sucediendo a Antonis Manitakis.\n\nEn 2015, Mitsotakis ejerció como vocero parlamentario de Nueva Democracia. En marzo de 2015, afirmó que el entonces ministro de Finanzas Yanis Varoufakis, estaba socavando las negociaciones griegas sobre el tercer programa de rescate, declarando «Cada vez que abre la boca, crea un problema para las negociaciones por el país».[1]​\n\nMitsotakis fue el primero de los cuatro diputados de Nueva Democracia en anunciar su candidatura para las elecciones de liderazgo del partido, luego de que Antonis Sámaras anunciara su renuncia como líder del partido y la derrota de Nueva Democracia en las elecciones parlamentarias de septiembre de 2015.[2]​ Entre los otros candidatos se encontraba el líder provisional y exvocero del Consejo de los Helenos Vangelis Meimarakis. Según el Financial Times, Mitsotakis «fue considerado como un candidato outsider en la carrera por el liderazgo» debido al inmenso apoyo que había hacia la candidatura de Meimarakis.[3]​ Tras la primera ronda de votos sin un claro ganador, Mitsotakis obtuvo el segundo lugar de la elección con un 11%, siendo superado solo por Meimarakis.\n\nEl 10 de enero de 2016, Mitsotakis fue elegido presidente de Nueva Democracia, sucediendo a Ioannis Plakiotakis (presidente de transición) con casi un 4% de diferencia en contra de su rival Vangelis Meimarakis. Una semana después de su elección, se publicaron dos encuestas de opinión que posicionaron por primera vez a Nueva Democracia por sobre el partido Syriza.[4]​\n\nSu partido obtuvo el 33% de los votos en las elecciones europeas de 2019. Hace campaña sobre cuestiones nacionalistas criticando el acuerdo de Prespa sobre el nombre de Macedonia y las políticas de acogida de los exiliados. En particular, consiguió recuperar votos del partido Amanecer Dorado.[5]​\n\nNueva Democracia obtuvo mayoría absoluta en las elecciones parlamentarias de 2019 con casi un 40% de los votos y 158 escaños, regresando al poder con Mitsotakis como nuevo primer ministro de Grecia.[6]​\n\nEl 8 de julio, al día siguiente de las elecciones legislativas, fue nombrado primer ministro por el presidente de la República, Prokópis Pavlópoulos. Su gobierno tomó posesión al día siguiente. A diferencia de su predecesor, Alexis Tsipras, optó por jurar sobre la Biblia y no sobre la Constitución. El nombramiento de personalidades del movimiento neofascista para dirigir ministerios fue recibido con frialdad en el extranjero y por la comunidad judía de Grecia. Israel anunció que no cooperaría con el ministro de Agricultura, Mavroudís Vorídis.[7]​\n\nEl 31 de agosto de 2021 incorporó a su Gobierno a otras tres personalidades de extrema derecha, lo que volvió a causar polémica. El nuevo ministro de Sanidad, Athanassios Plevris, había sido conocido en el pasado por hacer comentarios abiertamente antisemitas.[8]​\n\nEn agosto se aprobó una reforma de la legislación laboral. Prevé la posibilidad de que un empresario despida a sus empleados sin tener que motivar su decisión ni avisar previamente a los afectados. Se suprime la brigada antifraude de Hacienda y sus empleados se integran en el Ministerio de Hacienda.[9]​\n\nHa llevado a cabo una oleada de privatizaciones a partir de 2019, entre las que se encuentran las de infraestructuras turísticas, terrenos costeros y acciones estatales en empresas de gas y electricidad y en el aeropuerto de Atenas. El periódico Financial Times señala que se está llevando a cabo una reforma fiscal para convertir al país en \"un paraíso para multimillonarios y ciudadanos ricos\" ofreciendo tipos impositivos bajos. Una cláusula protegerá a los beneficiarios de esta política fiscal de posibles cambios de política por parte de futuros gobiernos.[10]​En paralelo En 2019, uno de cada tres asalariados griegos trabaja a tiempo parcial con un salario neto de 317 euros y el 34,8% de la población está en riesgo de pobreza o exclusión social. La desigualdad también ha aumentado junto con la evasión fiscal que le costará al Estado griego 30.000 millones de euros anuales.\n\nEl \"proyecto de ley de gran crecimiento\", aprobado en el verano de 2020, prevé la restricción del derecho de huelga y la supresión de los convenios colectivos, que ya habían sido suspendidos en 2012 a petición de la Troika y luego restablecidos por el Gobierno de Tsipras. La política migratoria se ha endurecido: se ha suprimido la cobertura de la atención hospitalaria a los extranjeros indigentes y se ha reducido de seis meses a un mes el periodo durante el cual los refugiados a los que se ha concedido asilo pueden residir en viviendas sociales. En materia de medio ambiente, el gobierno reforma la legislación para facilitar la exploración petrolera cercana a áreas protegidas.[11]​\n\nA pesar de la pandemia de Covid-19, el Parlamento griego ha aprobado un presupuesto que incluye un recorte del gasto sanitario y un aumento de casi el 60% del gasto en defensa para el año 2021, en un contexto de tensiones con Turquía.[12]​\n\nEl gobierno decidió encerrar los 25 campos de solicitantes de asilo del país con muros de hormigón de tres metros de altura, oficialmente para garantizar la seguridad de los refugiados. Sin embargo, los activistas de derechos humanos afirman que esta política prohíbe la integración de los refugiados al negarles el acceso al trabajo y la escolarización de sus hijos. En su plan estratégico 2020-2021, el gobierno planea endurecer la política de aislamiento de los refugiados construyendo una doble valla de alambre de espino, permitiendo sólo un número limitado de salidas a la semana entre las 8 de la mañana y las 8 de la tarde, un sistema de videovigilancia, detectores de metales en la entrada y drones que sobrevuelen los campos.[13]​\n\nEn el ámbito de la educación, nuevas leyes eliminan la sociología y las artes del plan de estudios de secundaria, pero refuerzan el griego antiguo y el lugar de la religión. A principios de 2021 se creó un cuerpo especial de policía para patrullar los campus universitarios; estaría formado por 1.000 policías equipados con porras y spray antiagresión. Las protestas de estudiantes y académicos han cuestionado la medida. El coste de la brigada -20 millones de euros al año, frente a los 91,6 millones del presupuesto anual para enseñanza superior- ha sido objeto de críticas.[14]​\n\nEn 2007 se informó de que Kyriákos Mitsotákis había estado involucrado en el escándalo de sobornos de Siemens Grecia.[15]​ Sin embargo, Mitsotakis declaró que no tuvo ninguna implicación en el incidente y que hasta el momento no se ha comprobado su culpabilidad.[16]​ La investigación del caso Siemens aún permanece pendiente y se esperaba que comenzara en febrero de 2017.[17]​\n\nEn la acusación, se afirma que Kyriákos Mitsotákis había recibido por parte de Siemens y otras dos subsidiarias, equipos electrónicos de oficina, centros de llamadas, aire acondicionado, y otros productos que equivalen a un total de 130 000 euros, los cuales fueron recibidos en un período previo a las elecciones parlamentarias de 2007 (entre junio y septiembre de ese año). Las facturas indican un periodo de pago de hasta 60 días, sin embargo, parte de ese monto no fue pagado hasta febrero de 2008, cuando se pagó parte de este, justo cuando el caso de Siemens fue reabierto por los tribunales, y una cantidad de 43 850 euros fue pagada por un cheque a nombre de Mitsotakis el lunes 2 de junio. Días antes (el 29 de mayo), se habían hecho declaraciones sobre \"donaciones y subvenciones hacia políticos por parte de Siemens\" y el 30 de mayo de 2008, el fiscal a cargo de la investigación ordenó el allanamiento de las oficinas de la compañía.[18]​\n\nEn julio de 2022, los servicios de ciberseguridad del Parlamento Europeo encontraron rastros de programas espía en el teléfono móvil del eurodiputado socialista Nikos Androulakis, lo que dio lugar a la publicidad de las escuchas a dirigentes de la oposición y periodistas, espiados por los servicios de inteligencia griegos (EYP).\n\nAnte el escándalo, dimitieron el secretario general de la oficina del primer ministro, que es también su sobrino, Grigoris Dimitriadis, y Panagiotis Kontoleon, director de los servicios de inteligencia. Kyriákos Mitsotákis ha negado estar implicado en el asunto y ha acusado a su predecesor Alexis Tsipras de haberle puesto micrófonos ocultos cuando estaba en el poder, al tiempo que ha afirmado la necesidad de contar con un servicio de inteligencia eficaz para hacer frente a un vecino como Turquía. La negativa del primer ministro a reconocer su responsabilidad, a pesar de que había puesto al PEJ -antes dependiente del Ministerio del Interior- directamente bajo su autoridad cuando asumió el cargo, acentuó la polémica.[19]​\n\nEn el Parlamento, 142 diputados votaron a favor de abrir una investigación parlamentaria: \"Espiar a políticos, personalidades, periodistas y empresarios no es normal... Tenemos un primer ministro que no lo sabía (...), que no responde, que se niega a asumir sus responsabilidades políticas y sigue queriendo tapar el escándalo de las escuchas\", denunció el presidente del grupo parlamentario del Partido Socialista.[19]​\n\nKyriakos tiene tres hijos, Sofía, Konstantinos y Dafni. Además del griego, sabe hablar inglés, francés y alemán.\n\nMitsotakis es el hermano menor de Dora Bakoyannis, exministra de Asuntos Exteriores y alcaldesa de Atenas, es cuñado de Pavlos Bakoyannis (1935-1989, asesinado por la Organización Revolucionaria 17 de Noviembre, una organización armada terrorista griega) y tío de Kostas Bakoyannis, actual alcalde de Atenas.\n• Sitio web oficial (en inglés y en griego)\n• legislaturas Kyriakos Mitsotakis Consejo de los Helenos ( )Kyriakos Mitsotakis - Hellenic Parliament | LinkedIn: By clicking Continue to join or sign in, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy."}

It is often referred to as Washington state[a] to distinguish it from the national capital,[6] both named after George Washington (the first U.S. president). Washington borders the Pacific Ocean to the west, Oregon to the south, Idaho to the east, and shares an international border with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. Olympia is the state capital, and the most populous city is Seattle.\n\nWashington is the 18th-largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), and the 13th-most populous state, with a population of just less than 8 million.[7] The majority of Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and industry on Puget Sound,[8][9] an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep fjords and bays carved out by glaciers. The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, center, northeast, and far southeast; and a semi-arid basin region in the east, center, and south, given over to intensive agriculture. Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States, after California. Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano, is the state's highest elevation at 14,411 feet (4,392 meters), and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S.\n\nWashington is a leading lumber producer, the largest producer of apples, hops, pears, blueberries, spearmint oil, and sweet cherries in the U.S., and ranks high in the production of apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes.[10][11] Livestock, livestock products, and commercial fishing—particularly of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish—are also significant contributors to the state's economy.[12] Washington ranks second only to California in wine production. Manufacturing industries in Washington include aircraft, missiles, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment, food processing, metals, and metal products, chemicals, and machinery.[13]\n\nThe state was formed from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in the Oregon Treaty of 1846. It was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. One of the wealthiest and most socially liberal states in the country,[14] Washington consistently ranks among the top states for highest life expectancy and employment rates.[15] It was one of the first states (alongside Colorado) to legalize medicinal and recreational cannabis,[16] was among the first states to introduce same-sex marriage,[17] and was one of only four states to have provided legal abortions on request before Roe v. Wade in 1973.[18] Washington voters also approved a 2008 referendum on the legalization of physician-assisted suicide,[19] making it one of 10 states to have legalized the practice.[20]\n\nWashington was named after President George Washington by an act of the United States Congress during the creation of Washington Territory in 1853; the territory was to be named \"Columbia\", for the Columbia River and the Columbia District, but Kentucky representative Richard H. Stanton found the name too similar to the District of Columbia (the national capital, itself containing the city of Washington), and proposed naming the new territory after President Washington.[21][22][23] Washington is the only U.S. state named after a president.[24]\n\nConfusion between the state of Washington and the city of Washington, D.C., led to renaming proposals during the statehood process for Washington in 1889, including David Dudley Field II's suggestion to name the new state \"Tacoma\"; these proposals failed to garner support.[25] Washington, D.C.'s, own statehood movement in the 21st century has included a proposal to use the name \"State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth\", which would conflict with the current state of Washington.[5] Residents of Washington (known as \"Washingtonians\") and the Pacific Northwest simply refer to the state as \"Washington\", and the nation's capital \"Washington, D.C.\", \"the other Washington\",[26] or simply \"D.C.\"\n\nThe 9,300-year-old skeletal remains of Kennewick Man, one of the oldest and most complete human remains found in North America, were discovered in Washington in the 1990s.[27] The region has been home to many established tribes of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. They are notable for their ornately carved welcome figures, canoes, long houses and masks. Prominent among their industries were salmon fishing and, notably among the Makah, whale hunting.[28][29] The peoples of the Interior had a different subsistence-based culture based on hunting, food-gathering and some forms of agriculture, as well as a dependency on salmon from the Columbia and its tributaries.\n\nThe area has been known to host megathrust earthquakes in the past, the last being the Cascadia earthquake of 1700.[30]\n\nThe first recorded European landing on the Washington coast was by Spanish Captain Don Bruno de Heceta in 1775,[31] on board the Santiago, part of a two-ship flotilla with the Sonora. He claimed the coastal lands up to Prince William Sound for Spain as part of their claimed rights under the Treaty of Tordesillas, which they maintained made the Pacific a \"Spanish lake\" and all its shores part of the Spanish Empire. Soon thereafter, the smallpox epidemic of the 1770s devastated the Native American population.[32]\n\nIn 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook sighted Cape Flattery, at the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, but Cook did not realize the strait existed.[33] It was not discovered until Charles William Barkley, captain of the Imperial Eagle, sighted it in 1787.[34] The straits were further explored by Spanish explorers Manuel Quimper in 1790 and Francisco de Eliza in 1791,[35][36] and British explorer George Vancouver in 1792.[37]\n\nThe British–Spanish Nootka Convention of 1790 ended Spanish claims of exclusivity and opened the Northwest Coast to explorers and traders from other nations, most notably Britain and Russia as well as the fledgling United States.[38][39] American captain Robert Gray (for whom Grays Harbor County is named) then discovered the mouth of the Columbia River. He named the river after his ship, the Columbia.[40] Beginning in 1792, Gray established trade in sea otter pelts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the state on October 10, 1805.[41]\n\nExplorer David Thompson, on his voyage down the Columbia River, camped at the confluence with the Snake River on July 9, 1811,[42] and erected a pole and a notice claiming the territory for Great Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a trading post at the site.\n\nBritain and the United States agreed to what has since been described as \"joint occupancy\" of lands west of the Continental Divide to the Pacific Ocean as part of the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which established the 49th parallel as the international boundary west from Lake of the Woods to the Rocky Mountains.[43] Resolution of the territorial and treaty issues west to the Pacific was deferred until a later time. In 1819, Spain ceded its rights north of the 42nd parallel to the United States.[44]\n\nNegotiations with Great Britain over the next few decades failed to settle upon a compromise boundary and the Oregon boundary dispute was highly contested between Britain and the United States. Disputed joint occupancy by Britain and the U.S. lasted for several decades. With American settlers pouring into Oregon Country, Hudson's Bay Company, which had previously discouraged settlement because it conflicted with the fur trade, reversed its position in an attempt to maintain British control of the Columbia District.[45]\n\nFur trapper James Sinclair, on orders from Sir George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, led some 200 settlers from the Red River Colony west in 1841 to settle on Hudson Bay Company farms near Fort Vancouver.[46] The party crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley, near present-day Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia, then traveled south-west down the Kootenai River and Columbia River. Despite such efforts, Britain eventually ceded all claims to land south of the 49th parallel to the United States in the Oregon Treaty on June 15, 1846.[47]\n\nIn 1836, a group of missionaries, including Marcus Whitman, established several missions and Whitman's own settlement Waiilatpu, in what is now southeastern Washington state, near present-day Walla Walla County, in the territory of both the Cayuse and the Nez Perce Indian tribes.[48] Whitman's settlement would in 1843 help the Oregon Trail, the overland emigration route to the west, get established for thousands of emigrants in the following decades. Whitman provided medical care for the Native Americans, but when Indian patients—lacking immunity to new, \"European\" diseases—died in striking numbers, while at the same time many white patients recovered, they held \"medicine man\" Marcus Whitman personally responsible, and executed Whitman and twelve other white settlers. This was called the Whitman massacre in 1847.[49] This event triggered the Cayuse War between settlers and Indians.\n\nFort Nisqually, a farm and trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company and the first European settlement in the Puget Sound area, was founded in 1833.[50] Black pioneer George Washington Bush and his Caucasian wife, Isabella James Bush, from Missouri and Tennessee, respectively, led four white families into the territory and founded New Market, now Tumwater, in 1846.[51] They settled in Washington to avoid Oregon's black exclusion law, which prohibited African Americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting slavery.[52][53] After them, many more settlers, migrating overland along the Oregon Trail, wandered north to settle in the Puget Sound area.\n\nSpanish and Russian claims to the region were ceded in the early 19th century through a series of treaties. The Spanish signed the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, and the Russians the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and 1825.\n\nThe Oregon Question remained contested between the United Kingdom and the United States until the 1846 Oregon Treaty established the border between British North America and the United States along the 49th parallel until the Strait of Georgia.[47] Vague wording in the treaty left the ownership of the San Juan Islands in doubt; during the so-called Pig War, both nations agreed to a joint military occupation of the islands.[54] Kaiser Wilhelm I of the German Empire was selected as an arbitrator to end the dispute, with a three-man commission ruling in favor of the United States in 1872. The border established by the Oregon Treaty and finalized by the arbitration in 1872 remains the boundary between Washington and British Columbia.\n\nThe growing population of Oregon Territory north of the Columbia River formally requested a new territory. As a result of the Monticello Convention, held in present-day Cowlitz County, the U.S. Congress passed legislation to create Washington Territory. It was signed into law by President Millard Fillmore on March 2, 1853.[55][23] The boundary of Washington Territory initially extended farther east than the present state, including what is now the Idaho panhandle and parts of western Montana, and picked up more land to the southeast that was left behind when Oregon was admitted as a state; the creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 established the final eastern border. A Washington state constitution was drafted and ratified in 1878, but it was never officially adopted.[56] Although never approved by the United States Congress, the 1878 constitution is an important historical document that shows the political thinking of the time; it was used extensively during the drafting of Washington state's 1889 constitution, the one and only official Constitution of the State of Washington. Washington became the 42nd state of the United States on November 11, 1889.[57]\n\nEarly prominent industries in the new state included agriculture and lumber. In Eastern Washington, the Yakima River Valley became known for its apple orchards,[58] while the growth of wheat using dry farming techniques became particularly productive. Heavy rainfall to the west of the Cascade Range produced dense forests, and the ports along Puget Sound prospered from the manufacturing and shipping of lumber products, particularly the Douglas fir. Other industries that developed in the state included fishing, salmon canning and mining.[12][59]\n\nFor a long period, Tacoma had large smelters where gold, silver, copper, and lead ores were treated.[60] Seattle was the primary port for trade with Alaska and the rest of the country, and for a time, it possessed a large shipbuilding industry. The region around eastern Puget Sound developed heavy industry during the period including World War I and World War II, and the Boeing company became an established icon in the area.[61]\n\nDuring the Great Depression, a series of hydroelectric dams were constructed along the Columbia River as part of a project to increase the production of electricity. This culminated in 1941 with the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest concrete structure in the United States and the largest dam in the world at its construction.[62]\n\nDuring World War II, the state became a focus for war industries. While the Boeing Company produced many heavy bombers, ports in Seattle, Bremerton, Vancouver, and Tacoma were available for the manufacture of warships. Seattle was the point of departure for many soldiers in the Pacific, several of whom were quartered at Fort Lawton, which later became Discovery Park.[63] In Eastern Washington, the Hanford Works atomic energy plant was opened in 1943 and played a major role in the construction of atomic bombs.[64]\n\nAfter the end of World War II, and with the beginning of the civil rights movement, the state's growing Black or African-American population's wages were 53% above the national average. The early diversification of Washington through the Great Migration led to successful efforts at reducing discrimination in the workplace.[65][66] In 1950, Seattle's first black representative for the state's legislature was elected. At the 1970 U.S. census, the black population grew to 7.13% of the total population.[67]\n\nIn 1970, the state was one of only four U.S. states to have been providing legal abortions before the 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade which loosened abortion laws nationwide.[18][68]\n\nOn May 18, 1980, following a period of heavy tremors and small eruptions, the north face of Mount St. Helens slid off in the largest landslide in recorded history before erupting violently, destroying a large part of the top of the volcano. The eruption flattened the forest up to 12 mi (20 km) north of the volcano, killed 57 people, flooded the Columbia River and its tributaries with ash and mud, and blanketed large parts of Washington eastward and other surrounding states in ash, making day look like night.[69][70]\n\nWashington is the northwesternmost state of the contiguous United States. It borders Idaho to the east, bounded mostly by the meridian running north from the confluence of the Snake River and Clearwater River (about 117°02'23\" west), except for the southernmost section where the border follows the Snake River. Oregon is to the south, with the Columbia River forming the western part and the 46th parallel forming the eastern part of the Oregon–Washington border. During Washington's partition from Oregon, the original plan for the border followed the Columbia River east until the confluence with the Snake, and then would have followed the Snake River east; this was changed to keep Walla Walla's fertile farmland in Washington.\n\nTo the west of Washington lies the Pacific Ocean.[71] Its northern border lies mostly along the 49th parallel, and then via marine boundaries through the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait, and Strait of Juan de Fuca, with the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north.[72]\n\nWashington is part of a region known as the Pacific Northwest, a term which always refers to at least Washington and Oregon, and may or may not include some or all the following, depending on the user's intent: Idaho, western Montana, northern California, British Columbia, and Alaska.\n\nThe high mountains of the Cascade Range run north–south, bisecting the state. In addition to Western Washington and Eastern Washington, residents call the two parts of the state the \"Westside\" and the \"Eastside\", \"Wet side\" and \"Dry side\", or \"Timberland\" and \"Wheatland\", the latter pair more commonly in the names of region-specific businesses and institutions. These terms reflect the geography, climate, and industry of the land on both sides of the Cascades.\n\nFrom the Cascade Mountains westward, Western Washington has a mostly Mediterranean climate, with mild temperatures and wet winters, autumns and springs, and relatively dry summers. The Cascade Range has several volcanoes, which reach altitudes significantly higher than the rest of the mountains. From north to south, these major volcanoes are Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams. All are active volcanoes.[73]\n\nMount Rainier—the tallest mountain in the state[74]—is 50 miles (80 km) south of the city of Seattle, from which it is prominently visible. The United States Geological Survey considers 14,411-foot-tall (4,392 m) Mount Rainier the most dangerous volcano in the Cascade Range, due to its proximity to the Seattle metropolitan area, and most dangerous in the continental U.S. according to the Decade Volcanoes list.[75] It is also covered with more glacial ice than any other peak in the contiguous 48 states.[76]\n\nWestern Washington also is home of the Olympic Mountains, far west on the Olympic Peninsula, which support dense forests of conifers and areas of temperate rainforest. These deep forests, such as the Hoh Rainforest, are among the only rainforests in the continental United States.[77] While Western Washington does not always experience a high amount of rainfall as measured in total inches of rain per year, it does consistently have more rainy days per year than most other places in the country.[78]\n\nEastern Washington—the part of the state east of the Cascades—has a relatively dry climate, in distinct contrast to the west side. It includes large areas of semiarid steppe and a few truly arid deserts in the rain shadow of the Cascades; the Hanford reservation receives an average annual precipitation of 6 to 7 inches (150 to 180 mm). Despite the limited amount of rainfall, agriculture is an extremely important business throughout much of Eastern Washington, as the soil is highly productive and irrigation, aided by dams along the Columbia River, is fairly widespread.[79] The spread of population in Eastern Washington is dominated by access to water, especially rivers. The main cities are all located alongside rivers or lakes; most of them are named after the river or lake they adjoin.\n\nFarther east, the climate becomes less arid, with annual rainfall increasing as one goes east to 21.2 inches (540 mm) in Pullman, near the Washington–Idaho border.[80] The Okanogan Highlands and the rugged Kettle River Range and Selkirk Mountains cover much of the state's northeastern quadrant. The Palouse southeast region of Washington was grassland that has been mostly converted into farmland, and extends to the Blue Mountains.[81]\n\nThe state of Washington has a temperate climate. The eastern half of Washington has a semi-arid to warm-summer mediterranean climate, while the western side of Washington as well as the coastal areas of the state have a cool oceanic climate or warm-summer mediterranean climate. Major factors determining Washington's climate include the large semi-permanent low pressure and high pressure systems of the north Pacific Ocean, the continental air masses of North America, and the Olympic and Cascade mountains. In the spring and summer, a high-pressure anticyclone system dominates the north Pacific Ocean, causing air to spiral out in a clockwise fashion. For Washington, this means prevailing winds from the northwest bring relatively cool air and a predictably dry season.[83][failed verification]\n\nIn the autumn and winter, a low-pressure cyclone system takes over in the north Pacific Ocean. The air spiraling inward in a counter-clockwise fashion causes Washington's prevailing winds to come from the southwest, and bring cool and overcast weather and a predictably wet season. The term \"Pineapple Express\" is used colloquially to describe atmospheric river events, where repeated storm systems are directed by this persistent cyclone from the tropical Pacific regions a great distance into the Pacific Northwest. Western Washington is very cloudy during much of fall, winter, and early spring. Seattle averages the least sunshine hours of any major city in the United States.[84]\n\nDespite Western Washington's marine climate similar to many coastal cities of Europe, there are exceptions such as the \"Big Snow\" events of 1880, 1881, 1893, and 1916,[85][86] and the \"deep freeze\" winters of 1883–1884, 1915–1916, 1949–1950, and 1955–1956, among others.[87] During these events, Western Washington experienced up to 6 feet (1.8 m) of snow, sub-zero (−18 °C) temperatures, three months with snow on the ground, and lakes and rivers frozen over for weeks.[86] Seattle's lowest officially recorded temperature is 0 °F (−18 °C) set on January 31, 1950, but low-altitude areas approximately three hours away from Seattle have recorded lows as cold as −48 °F (−44 °C).[88]\n\nThe Southern Oscillation greatly influences weather during the cold season. During the El Niño phase, the jet stream enters the U.S. farther south through California, therefore late fall and winter are drier than normal with less snowpack. The La Niña phase reinforces the jet stream through the Pacific Northwest, causing Washington to have more rain and snow than average.[89]\n\nIn 2006, the Climate Impacts Group at the University of Washington published The Impacts of Climate Change in Washington's Economy, a preliminary assessment of the risks and opportunities presented given the possibility of a rise in global temperatures and their effects on Washington state.[90]\n\nRainfall in Washington varies dramatically going from east to west. The Olympic Peninsula's western side receives as much as 160 inches (4,100 mm) of precipitation annually, making it the wettest area of the 48 conterminous states and a temperate rainforest. Weeks may pass without a clear day. The western slopes of the Cascade Range receive some of the heaviest annual snowfall (in some places more than 200 inches or 5,100 millimeters water equivalent) in the country. In the rain shadow area east of the Cascades, the annual precipitation is only 6 inches (150 mm). Precipitation then increases again eastward toward the Rocky Mountains (about 120 miles (190 km) east of the Idaho border).\n\nThe Olympic mountains and Cascades compound this climatic pattern by causing orographic lift of the air masses blown inland from the Pacific Ocean, resulting in the windward side of the mountains receiving high levels of precipitation and the leeward side receiving low levels. This occurs most dramatically around the Olympic Mountains and the Cascade Range. In both cases, the windward slopes facing southwest receive high precipitation and mild, cool temperatures. While the Puget Sound lowlands are known for clouds and rain in the winter, the western slopes of the Cascades receive larger amounts of precipitation, often falling as snow at higher elevations.[91] Mount Baker, near the state's northern border, is one of the snowiest places in the world. In 1999, it set the world record for snowfall in a single season—1,140 inches (95 ft; 29 m).[92]\n\nEast of the Cascades, a large region experiences strong rain shadow effects. Semi-arid conditions occur in much of Eastern Washington with the strongest rain shadow effects at the relatively low elevations of the central Columbia Plateau—especially the region just east of the Columbia River from about the Snake River to the Okanagan Highland. Thus, instead of rain forests, much of Eastern Washington is covered with dry grassland, shrub-steppe, and dunes.\n\nThe average annual temperature ranges from 51 °F (11 °C) on the Pacific coast to 40 °F (4 °C) in the northeast. The lowest temperature recorded in the state was −48 °F (−44 °C) in Winthrop and Mazama. The highest recorded temperature in the state was 120 °F (49 °C) at Hanford on June 29, 2021.[93][94] Both records were set east of the Cascades. Western Washington is known for its mild climate, considerable fog, frequent cloud cover, long-lasting drizzles in the winter and warm, temperate summers. The eastern region, which does not benefit from the general moderating effect of the Pacific Ocean, occasionally experiences extreme climate. Arctic cold fronts in the winter and heat waves in the summer are not uncommon. In the Western region, temperatures have reached as high as 118 °F (48 °C) in Maple Valley[95] during the June 2021 heat wave, and as low as −6 °F (−21 °C) in Longview,[96] and even −8 °F (−22 °C) in Sammamish.[97]\n\nForests cover about half the state's land area, mostly west of the northern Cascades. Approximately two-thirds of Washington's forested area is publicly owned, including 64 percent of federal land.[108] Common trees and plants in the region are camassia, Douglas fir, hemlock, penstemon, ponderosa pine, western red cedar, and many species of ferns.[109] The state's various areas of wilderness offer sanctuary, with substantially large populations of shorebirds and marine mammals. The Pacific shore surrounding the San Juan Islands is heavily inhabited by killer, gray, and humpback whales.[110]\n\nIn Eastern Washington, the flora is vastly different. Tumbleweeds and sagebrush dominate the landscape throughout large parts of the countryside. Russian olives and other trees are common alongside riverbanks; however, apart from the riversides, large swaths of Eastern Washington have no naturally existing trees at all (though many trees have been planted and are irrigated by people, of course). A wider variety of flora can be found in both the Blue Mountains and the eastern sides of the Cascades.\n\nMammals native to the state include the bat, black bear, bobcat, cougar, coyote, deer, elk, gray wolf, hare, moose, mountain beaver, muskrat, opossum, pocket gopher, rabbit, raccoon, river otter, skunk, and tree squirrel.[111] Because of the wide range of geography, the state of Washington is home to several different ecoregions, which allow for a varied range of bird species. This range includes raptors, shorebirds, woodland birds, grassland birds, ducks, and others.[112] There have also been a large number of species introduced to Washington, dating back to the early 18th century, including horses and burros.[113] The channel catfish, lamprey, and sturgeon are among the 400 known freshwater fishes.[114][115] Along with the Cascades frog, there are several forms of snakes that define the most prominent reptiles and amphibians.[116][117] Coastal bays and islands are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of shellfish and whales. There are five species of salmon that ascend the Western Washington area, from streams to spawn.[110]\n\nWashington has a variety of National Park Service units. Among these are the Alta Lake State Park, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, San Juan Islands National Wildlife Refuge, as well as three national parks—the Olympic National Park, North Cascades National Park, and Mount Rainier National Park.[118] The three national parks were established between 1899 and 1968. Almost 95 percent (876,517 acres, 354,714 hectares, 3,547.14 square kilometers) of Olympic National Park's area has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System.[119] Additionally, there are 143 state parks and 9 national forests, run by the Washington State Park System and the United States Forest Service.[120] The Okanogan National Forest is the largest national forest on the West Coast, encompassing 1,499,023 acres (606,633 ha). It is managed together as the Okanogan–Wenatchee National Forest, encompassing a considerably larger area of around 3,239,404 acres (1,310,940 ha).[121]\n\nThere are 39 counties within the state, and 281 incorporated municipalities which are divided into cities and towns.[122] The majority of the state's population lives within Western Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area; the city of Seattle is the principal city of the metropolitan area, and Western Washington, with a 2020 census population of 737,015.[123]\n\nWashington's population was 7,705,281 in the 2020 census,[129] a 14.6% increase since the 2010 census.[130] In 2020, the state ranked 13th overall in population, and was the third most populous, after California and Texas, west of the Mississippi River.[131] Washington has the largest population among states in the Pacific Northwest, followed by Oregon and Idaho. The Washington State Office of Financial Management estimated the state population to be 7,951,150 as of April 1, 2023.[132]\n\nThe Seattle–Tacoma–Bellevue metropolitan area's population was 4,018,762 in the 2020 census, more than half the state total.[133] The center of population of Washington in 2010 was at 47°20′N 121°37′W﻿ / ﻿47.33°N 121.62°W﻿ / 47.33; -121.62, in an unpopulated part of the Cascade Mountains in rural eastern King County, southeast of North Bend, northeast of Enumclaw, and west of Snoqualmie Pass.[134]\n\nIn 2020, Washington's proportion of residents under the age of five was 5.7%, 21.8% under 18, and 16.3% 65 or older.[135]\n\nFour-fifths of the state's population identifies as White or European American. Washington has some of the largest Native American and Asian populations among states in the U.S.; the state also has a small proportion of African Americans. Washington's Hispanic community began growing rapidly in the late 20th century.[110] In 2018, the top countries of origin for Washington's immigrants were Mexico, India, China, the Philippines and Vietnam.[136] There are 29 federally recognized Native American tribes in the state, mostly in Western Washington, and other unrecognized groups.[137]\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 25,211 homeless people in Washington.[138][139]\n\nThe racial composition of Washington's population as of the 2020 census was:\n\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 12.1% of Washington's population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (9.7%), Puerto Rican (0.4%), Cuban (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (1.8%).[145] The five largest ancestry groups were: German (17.8%), Irish (10.8%), English (10.4%), Norwegian (5.4%), and American (4.6%).[146]\n\nIn 2011, 44.3 percent of Washington's population younger than age 1 were minorities.[147]\n\nNote: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n• Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\nWhile the population of African Americans in the Pacific Northwest is relatively scarce overall, they are mostly concentrated in the South End and Central District areas of Seattle, and in inner Tacoma.[158] The black community of Seattle consisted of one individual in 1858, Manuel Lopes, and grew to a population of 406 by 1900.[159] It developed substantially during and after World War II when wartime industries and the U.S. Armed Forces employed and recruited tens of thousands of African Americans from the Southeastern United States. They moved west in the second wave of the Great Migration, leaving a high influence on West Coast rock music and R&B and soul in the 1960s, including Seattle native Jimi Hendrix, a pioneer in hard rock, who was of African-American and alleged Cherokee descent.\n\nNative Americans lived on Indian reservations or jurisdiction lands such as the Colville Indian Reservation, Makah, Muckleshoot Indian Reservation, Quinault, Salish people, Spokane Indian Reservation, and Yakama Indian Reservation. The westernmost and Pacific coasts have primarily American Indian communities, such as the Chinook, Lummi, and Salish. Urban Indian communities formed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs relocation programs in Seattle since the end of World War II brought a variety of Native American peoples to this diverse metropolis. The city was named for Chief Seattle in the very early 1850s when European Americans settled the sound.\n\nAsian Americans are mostly concentrated in the Seattle−Tacoma metropolitan area of the state. Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond, which are all within King County, have sizable Chinese communities (including Taiwanese), as well as significant Indian and Japanese communities. The Chinatown–International District in Seattle has a historical Chinese population dating back to the 1860s, who mainly emigrated from Guangdong Province in southern China, and is home to a diverse East and Southeast Asian community. Koreans are heavily concentrated in the suburban cities of Federal Way and Auburn to the south, and in Lynnwood to the north. Tacoma is home to thousands of Cambodians, and has one of the largest Cambodian-American communities in the United States, along with Long Beach, California, and Lowell, Massachusetts.[160] The Vietnamese and Filipino populations of Washington are mostly concentrated within the Seattle metropolitan area.[161]\n\nWashington state has the second highest percentage of Pacific Islander people in the mainland U.S. (behind Utah); the Seattle–Tacoma area is home to more than 15,000 people of Samoan ancestry, who mainly reside in southeast Seattle, Tacoma, Federal Way, and in SeaTac.[162][163]\n\nThe most numerous (ethnic, not racial, group) are Latinos at 11%, as Mexican Americans formed a large ethnic group in the Chehalis Valley, Skagit Valley, farming areas of Yakima Valley, and Eastern Washington. They were reported to at least date as far back as the 1800s.[164] But it was in the late 20th century, that large-scale Mexican immigration and other Latinos settled in the southern suburbs of Seattle, with limited concentrations in King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties during the region's real estate construction booms in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nAdditionally, Washington has a large Ethiopian community, with many Eritrean residents as well.[165] Both emerged in the late 1960s, and developed since 1980.[166] An estimated 30,000 Somali immigrants reside in the Seattle area.[167]\n\nIn 2010, 82.51% (5,060,313) of Washington residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.79% (477,566) spoke Spanish, 1.19% (72,552) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Standard Chinese), 0.94% (57,895) Vietnamese, 0.84% (51,301) Tagalog, 0.83% (50,757) Korean, 0.80% (49,282) Russian, and 0.55% (33,744) German. In total, 17.49% (1,073,002) of Washington's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[168]\n\nMajor religious affiliations of the people of Washington are:[170]\n\nThe largest denominations by number of adherents in 2010 were the Roman Catholic Church, with 784,332; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, with 282,356;[171] and the Assemblies of God, with 125,005.[172]\n\nAquarian Tabernacle Church is the largest Wiccan church in the country.[173]\n\nLike other West Coast states, the percentage of Washington's population identifying themselves as \"non-religious\" is higher than the national average.\n\nWashington has a relatively strong economy, with a total gross state product of $801.5 billion in 2023, placing it eleventh in the nation and growing by 8.6 percent per year—among the fastest rates in the United States.[174] In the late 2010s, the state had the fastest-growing economy in the United States and was tenth-largest in the nation.[175] The minimum wage was set at $11 in 2017 and has increased annually based on a cost-of-living index; since January 1, 2024, it has been $16.28 an hour, the highest of any state.[176] Several cities have higher minimum wages as of 2024 , such as Seattle at $19.97 for large employers and Tukwila at $20.29 for large employers.[177][178] As of September 2023 , the state's unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, ranked 36th among states.[179]\n\nSignificant business within the state include the design and manufacture of aircraft (Boeing), automotive (Paccar), computer software development (Microsoft, Bungie, Amazon, Nintendo of America, Valve, ArenaNet, Cyan Worlds), telecom (T-Mobile US), electronics, biotechnology, aluminum production, lumber and wood products (Weyerhaeuser), mining, beverages (Starbucks, Jones Soda), real estate (John L. Scott, Colliers International, Windermere Real Estate, Kidder Mathews), retail (Nordstrom, Eddie Bauer, Car Toys, Costco, R.E.I.), and tourism (Alaska Airlines, Expedia, Inc.). A Fortune magazine survey of the top 20 Most Admired Companies in the U.S. has four Washington-based companies: Amazon, Starbucks, Microsoft, and Costco.[180] At over 80 percent the state has significant amounts of hydroelectric power generation. Also, significant amounts of trade with Asia pass through the ports of the Puget Sound, leading to a number six ranking of U.S. ports (ranking combines twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) moved and infrastructure index).[181]\n\nWith the passage of Initiative 1183, the Washington State Liquor Control Board (WSLCB) ended its monopoly of all-state liquor store and liquor distribution operations on June 1, 2012. The board transitioned into licensing and regulating the sale of alcohol, tobacco, and later cannabis after the passage of Initiative 502.[182][183]\n\nThe state is home to several of the wealthiest people in the United States and the world by net worth. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos both held the title of world's richest person, as determined by Forbes, while living in Washington.[184]\n\nThe state of Washington is one of seven states that do not levy a personal income tax. The state does not collect a corporate income tax or franchise tax either. Washington businesses are responsible for various other state levies, including the business and occupation tax (B & O), a gross receipts tax which charges varying rates for different types of businesses.\n\nWashington's state base sales tax is 6.5%, which is combined with a local sales tax that varies by locality. The combined state and local retail sales tax rates increase the taxes paid by consumers, depending on the variable local sales tax rates, generally between 7.5% and 10%.[185] As of 2024 , the combined sales tax rate in Seattle was 10.25%. The Snohomish County cities of Lynnwood, Mill Creek, Mukilteo are tied for the highest sales tax rate in the state at 10.6%.[186] These taxes apply to services as well as products, but not most foods due to a 1977 ballot measure.[187][188] However, prepared foods, dietary supplements, and soft drinks remain taxable.[189]\n\nAn excise tax applies to certain products such as gasoline, cigarettes, and alcoholic beverages. Property tax was the first tax levied in the state of Washington, and its collection accounts for about 30% of Washington's total state and local revenue. It continues to be the most important revenue source for public schools, fire protection, libraries, parks and recreation, and other special-purpose districts.\n\nAll real property and personal property are subject to tax unless specifically exempted by law. Most personal property owned by individuals is exempt from tax. Personal property tax applies to personal property used when conducting business, or to other personal property not exempt by law. All property taxes are paid to the county treasurer's office where the property is located. Neither does the state assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Washington does not collect inheritance taxes. However, the estate tax is de-coupled from the federal estate tax laws, and therefore, the state imposes its estate tax.\n\nWashington state has the 18th highest per capita effective tax rate in the United States, as of 2017.[citation needed] As of June 2023 , Washington has the highest gasoline prices in the United States, at an average of $4.97, in part due to the third-highest gasoline tax in the country.[190] Their tax policy differs from neighboring Oregon's, which levies no sales tax, but does levy a personal income tax. This leads to border economic anomalies in the Portland–Vancouver metropolitan area.[191] Additional border economies with tax disparities exist with neighboring Idaho, which has a lower sales tax rate;[192] and British Columbia, which has higher costs for goods and has residents who commute into Washington for shopping.[193] These include remote mailbox and courier services for American online retailers, which became ubiquitous in border communities in the 21st century.[194]\n\nWashington is a leading agricultural state. For 2018, the total value of Washington's agricultural products was $10.6 billion.[11] In 2014, Washington ranked first in the nation in production of red raspberries (90.5 percent of total U.S. production), hops (79.3 percent), spearmint oil (75 percent), wrinkled seed peas (70.4 percent), apples (71.1 percent), sweet cherries (62.3 percent), pears (45.6 percent), Concord grapes (55.1 percent), carrots for processing (30.6 percent), and green peas for processing (32.4 percent).[195]\n\nWashington also ranked second in the nation in the production of fall potatoes (a quarter of the nation's production), nectarines, apricots, asparagus, all raspberries, grapes (all varieties taken together), sweet corn for processing (a quarter of the nation's production), and summer onions (a fifth of the nation's production). Washington also ranked third in the nation in the production of dried peas, lentils, onions, and peppermint oil.[11]\n\nThe apple industry is of particular importance to Washington. Because of the favorable climate of dry, warm summers and cold winters of central Washington, the state has led the U.S. in apple production since the 1920s.[196] Two areas account for the vast majority of the state's apple crop: the Wenatchee–Okanogan region (comprising Chelan, Okanogan, Douglas, and Grant counties), and the Yakima region (comprising Yakima, Benton, and Kittitas counties).[197] Washington produces seven principal varieties of apples which are exported to more than sixty countries.[198]\n\nWashington ranks second in the United States in the production of wine, behind only California.[199] By 2006, the state had over 31,000 acres (130 km2) of vineyards, a harvest of 120,000 short tons (109,000 t) of grapes, and exports going to more than forty countries around the world from the state's 600 wineries. By 2021, that number had grown to 1,050 wineries. While there are some viticultural activities in the cooler, wetter western half of the state, almost all (99%) of wine grape production takes place in the desert-like eastern half.[200] The rain shadow of the Cascade Range leaves the Columbia River Basin with around 8 inches (200 mm) of annual rain fall, making irrigation and water rights of paramount interest to the Washington wine industry. Viticulture in the state is also influenced by long sunlight hours (on average, two more hours a day than in California during the growing season) and consistent temperatures.[201]\n\nAs of 2022 , Washington has 108,542 total U.S. Department of Defense personnel, including active duty members of the military and civilian workers at United States Armed Forces bases.[202] It ranks seventh among states for most active duty personnel, at over 60,000, and seventeenth for reserve members.[203] The U.S. Navy and Marines comprise the largest branch in Washington with 45 percent of personnel, followed by the Army at 40 percent and the Air Force at 11 percent.[202] The state is also home to the 11th-largest population of retirees and veterans at over 560,000 as of 2019 .[204]\n\nThe state's largest military installations are centered around the Puget Sound region and include Joint Base Lewis–McChord in Pierce County, the largest military base on the West Coast with over 25,000 active duty soldiers;[205] Naval Station Everett in Snohomish County; and Naval Air Station Whidbey Island in Island County.[202][206] The Kitsap Peninsula is home to Naval Base Kitsap, which includes the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton and Naval Submarine Base Bangor,[206] site of the third-largest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world with more than 1,100 warheads for submarines.[207] Fairchild Air Force Base is a major air force installation near Spokane that has the largest aerial refueling fleet in the world.[208] Washington also has several major companies that serve as defense contractors for the U.S. military who were awarded $6.9 billion in fiscal year 2022. The largest contractors in the state include Boeing, PacMed, and Microsoft.[202][209]\n\nFrom 2009 to 2014, the Washington State Broadband Project was awarded $7.3 million in federal grants, but the program was discontinued in 2014.[210] For infrastructure, another $166 million has been awarded since 2011 for broadband infrastructure projects in Washington state.[211]\n\nU.S. News & World Report ranked Washington second nationally for household internet access, and sixth for online download speed, based on data from 2014 and 2015.[212]\n\nIn 2019, Washington State Legislature established the Washington State Broadband Office with two key mandates: high-speed internet access for 100% of WA residents by 2024 and an increase to 150/150 Mbit/s by 2028.[citation needed]\n\nIn March 2021, the Washington State Department of Commerce issued their first biennial report on the progress of these key mandates throughout 2020.[213]\n\nThe report includes five sections: public survey results, digital adoption disparities as they relate to federal census data, a Partner-Plan-Fund-Build-Adopt model for continued progress, success stories, and a policy discussion conclusion.\n\nAccording to the report, \"...over 42,000 survey responses from nearly 32,000 unique locations, showing that 6.4 percent of respondents reported having no broadband service, and 57 percent reported service at download speeds under 25 Mbps...\"\n\nWashington's state transportation system comprises several modes that are maintained by various government entities. The state highway system, called State Routes, includes over 7,000 miles (11,000 km) of roads and the Washington State Ferries system, the largest of its kind in the nation[214] and the third largest in the world. There are also 57,200 miles (92,100 km) of local roads maintained by cities and counties, as well as several ferries operated by local governments.[215] There are 140 public airfields in Washington, including 16 state airports owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation. Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (Sea–Tac) is the major commercial airport of greater Seattle.[216] Boeing Field in Seattle is one of the busiest primary non-hub airports in the U.S.[217]\n\nThere are extensive waterways around Washington's largest cities, including Seattle, Bellevue, Tacoma, and Olympia. The state highways incorporate an extensive network of bridges and the largest ferry system in the United States to serve transportation needs in the Puget Sound area. Washington's marine highway constitutes a fleet of twenty-eight ferries that navigate Puget Sound and its inland waterways to 20 different ports of call, completing close to 147,000 sailings each year. Washington is home to four of the five longest floating bridges in the world: the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge over Lake Washington, and the Hood Canal Bridge which connects the Olympic Peninsula and Kitsap Peninsula. Among its most famous bridges is the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which collapsed in 1940 and was rebuilt. Washington has 75 port districts,[215] including several major seaports on the Pacific Ocean. Among these are ports in Seattle, Tacoma, Kalama, Anacortes, Vancouver, Everett, Longview, Grays Harbor, Olympia, and Port Angeles.[citation needed] The Columbia and Snake rivers also provide 465 miles (748 km) of inland waterways that are navigable by barges as far east as Lewiston, Idaho.[215][218]\n\nThe Cascade Mountain Range also impedes transportation. Washington operates and maintains roads over seven[vague] major mountain passes and eight minor passes. During the winter months, some of these passes are plowed, sanded, and kept safe with avalanche control. Not all stay open through the winter. The North Cascades Highway, State Route 20, closes every year due to snowfall and avalanches in the area of Washington Pass. The Cayuse and Chinook passes east of Mount Rainier also close in winter.[219]\n\nWashington is crossed by several freight railroads, and Amtrak's passenger Cascade route between Eugene, Oregon, and Vancouver, BC is the eighth busiest Amtrak service in the U.S. Seattle's King Street Station, the busiest station in Washington, and the 15th busiest in the U.S.,[220] serves as the terminus for the two long-distance Amtrak routes in Washington, the Empire Builder to Chicago and the Coast Starlight to Los Angeles. The Sounder commuter rail service operates in Seattle and its surrounding cities, between Everett and Lakewood. The intercity network includes the Cascade Tunnel, the longest railroad tunnel in the United States, which is part of the Stevens Pass route on the BNSF Northern Transcom.[221]\n\nSound Transit Link light rail currently operates in the Seattle area at a length of 24 miles (39 km), and in Tacoma at a length of 4 miles (6.4 km). The entire system has a funded expansion plan that will expand light rail to a total of 116 miles by 2041. Seattle also has a 3.8-mile (6.1 km) streetcar network with two lines and plans to expand further by 2025. 32 local bus transit systems exist across the state,[215] the busiest being King County Metro, located in Seattle and King County, with just above 122 million riders in 2017.[222] Clark County has historically resisted proposals to extend Portland's MAX Light Rail into Vancouver, including the rejection of two ballot measures, but light rail is slated to be included in a future replacement of the Interstate Bridge.[223]\n\nSome tribal governments offer free bus service on their respective reservations, including on the Muckleshoot,[224] Spokane,[225] and Yakama Indian Reservations.[226]\n\nHanford Nuclear Reservation is currently the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States[227] and is the focus of the nation's largest environmental cleanup.[228] The radioactive materials are known to be leaking from Hanford into the environment.[229] Another major cleanup site is the Duwamish River basin in Seattle, among the most contaminated bodies of water in the United States due to industrial runoff.[230]\n\nIn 2007, Washington became the first state in the nation to target all forms of highly toxic brominated flame retardants known as PBDEs for elimination from the many common household products in which they are being used. A 2004 study of 40 mothers from Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Montana found PBDEs in the breast milk of every woman tested.\n\nThree recent studies by the Washington State Department of Ecology showed toxic chemicals banned decades ago linger in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs, dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE, dieldrin and PBDEs. As a result of the study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health advises the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also showed high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.[231]\n\nOn March 27, 2006, Governor Christine Gregoire signed into law the recently approved House Bill 2322. This bill would limit phosphorus content in dishwashing detergents statewide to 0.5 percent over the next six years. Though the ban would be effective statewide in 2010, it would take place in Whatcom County, Spokane County, and Clark County in 2008.[232] A recent discovery had linked high contents of phosphorus in water to a boom in algae population. An invasive amount of algae in bodies of water would lead to a variety of excess ecological and technological issues.[233]\n\nIn 2020, the electricity sold by public and private suppliers for use in Washington was primarily sourced from hydroelectric dams (55%), followed by natural gas (12%), coal (8.5%), wind (6%), and nuclear (4%). A total of 86.7 million Megawatt-hours of electricity was generated statewide in 2020.[234] Washington has the second-highest rate of renewable energy generation among U.S. states, behind Texas, and accounted for 31 percent of national hydroelectric generation.[235]\n\nWashington's executive branch is headed by a governor elected for a four-year term. The current statewide elected officials are:\n\nThe bicameral Washington State Legislature is the state's legislative branch. The state legislature is composed of a lower House of Representatives and an upper State Senate. The state is divided into 49 legislative districts of equal population, each of which elects two representatives and one senator. Representatives serve two-year terms, while senators serve for four years. There are no term limits. The Democratic Party has a majority in the House and Senate.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court is the highest court in the state and meets in Olympia. Nine justices serve on the bench and are elected statewide or appointed by the governor to fill vacancies.[236] There are 30 judicial districts, each with a superior court; these districts roughly correspond to counties, with some districts that combine rural or closely-related counties.[237]\n\nThe two current United States senators from Washington are Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, both Democrats. Murray has represented the state since 1993, while Cantwell assumed office in 2001. The state is one of four with two female senators.[238]\n\nWashington's ten representatives in the United States House of Representatives (see map of districts) as of the 2022 election are Suzan DelBene (D-1), Rick Larsen (D-2), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-3), Dan Newhouse (R-4), Michael Baumgartner (R-5), Emily Randall (D-6), Pramila Jayapal (D-7), Kim Schrier (D-8), Adam Smith (D-9), and Marilyn Strickland (D-10).\n\nDue to Congressional redistricting as a result of the 2010 census, Washington gained one seat in the United States House of Representatives. With the extra seat, Washington also gained one electoral vote, raising its total to 12.\n\nThe state is typically thought of as politically divided by the Cascade Mountains, with Western Washington being liberal (particularly the I-5 Corridor) and Eastern Washington being conservative.\n\nAlthough the eastern half of the state votes heavily Republican, the overwhelming Democratic dominance in the Seattle metropolitan area has turned Washington into a reliably blue state. It is considered part of the Blue wall of states that have voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1992. This voting streak began with Democrat Michael Dukakis narrowly capturing Washington in 1988. The state has since turned much more solidly blue, beginning with Obama's landslide victory in 2008, and Democrats winning the state by double digits in every subsequent presidential election.\n\nWashington was considered a key swing state in 1968, and it was the only western state to give its electoral votes to Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey over his Republican opponent Richard Nixon. Washington was considered a part of the 1994 Republican Revolution, and had the biggest pick-up in the house for Republicans, who picked up seven of Washington's nine House seats.[240] However, this dominance did not last for long, as Democrats picked up one seat in the 1996 election,[241] and two more in 1998, giving the Democrats a 5–4 majority.[242]\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, both houses of the Washington State Legislature (the Washington Senate and the Washington House of Representatives) were controlled by Democrats. The state senate was under Republican control, due to two Democrats' joining Republicans to form the Majority Coalition Caucus. After the 2014 elections, the Democrats retained control of the House, while Republicans took a majority in the Senate without the need for a coalition. In November 2017, a special election gave Democrats a one-seat majority in the Senate and complete control over state government. Since then, in the 2018 election, the Democrats have only expanded their majorities.\n\nThe governorship is currently held by Democrat Bob Ferguson. No state has gone longer without a Republican governor than Washington. Democrats have controlled the Washington Governor's Mansion for 40 years; the last Republican governor was John Spellman, who left office in 1985. Washington has not voted for a Republican senator, governor, or presidential candidate since 1994, tying with Delaware for the longest streak in the country.[243]\n\nWashington uses the non-partisan blanket primary system after the approval of Initiative 872 in 2004.[244] All candidates run on the same ballot during primary elections and the top two candidates advance to the general election in November, regardless of party affiliation. This has resulted in several same-party general election match-ups. In a 2020 study, Washington was ranked as the second easiest state for citizens to vote in.[245]\n\nThe 2023 American Values Atlas by the Public Religion Research Institute found that same-sex marriage is supported near-universally in Washington.[246]\n\nWashington is one of the ten states to have legalized assisted suicide. In 2008, the Washington Death with Dignity Act ballot initiative passed and became law.\n\nIn November 2009, Washington voters approved full domestic partnerships via Referendum 71, marking the first time voters in any state expanded recognition of same-sex relationships at the ballot box. Three years later, in November 2012, same-sex marriage was affirmed via Referendum 74, making Washington one of only three states to have approved same-sex marriage by popular vote.\n\nAlso in November 2012, Washington was one of the first two states to approve the legal sale and possession of cannabis for both recreational and medical use with Initiative 502. Although marijuana is still illegal under U.S. federal law, persons 21 and older in Washington state can possess up to one ounce of marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused product in solid form, 72 ounces of marijuana-infused product in liquid form, or any combination of all three, and can legally consume marijuana and marijuana-infused products.[247]\n\nIn November 2016, voters approved Initiative 1433, which among other things requires employers to guarantee paid sick leave to most workers. On January 1, 2018, the law went into effect, with Washington becoming the seventh state with paid sick leave requirements.[248]\n\nWith the passage of Initiative 1639 in the 2018 elections, Washington adopted stricter gun laws.\n\nWashington enacted a measure in May 2019 in favor of sanctuary cities, similar to California and Oregon laws which are among the strongest statewide mandates in the nation.[249]\n\nIn 2019, the legislature passed the Clean Energy Transformation Act, which requires all electricity sales to be from zero-carbon sources by 2045 and net-zero by 2030.[250]\n\nAs of the 2020–2021 school year, 1,094,330 students were enrolled in elementary and secondary schools in Washington, with 67,841 teachers employed to educate them.[251] As of August 2009, there were 295 school districts in the state, serviced by nine Educational Service Districts.[252] Washington School Information Processing Cooperative (a non-profit opt-in state agency) provides information management systems for fiscal and human resources and student data. Elementary and secondary schools are under the jurisdiction of the Washington State Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI).[253]\n\nHigh school juniors and seniors in Washington have the option of using the state's Running Start program. Begun by the state legislature in 1990, it allows students to attend institutions of higher education at public expense, simultaneously earning high school and college credit.[254] The state has 141 schools that offer dual language programs in 14 languages, primarily Spanish, beginning in kindergarten.[255]\n\nThe state also has several public arts-focused high schools including Tacoma School of the Arts, the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics, and The Center School. There are also four Science and Math based high schools: one in the Tri-Cities known as Delta, one in Tacoma known as SAMI, another in Seattle known as Raisbeck Aviation High School, and one in Redmond known as Tesla STEM High School.\n\nThere are more than 40 institutions of higher education in Washington. The state has major research universities, technical schools, religious schools, and private career colleges. Colleges and universities include the University of Washington, Seattle University, Washington State University, Western Washington University, Eastern Washington University, Central Washington University, Seattle Pacific University, Saint Martin's University, Pacific Lutheran University, Gonzaga University, University of Puget Sound, Evergreen State College, Whitman College, and Walla Walla University.\n\nAs of 2022 , Washington has 20 daily newspapers and 96 weekly newspapers that serve local and hyperlocal markets.[256] The most-circulated newspaper in the state is The Seattle Times, which is also among the most-circulated newspapers in the United States.[257] Other major daily newspapers include The Spokesman-Review in Spokane, The News Tribune in Tacoma, The Columbian in Vancouver, The Daily Herald in Everett, the Tri-City Herald in Kennewick, and the Kitsap Sun in Bremerton.[256] Several national and regional chains own and operate a number of local weekly newspapers, including the Adams Publishing Group,[258] Sound Publishing, The Seattle Times Company, and the McClatchy Company.[259] Free weekly newspapers include The Stranger, Seattle Weekly, and the Inlander.[259]: 18 The Seattle area also has a number of publications in English and other languages for ethnic communities, including the Seattle Chinese Post, International Examiner, and Northwest Asian Weekly.[260] Since 2004, Washington has lost 37 local newspapers and seen the consolidation of smaller papers, including neighborhood and suburban papers in the Seattle metropolitan area.[256][261] Several newspapers have also switched to online-only publication, including Seattle's morning daily Post-Intelligencer in 2009.[262]\n\nThe state is divided into four Designated Market Areas by Nielsen Media Research: Seattle–Tacoma, which also extends east to Wenatchee; Portland, which includes most of Southwestern Washington; Spokane, which also includes northern Idaho; and Yakima–Pasco–Richland–Kennewick.[263] The Seattle–Tacoma market is the largest in the Pacific Northwest and has been the 13th largest in the United States since 2009.[264] As of 2009 , Washington had 39 full-power television stations and an additional 11 from Portland, Oregon; most are affiliated with a national or regional broadcasting network.[265] The state is home to 383 stations licensed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[266][267] These radio stations broadcast to local markets as well as online, where Seattle-based music station KEXP-FM has found a worldwide following.[268]\n\nThe top two health insurers as of 2017 were Premera Blue Cross, with 24 percent market share, followed by Kaiser Permanente at 21 percent.[269] For the individual market, Molina Healthcare had the top share at 23%.[270]\n\nThe state adopted the Washington Healthplanfinder system in 2014 after the passage of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as \"ObamaCare\").[271] The system is used by approximately 90 percent of Washington residents who purchase or acquire their health insurance directly rather than through an employer.[272] The state's Medicaid program, named Washington Apple Health, provides healthcare coverage to people with disabilities or low incomes.[273]\n\nThe state of Washington reformed its health care system in 1993 through the Washington Health Services Act. The legislation required individuals to obtain health insurance or face penalties, and required employers to provide insurance to employees. In addition, health insurance companies were required to sell policies to all individuals, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and cover basic benefits.[274] The act was mostly repealed in 1995 before it could go into full effect.\n\nHospitals exist across the state, but many of Washington's best-known medical facilities are located in and around Seattle. The Seattle–Tacoma area has six major hospitals: Harborview Medical Center, University of Washington Medical Center, Seattle Children's, Swedish Medical Center, MultiCare Tacoma General Hospital, and St. Joseph Medical Center.[275] The Seattle-area hospitals are concentrated on First Hill, which is home to Virginia Mason Medical Center (the neighborhood has received the nickname \"Pill Hill\" owing to the high concentration of healthcare facilities).[276] As of 2023 , the state has over 14,000 total hospital beds that are licensed for acute care in 93 facilities. Several religious healthcare providers, primarily Catholic organizations, control 49 percent of the state's hospital beds and have acquired and consolidated major systems in Washington.[277]\n\nPickleball, a racquet sport invented on Bainbridge Island in 1965, was designated as Washington's official state sport in 2022.[278] For three years in a row, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the sport was named the fastest growing sport in the United States by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association (SFIA).[279]\n\nThe Seattle Open Invitational golf tournament was part of the PGA Tour from the 1930s to the 1960s. The GTE Northwest Classic was part of the Senior PGA Tour from 1986 to 1995, and the Boeing Classic since 2005. In addition, the 2015 U.S. Open was held at Chambers Bay, and several major tournaments were held at Sahalee Country Club.\n\nPacific Raceways is a motorsports venue that has hosted the Northwest Nationals of the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series and a round of the Trans-Am Series.\n\nThe WTA Seattle tennis tournament was part of the WTA Tour from 1977 to 1982.\n\nFour ships of the United States Navy, including two battleships, have been named USS Washington in honor of the state. Previous ships had held that name in honor of George Washington.[citation needed]\n\nThe state's nickname, \"The Evergreen State\",[1][280] was proposed in 1890 by Charles T. Conover of Seattle. The name proved popular as the forests were full of evergreen trees and the abundance of rain keeps the shrubbery and grasses green throughout the year.[281] Although the nickname is widely used by the state, appearing on vehicle license plates for instance, it has not been officially adopted.[1] A 2023 bill in the state legislature to formally recognize it as the state nickname was passed by the senate but was returned to committee.[282][283] The Evergreen State College, a state-funded institution in Olympia, also takes its name from this nickname.\n\nThe state song is \"Washington, My Home\", the state bird is the American goldfinch, the state fruit is the apple, and the state vegetable is the Walla Walla sweet onion.[284] The state dance, adopted in 1979, is the square dance. The state tree is the western hemlock. The state flower is the coast rhododendron. The state fish is the steelhead.[1] The state folk song is \"Roll On, Columbia, Roll On\" by Woody Guthrie. The unofficial, but popularly accepted, state rock song is \"Louie Louie\".[285] The state grass is bluebunch wheatgrass. The state insect is the green darner dragonfly. The state gem is petrified wood. The state fossil is the Columbian mammoth. The state marine mammal is the orca. The state soil is Tokul soil.[286] The state land mammal is the Olympic marmot.[1] The state seal (featured in the state flag as well) was inspired by the unfinished portrait of President George Washington by Gilbert Stuart.[287] The state sport is pickleball.[278]\n\nWashington has relationships with many provinces, states, and other entities worldwide.\n• None Hardina, Nicole (2020).

ContactarDenis Sassou Nguesso - Wikipedia: President of the Republic of the Congo (1979–1992, 1997–present)\n\nDenis Sassou Nguesso (born 23 November 1943) is a Congolese politician and former military officer who has served as president of the Republic of the Congo since 1997.[1] He also previously served as president from 1979 to 1992.\n\nSassou Nguesso headed the Congolese Party of Labour (PCT) for 12 years during his first period as president. His daughter Edith Lucie Bongo married Gabonese President Omar Bongo in 1989. He introduced multiparty politics in 1990, but was stripped of executive powers by the 1991 National Conference, remaining in office as a ceremonial head of state. He stood as a candidate in the 1992 presidential election but placed third.\n\nSassou Nguesso was an opposition leader for five years before returning to power during the Second Republic of the Congo Civil War, in which his rebel forces ousted President Pascal Lissouba.[2][3] Following a transitional period, he won the 2002 presidential election,[4] which involved low opposition participation. He was re-elected in the 2009 presidential election.[5] That same year his daughter and her husband Omar Bongo died.\n\nSassou Nguesso passed a new constitution via referendum in 2015 amidst calls for boycott then a dismissal of results by opposition leaders.[6][7][8] The new constitution enabled him to stand for another term. Sassou Nguesso was re-elected in the 2016 and 2021 presidential elections with a majority in the first round.[9]\n\nA member of the Mbochi tribe,[10] Sassou Nguesso was born in Edou in the Oyo district in northern Congo in 1943. His parents are Julien Nguesso and Émilienne Mouebara.[11] Nguesso was the youngest child in the family.[12] His father was a notable hunter chief in Edou.[13] He received primary education in Fort Rousset, now Owando. He studied in Dolisie Normal College between 1956 and 1960.[14]\n\nHe joined the army in 1960 just before the country was granted independence.[15] He received military training in Algeria. In 1962, he returned to Congo and was reassigned to active duty with the rank of second lieutenant. A year later, he joined the Application School for Infantry, at Saint-Maixent-l'École, France whence he graduated with the rank of lieutenant.[14] He returned to join Congo's elite paratroop regiment.[16] He was one of the first officers of the Airborne Group, the first paratroop battalion of the Congolese Army, which was created by Marien Ngouabi in 1965.[14][17] He commanded the Airborne Group, the army and the Brazzaville Military Zone (ZAB), and then headed the Intelligence department of the State Security Services. He became captain, then commander, and was promoted to colonel (1978) and later as army general (1989).[14]\n\nHe was part of the 1968 military coup that overthrew president Massemba Debat and brought Marien Ngouabi to power. He was a founding member of the National Revolution Council (Conseil National de la revolution) in December 1968.[18][19]\n\nIn 1968, Sassou Nguesso took part in the military coup led by Commander Marien Ngouabi against Debat: He was a member of the Congolese National Revolution Council (Conseil National de la révolution)[20] established on 5 August 1968.[21] Under the leadership of Marien Ngouabi, the group limited the president's powers, before the latter finally resigned on 3 September 1968.[22] Ngouabi officially became head of state in January 1969.[23]\n\nIn December 1969, Sassou Nguesso was elected as a member of the first central committee of the new Congolese Labor Party (Parti Congolais du travail, PCT). It was a communist party with a Marxist–Leninist doctrine. It was headed by Marien Ngouabi as president of the central committee, president of the republic and head of state.[24]\n\nA new constitution was issued on 31 December 1969, which designated the country as the People's Republic of Congo.[25]\n\nIn March 1970, following a failed coup attempted by Pierre Kinganga, a former lieutenant who was exiled in the neighboring Congo-Kinshasa,[26] an extraordinary session of the PCT's congress was held, during which Sassou Nguesso integrated the political bureau of the PCT.[27]\n\nOn 18 May 1973, Sassou Nguesso, who had been corps commander of the airborne group, was made Director of State Security.[28]\n\nIn 1975, amid an economic crisis, an extraordinary session of the PCT central committee was summoned. The eight members of the political bureau resigned and were replaced by a restricted \"Revolutionary Special General Staff\" (Etat major spécial révolutionnaire), composed of five members, including Sassou Nguesso, and headed by Marien Ngouabi.[27] At the end of the extraordinary session, Marien Ngouabi asked Sassou Nguessou and five other members for a report on the economic and political situation. The paper became known as the \"Declaration of 12 December 1975\". It recommended the \"radicalization\" of the revolution.[29]\n\nIn the same period, he was appointed Minister of Defense and Security at age 32.[30]\n\nOn 18 March 1977, president Marien Ngouabi was assassinated.[31] Official media stated that the assassination was conducted by a commando group led by Capt. Barthelemey Kikadidi.[32] Others claimed that the assassination was plotted by military officers within the close circle of power.[33][34]\n\nA Military Committee of the Congolese Labor Party (Comité militaire du PCT) composed of eleven officers and led by Major Sassou Nguesso immediately took power and repealed the 1973 constitution. Sassou Nguesso acted as interim head of state from 18 March to 6 April 1977, then he conceded his position to general Joachim Yhombi-Opango, who became president. Sassou Nguesso held the position of 1st vice president of the committee, while retaining his position of minister of defense.[31][35]\n\nShortly after the Ngouabi assassination, Massamba-Debat and his former prime minister Pascal Lissouba were arrested and accused by a courts-martial of plotting the assassination. Massamba-Debat was executed on 25 March 1977.[31][36] Sassou Nguesso was appointed provisional president on 8 February, before being confirmed, during a special congress on 31 March 1979 as head of the central committee, President of the Republic, head of state and President of the council of ministers, for five years.[35][37]\n\nOn 8 July 1979, general elections were held and confirmed the PCT as the dominant political force: the Congolese Labor Party won all the seats in the People's National Assembly.[38][39] A new constitution was adopted by referendum, confirming the socialist foundations of the country.[40]\n\nAs the newly elected president, Sassou Nguesso negotiated loans from the International Monetary Fund and allowed foreign investors from France and the Americas to conduct oil and mineral extraction.\n\nAlthough he was considered by French diplomats as representative of the radical wing of the PCT and as the Soviet Union and Cuba's man,[31] Sassou Nguessou developed and maintained strong relationships with France on which he relied to support the staggering economy. The French oil company Elf Aquitaine played an important role in the exploitation of Congolese oil fields that led to the doubling of oil production and in supporting Congolese government expenses via pre-financing loans.[41]\n\nHe visited France in October 1979 and in July 1981 to seek economic support. In October 1980, high-ranking French political figures including former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and former prime ministers Jacques Chirac and Pierre Messmer, were guests to the celebration of the Brazzaville centenary.[42]\n\nIn May 1980 Sassou Nguessou signed a twenty-year friendship pact with the Soviet Union and in the same year sent two delegations to China while a Chinese minister visited Brazzaville. However, the economic impact of these relationships remained marginal: France provided up to 50% of the country's foreign aid while the Soviet Union's contribution did not exceed 1.5%.\n\nSassou Nguesso was re-elected for a five-year term as President of the PCT Central Committee and President of the Republic at the party's Third Ordinary Congress on 27–31 July 1984,[43] He announced the release of Yhombi-Opango.[44] He served as Chairman of the Organization of African Unity from 1986 to 1987. In late 1987 he faced down a serious military revolt in the north of the country with French aid.\n\nAt the PCT's Fourth Ordinary Congress on 26–31 July 1989, Sassou Nguesso was re-elected as President of the PCT Central Committee and President of the Republic,[45] and the PCT won all of the seats of the People's National Assembly.[46] With the collapse of the socialist states of Eastern Europe, as well as influence from the French, Sassou Nguesso began to bring the country towards capitalism.[citation needed]\n\nIn December 1989 he announced the end of government control of the economy and declared a partial amnesty for political prisoners. Over the following year, he attempted to improve the failing economic situation and reduce the outrageous levels of corruption. Starting in September 1990 political parties other than the PCT were allowed and Sassou Nguesso made a symbolic state visit to the United States, laying the grounds for a new series of conditional International Monetary Fund loans later that year.[citation needed]\n\nHe introduced multiparty politics in 1990 and was then stripped of executive powers by the 1991 National Conference,[47] remaining in office as a ceremonial head of state. He stood as a candidate in the 1992 presidential election but placed third.[48]\n\nIn February 1991, a national conference began; the opposition gained control of the conference. The conference's declaration of its own sovereignty was not challenged by Sassou Nguesso. He was subjected to serious criticism and allegations during the Conference, including a claim from some delegates that he was involved in Ngouabi's assassination.[49][50]\n\nThe first round of elections took place on 24 June, and the second on 19 July. Senate elections took place on 26 July. In the parliamentary election of June–July 1992, the PCT won only 19 of 125 seats in the National Assembly; the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy (UPADS) led by former prime minister Pascal Lissouba, was the largest party. But it could not obtain an absolute majority in the National Assembly, with the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI) led by former army General Bernard Kolelas in second position.[51]\n\nIn the August 1992 presidential election, Sassou Nguesso was eliminated in the first round, placing third with 17% of the vote. He fared poorly everywhere except the north. The second round was held between Lissouba (UPADS) and Kolelas (MCDDI); Sassou Nguesso backed Lissouba, who won in the second round with 61.32% of the vote.[51]\n\nLissouba became President of the Republic on 31 August and a new Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Stephane Bongho-Nouarra of UPADS, was formed on 7 August. In the meantime, a new alliance of seven parties, including the MCDDI and the Rally for Democracy and Social Progress (RDPS) was constituted. It was soon joined by the PCT, which was unhappy with the distribution of ministerial portfolios, thus ensuring a new parliamentary majority.\n\nOn 31 October, the National Assembly approved a motion of no confidence against Bongho-Nouarra who resigned. On 17 November, President Lissouba dissolved Parliament, announcing elections to break the deadlock. In December, Claude Antoine Dacosta was appointed prime minister at the head of a transitional government.[51]\n\nCivil war started in November 1993, when the opposition parties (UDR and PCT) contested the results of the parliamentary elections (October 1993) giving victory to the coalition supporting President Lissouba (Tendance présidentielle).[52] Armed militia supporting President Lissouba (Cocoyes, Zoulous and Mambas) clashed with Kolelas' Ninjas and Sassous Nguesso's Cobras.[53] The conflict ended in December 1995, but left at least 2,000 dead and more than 100,000 displaced.[54]\n\nAfter this episode Sassou Nguesso spent seven months in Paris in 1996, returning on 26 January 1997 to contest the presidential election scheduled for July.[55]\n\nThe second round of the civil war erupted a few weeks before the presidential election.[56]\n\nIn May 1997, a visit by Sassou Nguesso to Owando, Yhombi-Opango's political stronghold, led to the outbreak of violence between his supporters and those of Yhombi-Opango.[57] On 5 June 1997, government forces surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home in the Mpila section of Brazzaville, attempting to arrest Pierre Aboya and Engobo Bonaventure, who had been implicated in the violence. Fighting broke out between government forces and Cobras, which led to the second civil war.\n\nAt the beginning of the conflict, Kolelas' militia remained neutral, but on 8 September 1997, he joined the president's camp and became prime minister.[58] On 18 September, Angolan troops and airforce entered the battle, providing significant support to Sassou Nguesso. By 14 October a final assault covered by Angolan MiG aircraft was launched on the Presidential Palace and neighborhoods in south Brazzaville,[57] then on Pointe Noire, against the President's militias (Zoulou, Cocoys, Aubervillois and Mambas) and the Ninjas.[59]\n\nBy October, Sassou Nguesso was in control, while Lissouba as well as Kolelas and Opango left the country. On 25 October 1997, Sassou Nguesso was sworn in.[55]\n\nHe repealed the 1992 Constitution, and replaced it with a \"Fundamental Act\" that concentrated power in the President's hands.[60] General Sassou Nguesso accumulated the functions of President of the Republic, Head of State, Head of Government, Minister of Defense and Supreme Chief of the Armies.[58]\n\nA government was announced on 2 November 1997; it consisted mainly of members and relatives of the FDU (Forces Démocratiques unifies, a coalition between the PCT and other parties supporting Sassou Nguesso) as well as two members respectively of UPADS and MCDDI, who were not chosen by the presidents in exile.\n\nHe also called for a National reconciliation forum. However, the idea was rejected by Lissouba's followers who continued to strike into the region between the country's economic capital, Pointe Noire and Brazzaville, having cut the railway between the coast and Brazzaville for three months. In December 1997 heavy fighting resumed in the capital's southern suburbs (the Pool area) where the Ninja militia clashed with Congolese and Angolan troops and Cobra militiamen. As many as 1,500 may have been killed in the fighting, and thousands more fled to escape the violence.[2]\n\nThe Forum for Unity and National Reconciliation was held from 5 to 8 January 1998 with 1,420 delegates. It decided upon a transitional period of three years, to be followed by elections under a new Constitution.[58] It also formed a 75-member National Transitional Council (NTC) to act as a legislative body. Members were elected by the forum by mid-January.[61] However, violence did not end. By April 1998, militias opposed to Sassou Nguesso operated throughout southern Congo, coordinating their operations. In the beginning of 1999, violence had resumed in Brazzaville.[2] Peace agreements were signed on 25 December under the auspices of President Omar Bongo of Gabon,[62] ending the civil war, leaving 8,000–10,000 dead, around 800,000 displaced persons and a devastated country.\n\nPresidential elections were held on 10 March 2002. 12 candidates entered the race, but only seven remained throughout the electoral process., Two candidates were disqualified by the Supreme Court on 10 February 2002 while two (Martin Mberi and General Anselme Makoumbou) withdrew from the race, on 6 March, protesting a lack of transparency in the electoral process. On 10 March, two days before the election, Andre Milongo, seen as the main challenger, withdrew, also citing a lack of transparency and calling for a boycott.[63]\n\nThe elections passed peacefully and Sassou Nguesso won with 89.41% of the votes. Serious malfunctions and acts of manipulation in a few electoral commissions were reported by the European Union Election Observation Mission, who reported that these acts did not impact the final result, and called for the sanction of those responsible in order to prevent the situation from happening again in the next elections.[64]\n\nSassou Nguesso was elected Chairman of the African Union, the OAU's successor body, in January 2006. His election was the result of a compromise reached to prevent the chairmanship from going to Omar al-Bashir.[65]\n\nSassou Nguesso was re-elected as President of the Central Committee of the PCT at the party's Fifth Extraordinary Congress in December 2006.[66] He was re-elected in the July 2009 presidential election with 78.61% of the vote amidst an opposition boycott. He said that his re-election meant continued \"peace, stability and security\", and he called for an end to \"thinking like ... freeloaders\" in reference to international aid. At his inauguration Sassou Nguesso announced that he would support an amnesty bill to pardon Lissouba, who had gone into exile after his 1997 ouster and was convicted of crimes in absentia. Sassou Nguesso said that he wanted the amnesty bill to be presented to Parliament by the end of 2009.[67] As Congo-Brazzaville prepared to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence from France in 2010, Sassou Nguesso noted that the country had far to go in fully realizing the dream of independence: \"Our country will not be totally independent until our people are free of the yoke of poverty.\"[68]\n\nOn 27 March 2015 Sassou Nguesso announced that his government would hold a referendum to change the 2002 constitution, which would allow him to run for a third consecutive term.[69] The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by voters, with 92.96% in favor. Turnout was officially placed at 72.44%.[70] However the opposition argued that due to low turnout, the results should be annulled.[71]\n\nOn 20 March 2016, Sassou Nguesso ran for a third consecutive term of 5 years and was reelected in the first round with 60% of the vote.[72]\n\nOpposition leader Guy-Brice Parfait Kolelas finished second with 15 percent of the vote while retired general Jean-Marie Mokoko, a former security adviser to Sassou Nguesso, came third with 14 percent.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the Republic, these elections were supervised by an independent commission (CNEI: Commission Nationale Electorale Indépendante). The opposition rejected the outcome, alleging fraud and calling for civil disobedience.[72]\n\nDuring the presidential election that took place on 21 March 2021, Sassou Nguessou, who faced six challengers for the presidency, came first once again, garnering 88.4% of the votes. His main challenger, Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas, finished second with 7.96%, Mathias Dzon received 1.92%, and the other four candidates each received less than 1% each.[73]\n\nIn December 2022, he attended the United States–Africa Leaders Summit 2022 in Washington, D.C. and met with US President Joe Biden.[74]\n\nIn July 2023, he attended the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in Saint Petersburg and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the summit, Nguesso called for peace in Ukraine.[75]\n\nAs the Chairman of the African Union High Level Committee on Libya, Sassou Nguesso stated, \"The settlement of the Libyan crisis appears, more than ever, as an absolute urgency\", especially because of the possible negative impact of terrorist groups in the south of Libya on neighboring states.\n\nHe declared \"this crisis remains, before any other consideration, an African problem.\"[76][77][78][79]\n\nIn September 2005, Sassou Nguesso and his entourage of more than fifty people stayed eight days at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, New York, for Sassou Nguesso to deliver a fifteen-minute speech to the United Nations General Assembly. The Sunday Times reported that the trip cost a total of US$295,000, with thousands of dollars spent on room service alone.[80] Sassou Nguesso was criticized by the Republic of Congo's creditors, as he was in negotiations with the World Bank and the UN International Monetary Fund to cancel Congolese debts, claiming inability to repay them.[80]\n\nIn July 2007, British NGO Global Witness published documents showing that the President's son, Denis-Christel Sassou Nguesso, may have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars from the country's oil sales on shopping sprees in Paris and Dubai. The documents show that in August 2006, Denis Christel, who was the head of Cotrade – the marketing branch of Congo's state oil firm SNPC – spent $35,000 on purchases from designers such as Louis Vuitton and Roberto Cavalli.[81] Reputation management company Schillings Solicitors unsuccessfully attempted to suppress this information.[82][citation needed]\n\nOn 30 November 2020, Sassou Nguesso and four ministers issued a decree terminating a contract with Australian mining company Sundance Resources to develop the Mbalam-Nabeba iron-ore deposit. Permits for the areas Avima, Nabeba and Bandodo were instead awarded to Sangha Mining Development, a subsidiary of Best Way Finance, a Hong Kong Corporation.[83][84][85]\n• Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n• Angola:\n• Recipient of the Order of Agostinho Neto (1992)\n• Benin:\n• Grand Cross of the National Order of Benin (2011) 86\n• Ivory Coast:\n• Grand Cross of the National Order of the Ivory Coast (2023) 87\n• Portugal:\n• Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (1984)\n• Senegal:\n• Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion (2022) 89\n• Togo:\n• Grand Cross of the Order of Mono (2011) 90\n• List of presidents of the Republic of the CongoDenis Sassou-Nguesso | Biography, Election, & Facts | Britannica: Denis Sassou-Nguesso (born 1943, Edou, Republic of the Congo) is a Congolese politician and former military leader who twice served as president of the Republic of the Congo (1979–92 and 1997– ).\n\nSassou-Nguesso attended Loubomo Secondary School from 1956 until 1961. He then joined the army, which sent him to Algeria and France for military training. In 1963 Sassou-Nguesso was appointed commander of military forces in Brazzaville and by the early 1970s had risen to the rank of colonel. During this time Sassou-Nguesso took an active role in politics. He joined the Congolese Labour Party (Parti Congolais du Travail; PCT), which embraced a Marxist-Leninist ideology and was designated the country’s sole ruling party in 1970. Sassou-Nguesso became a protégé of Pres. Marien Ngouabi (1968–77), who appointed him minister of defense in 1975. After Ngouabi was assassinated in 1977, Sassou-Nguesso’s rival within the PCT, Joachim Yhombi-Opango, came to power and appointed Sassou-Nguesso first vice president of the PCT’s military committee. Yhombi-Opango was forced to resign in February 1979, and the following month the PCT appointed Sassou-Nguesso president of the republic and head of the party.\n\nAlthough Sassou-Nguesso’s political roots were Marxist-Leninist in nature, as president he adopted a pro-Western approach when it was pragmatic to do so. The country initially enjoyed a period of relative stability under Sassou-Nguesso, and the PCT reelected him to the presidency in 1984 and again in 1989. In regional affairs, he was chosen to serve as chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1986–87. Falling oil prices in the 1980s contributed to a faltering economy and growing discontent in the country. In response, the PCT officially abandoned its Marxist-Leninist policies in 1990, a move that did not bode well for Sassou-Nguesso. The country’s first multiparty elections were held in August 1992. Sassou-Nguesso was eliminated in the first round of voting, and Pascal Lissouba of the Pan-African Union for Social Development (Union Panafricaine pour la Démocratie Sociale; UPADS) was elected president.\n\nAfter a brief alliance with UPADS that dissolved in late September, Sassou-Nguesso and the PCT allied itself with the Union for Democratic Renewal (Union pour le Renouveau Démocratique; URD), forming an opposition body and initiating acts of civil disobedience against Lissouba’s administration. In 1993 militias supportive of Sassou-Nguesso clashed with government forces, and escalating violence continued into the next year. Tensions between Sassou-Nguesso and Lissouba were never resolved, and violence between their militias erupted again in the months prior to the 1997 presidential and legislative elections, initiating a two-year civil war. In the fall of 1997, Lissouba was forced into exile and Sassou-Nguesso was once again declared president.\n\nAlthough a cease-fire was declared in 1999, Sassou-Nguesso was faced with the violence that persisted in some regions of the country. In addition, he was confronted with continued economic problems and with allegations of corruption within the government. In response, Sassou-Nguesso implemented a series of economic and political reforms to rebuild the country from bankruptcy and strengthen the democratic process, although the legitimacy of the democratic reform was often called into question by the opposition.\n\nSassou-Nguesso was reelected in 2002 in an election clouded by controversy. Some opposition candidates boycotted the race, claiming that democratic reform was still lacking and that the election would not be free and fair; as a result, Sassou-Nguesso faced no real competition, and the legitimacy of his overwhelming victory was disputed by the opposition. Despite the challenges to his leadership within the country, in 2006–07 Sassou-Nguesso was again tapped to serve in a regional position when he was named chairman of the African Union (AU), the successor of the OAU.\n\nIn December 2008 Sassou-Nguesso and Presidents Omar Bongo of Gabon and Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea were the target of a lawsuit that accused them of misuse of public funds, embezzlement, and money laundering in connection with a luxury property in France. The controversy surrounding the allegations brought forth by the lawsuit seemed to have little bearing on Sassou-Nguesso as he prepared for the July 12, 2009, presidential election. As in 2002, the election was again boycotted by the main opposition candidates, and Sassou-Nguesso was reelected by a wide margin of victory. Although the opposition and some organizations claimed that there were incidents of fraud and intimidation, international observers from the AU declared the election free and fair.\n\nAlthough Sassou-Nguesso was barred by the constitution from standing for another term as president, steps were set in motion to work around that limitation. A proposal to amend the constitution to eliminate term limits and raise the maximum age for a presidential candidate—changes that would allow Sassou-Nguesso to stand for another presidential term—was put to referendum in October 2015. The opposition boycotted the referendum, but officials reported that almost three-fourths of registered voters turned out to vote, and 92 percent indicated that they were in favour of the proposal.\n\nSassou-Nguesso was indeed the PCT’s candidate in the March 20, 2016, presidential election, which took place amid a much-criticized communications blackout. Sassou-Nguesso was victorious, with officials claiming that he won about 60 percent of the vote; this was disputed by the opposition. He was reelected in March 2021, reportedly with more than 88 percent of the vote, although amid some of the same circumstances as in 2016: the main opposition boycotted the election, Internet service in the country was shut down, the outcome was disputed, and there were allegations of fraud.Denis Sassou-Nguesso — Wikipédia: Denis Sassou-Nguesso, né le 23 novembre 1943 à Edou[1], est un militaire et homme d'État congolais. Président de la république populaire du Congo de 1979 à 1992, il est l'actuel président de la république du Congo depuis 1997, après avoir renversé le président élu Pascal Lissouba dans les premiers mois de la guerre civile du Congo-Brazzaville[2].\n\nDenis Sassou-Nguesso est né en 1943 à Edou, petit village aux environs d'Oyo, dernier enfant d'une fratrie dont le père est Julien Nguesso et la mère Émilienne Mouebara (morte en 1982)[3],[1]. Il est marié à Antoinette Tchibota[4] et père de plusieurs enfants, issus de plusieurs femmes. On lui dénombre plus de 25 enfants avec plusieurs femmes dans des liaisons hors mariage.\n\nIl est élève à l'école primaire d'Édou, puis d'Owando, alors appelé Fort-Rousset. De 1956 à 1960, il est élève au collège normal de Dolisie (Mbounda) pour devenir instituteur[5].\n\nAprès l'obtention de son brevet, il passe avec succès un concours de sélection d'élèves-officiers de réserve. En 1961, il suit la préparation militaire supérieure à Bouar en Centrafrique, avant la formation de l'École interarmes des officiers de réserve de Cherchell en Algérie[6].\n\nRentré au Congo en 1962, il est reversé dans le cadre des officiers d'active avec le grade de sous-lieutenant. L'année suivante, il intègre l'École d'application de l'infanterie de Saint-Maixent-l'École. Il en sort avec le grade de lieutenant et devient parachutiste[7].\n\nIl est l'un des premiers officiers du groupement aéroporté[8], premier bataillon parachutiste de l'armée congolaise, créé en 1965 sous le commandement du capitaine Marien Ngouabi[9].\n\nDe 1968 à 1975, il commande successivement le groupement aéroporté, les forces terrestres et la zone militaire de Brazzaville (ZAB), puis dirige la Sécurité d'État (services de renseignement du Congo). Il devient capitaine[10], puis commandant. Il deviendra par la suite colonel[réf. nécessaire][11].\n\nÀ partir du milieu des années 1960, Sassou-Nguesso est dans la mouvance des officiers progressistes conduite par Marien Ngouabi, qui mène une fronde sourde contre le pouvoir de Massamba-Débat. Le 2 août 1963 l'Armée prend le pouvoir et le 16 août [12] un Conseil national de la révolution (CNR) est créé et investi de l'essentiel des pouvoirs. Il est dirigé par Ngouabi et Sassou-Nguesso en est l'un des trente-neuf membres[13],[14].\n\nLe , il fait partie des membres fondateurs du Parti congolais du travail (PCT)[15], nouveau parti unique d'idéologie marxiste-léniniste, au pouvoir sous le nouveau régime de la république populaire du Congo[16]. Il devient membre du bureau politique après le congrès extraordinaire du PCT de .\n\nLa session extraordinaire du comité central du PCT qui se tient du 5 au met en évidence de fortes contradictions internes au sein du parti unique. Plusieurs décisions importantes sont prises. Joachim Yhombi-Opango, Martin M'beri et d'autres membres sont exclus du comité central. Le bureau politique est dissous et un état-major spécial révolutionnaire de cinq membres est institué. Il en reprend les pouvoirs jusqu'au prochain congrès extraordinaire du PCT. Sassou-Nguesso en est un des cinq membres[10], avec Marien Ngouabi, Jean-Pierre Thystère-Tchicaya, Louis Sylvain-Goma et Jean-Pierre Ngombé. Louis Sylvain-Goma est nommé Premier ministre en remplacement d'Henri Lopes.\n\nLe 28 décembre sur délégation du Conseil d'État, exécutif de la République qui réunit l'EMSR et d'autres corps constitués, il est nommé ministre de la Défense et de la Sécurité par décret présidentiel.\n\nLe 2 avril 1977, Sassou-Nguesso prononce l'oraison funèbre de Marien Ngouabi. Le 3 avril, le Comité militaire du parti (CMP) promulgue un acte fondamental qui abroge la Constitution de 1973. Sa structure définitive est rendue publique : Yhombi-Opango en est le président, et de droit président de la république du Congo. Sassou-Nguesso est le Premier vice-président, chargé de la coordination des organisations de masses du parti. Louis Sylvain-Goma, deuxième vice-président du CMP, est nommé Premier ministre et forme un gouvernement dans lequel Sassou-Nguesso conserve le poste de ministre de la Défense.\n\nÀ partir du deuxième semestre de l'année 1978, il entre en conflit larvé avec Yhombi-Opango, cultivant dans l'opinion l'image d'un homme simple, affable, proche du peuple et fidèle à la ligne de Marien Ngouabi. La crise culmine avec la diffusion par le capitaine Pierre Anga, partisan de Yhombi-Opango au sein du CMP, d'un document intitulé « Ce qui nous divise et les moyens de conjurer une crise dans un processus révolutionnaire » qui impute au ministre de la Défense les défaillances de la sécurité présidentielle de Ngouabi au moment de l'attentat et l'accuse de manœuvres pour saper l'autorité du président du CMP. Sassou-Nguesso exige et obtient la suspension du capitaine Anga pour diffamation[17].\n\nEn 1979 Yhombi-Opango, mis en minorité, est contraint d'accepter la dissolution du CMP et la fin de son mandat à la tête de la République[18].\n\nEn mars 1979 le Parti congolais du Travail élit le Colonel Denis Sassou-Nguesso président de son comité central, et de droit président de la République pour cinq ans. Louis Sylvain-Goma est nommé Premier ministre, et conserve lui-même le poste de ministre de la Défense. Le 8 juillet, il fait adopter par référendum une nouvelle Constitution[19].\n\nLa mise en production de nouveaux gisements pétroliers en 1981 et 1982 (Yanga, Sendji) accroît significativement les recettes de l'État et procure une prospérité certaine au pays. Le gouvernement porte l'âge de la retraite de 50 à 55 ans[20], augmente légèrement les salaires des fonctionnaires et la bourse des étudiants et lance un plan quinquennal de développement ambitieux (1982-1986)[21]. Celui-ci vise à aménager le territoire et permettre le décollage économique du pays. Plusieurs routes et ponts sont construits, ainsi que de nombreux édifices publics dans les principales villes du pays. Les entreprises publiques reçoivent d'importantes subventions pour assurer leur relance. La CORAF, raffinerie nationale, entre en production en 1982[22].\n\nSes rapports avec la France sont amicaux, tant avec le gouvernement de Giscard d'Estaing qu'avec celui de Mitterrand. Les gisements pétroliers sont exploités par la compagnie française Elf qui n'a à reverser au Congo que 17 % des revenus déclarés du brut[23].\n\nÀ mi-parcours, la chute des cours du pétrole conduit à l'abandon de plusieurs projets inscrits dans le plan. Dans le domaine économique, les résultats sont mitigés, la plupart des entreprises peinant à être rentables. En outre, la politique de grands travaux publics a eu pour effet, l'aggravation des pratiques de corruption. L'État qui a financé le plan quinquennal par l'endettement extérieur, fondé sur les espérances des recettes pétrolières futures, a du mal à supporter le service de la dette.\n\nLe congrès ordinaire du PCT de 1984 réélit Sassou-Nguesso à la tête du pays pour cinq années. Il assume également les fonctions de chef du gouvernement et de ministre de la Défense. Le numéro deux du régime, Thystère-Tchicaya, est démis de ses fonctions et mis en résidence surveillée[24]. Le président nomme Ange Édouard Poungui Premier ministre[25].\n\nEn 1985-1986, sous la pression des institutions de Bretton Woods, il adopte un programme d'ajustement structurel (PAS), avec le gel des avancements et des recrutements dans la fonction publique. Certains monopoles d'État sont supprimés. Il obtient un ainsi un rééchelonnement des dettes vis-à-vis de ces institutions. Un accord de rééchelonnement de la dette est également signé avec le Club de Paris[26]. En , il promulgue le Code de la famille, combinaison du Code civil et des différents usages coutumiers[27],[28].\n\nEn , il est élu à la tête de l'Organisation de l'unité africaine pour une année, dans une période marquée par l'engagement de l'OUA contre l'apartheid et en faveur de la libération de Nelson Mandela[29].\n\nEn juillet 1987, un « complot » contre Sassou-Nguesso est découvert et l'ancien président Yhombi-Opango, libéré trois ans plus tôt, est arrêté, ainsi que d'autres personnalités militaires et civiles, de l'ethnie kouyou pour la plupart : (Henri Eboundit, Jean-Michel Ebaka, Lecas Atondi-Momondjo, etc.). Ils sont accusés d'atteinte à la sûreté de l'État. L’ancien aide de camp de Marien Ngouabi, Pierre Anga, niant toute implication, se réfugie dans la forêt proche d'Ikonongo et entre en rébellion à Owando, dans le nord du pays. Il est abattu un an plus tard par l'armée. La traque d'Anga s'accompagne de grandes brutalités sur les habitants du pays kouyou de la part des militaires[30].\n\nEn se tient le congrès ordinaire du PCT. Sassou-Nguesso est reconduit à la tête du parti et de l'État pour cinq ans. Il conserve les fonctions de chef du gouvernement et de ministre de la Défense[ souhaitée]. Il nomme Alphonse Souchlaty-Poaty, au poste de Premier ministre.,[31]\n\nEn , le président monte une commission ad hoc chargée de réfléchir aux changements en cours dans les pays d'Europe de l'Est et leurs implications au niveau national. En , l'ancien Premier ministre Poungui démissionne du PCT. En , lors du sommet France-Afrique à La Baule, François Mitterrand invite les dirigeants africains à libéraliser la vie politique et annonce que l'aide française sera désormais assujettie aux efforts de démocratisation de chaque pays africain.\n\nDébut , le comité central du PCT décide de la séparation du parti et de l'État, définit le multipartisme comme un objectif à atteindre après une phase de transition[32].\n\nLe congrès de la Confédération syndicale congolaise (CSC) de s'ouvre sur la déclaration d'indépendance du syndicat unique vis-à-vis du PCT. Les délégués réclament la hausse des salaires, ainsi que le dégel des avancements dans la fonction publique, et s'invitent sur le champ politique en exigeant une ouverture démocratique immédiate. Il suspend alors le congrès de la CSC et en dissout le comité directeur. Il constitue un directoire provisoire, qui a à sa tête Simon-Pierre Gouoniba-Nsari. Le secrétaire général de la CSC, Jean-Michel Bokamba-Yangouma, réplique en appelant les travailleurs à une grève générale. Celle-ci est suivie par tous. Sassou-Nguesso demande à l'armée de mater les dirigeants syndicaux, mais il se heurte au refus du général Mokoko, chef d'état-major général des FAC. Au bout de trois jours de paralysie générale du pays, il est contraint de céder. La CSC peut reprendre son congrès et le pouvoir lui donne satisfaction sur toutes ses revendications.\n\nSous la pression, le PCT annonce en septembre l'instauration immédiate du multipartisme[33] et la prochaine convocation d'une conférence des partis. Il annonce un congrès extraordinaire du parti unique en décembre pour entériner la nouvelle donne[34]. Une loi sur les partis, autorisant la création d'autres partis politiques, est votée par l'Assemblée nationale.\n\nDans les mois qui suivent la libéralisation de la vie publique, et surtout en 1992, une multitude de partis et associations politiques sont créées[35]. Aussi bien par les opposants de longue date que par des personnalités qui, précipitamment, prennent leurs distances avec le PCT. La contestation sociale grandit et des grèves sectorielles éclatent dans le pays, affectant à la fois l'économie et l'administration (industrie pétrolière, transport, écoles, université, etc). Plusieurs journaux privés voient le jour, dont beaucoup se positionnent contre Sassou-Nguesso et le PCT. L'impopularité du président atteint des sommets dans l'opinion.\n\nEn le congrès extraordinaire du PCT met fin officiellement à la primauté du parti sur l'État et abandonne le marxisme-léninisme comme idéologie[36]. Alphonse Souchlaty-Poaty, en séjour en France, démissionne de son poste de Premier ministre. Pierre Moussa, ministre du Plan est désigné pour assurer la vacance[37].\n\nLe , Sassou-Nguesso nomme Louis Sylvain-Goma Premier ministre et le charge de former un gouvernement d'union nationale pour assurer la transition vers la démocratie et préparer une conférence des partis chargée d'élaborer une nouvelle constitution. Devant le refus de la classe politique à souscrire à cette démarche, il s'incline et annonce la convocation d'une conférence nationale. L'équipe gouvernementale sortante est reconduite pour gérer les affaires courantes. Dans le courant du mois de janvier, le général Yhombi-Opango est indemnisé pour l'expropriation de ses biens personnels lors de sa chute en 1979. Il reçoit près d'un milliard de francs CFA.\n\nLa Conférence nationale se tient du 25 février au 10 juin, réunissant 1 100 personnes (représentants des partis et associations politiques).\n\nEn août 1991, il doit digérer l'arrestation de son frère Maurice Nguesso et de Justin Lékoundzou Itihi Ossetoumba, ancien ministre des Finances, pour détournement de l'argent public. La déstabilisation d'André Milongo par le Haut commandement militaire en janvier 1992 lui est imputée par l'opinion publique. La médiation du président du Conseil supérieur de la République, Nkombo, permet de maintenir le gentlemen's agreement (« accord de gentilshommes, accord civique »)[10].\n\nEn mars 1992, la nouvelle Constitution est massivement adoptée par référendum. Elle entérine la démocratie multipartite dans le pays et instaure un régime semi-parlementaire concentré autour de trois organes politiques : le président de la République, le Premier ministre et le Parlement bicaméral. Le président de la République est élu pour 5 ans au suffrage universel direct, rééligible une fois[10].\n\nLes élections locales et législatives de 1992 relèguent le PCT au rang de troisième force politique du pays, derrière l'Union panafricaine pour la démocratie sociale de Pascal Lissouba et le Mouvement congolais pour la démocratie et le développement intégral de Bernard Kolélas. À l'élection présidentielle, Denis Sassou-Ngesso est aussi en troisième position, avec 16,9 % des voix[1].\n\nEn position d'arbitre pour le second tour, il s'accorde avec Lissouba pour le deuxième tour de la présidentielle et leurs partis respectifs signent un accord de gouvernement. Le chef de l'UPADS arrivé en tête au premier tour avec plus de 39 % de voix, l'emporte nettement au deuxième tour[réf. nécessaire].\n\nL'accord de gouvernement conclu avec le parti de Pascal Lissouba (UPDS) ne convient finalement pas au parti de Denis Sassou-Nguesso, et après des élections législatives anticipées, dont les résultats sont contestés par l'opposition, des conflits armés opposent les milices armées par les différents partis se muent en guerre civile[1].\n\nDenis Sassou-Nguesso, soutenu par la France, s'y exile pour deux ans[1],[38].\n\nLe , il revient au Congo. À Brazzaville comme à Pointe-Noire, il est accueilli avec ferveur par des foules immenses. Il s'attelle à la préparation de la campagne présidentielle et entreprend une tournée à travers le pays. L'escale d'Owando donne lieu à un épisode tragique, le 10 mai. Avant son arrivée dans la ville, Jacques Okoko député du Rassemblement pour le développement et la démocratie d'Owando décrète qu'il n'est pas question que Sassou-Nguesso soit porté en tipoye dans la ville. La tension monte. Des partisans du RDD tentent de perturber la parade de Sassou-Nguesso à travers la ville. L'incident se termine par la mort d'un militaire, abattu par la garde de Sassou-Nguesso. Après le départ de celui-ci, ses partisans sont pris à partie et doivent fuir Owando. On dénombre huit morts. Le , un code de bonne conduite est signé par l'ensemble de la classe politique congolaise sous l'égide de Federico Mayor, directeur général de l'UNESCO. Le 2 juin, 4 militaires de l'entourage de Yhombi-Opango sont attaqués et tués par les cobras milice de Sassou-Nguesso dans les environs d'Oyo. Le climat est tendu dans le pays.\n\nAux premières heures du jour, le , un détachement militaire lourdement armé encercle la résidence privée de Sassou-Nguesso dans le quartier de Mpila. S'estimant menacé, celui-ci réplique et ouvre le feu immédiatement. Au cours de la journée, le ministre de l'Intérieur, Philippe Bikinkita, justifie le déploiement militaire autour de la résidence de Sassou-Nguesso et le présente a posteriori comme étant une simple opération de police visant l'arrestation de Pierre Aboya, officier impliqué dans la fusillade d'Owando qui aurait trouvé refuge chez l'ancien président. Peu d'observateurs jugent crédible la justification du gouvernement. Cependant, Le général Sassou-Nguesso est dans un état de préparation inattendu, mobilisant très rapidement de nombreux miliciens (les cobras) et soldats en rupture, dotés d'un armement neuf, abondamment pourvus en munitions et encadrés par des officiers expérimentés de l'armée régulière. En quelques heures, les forces de Sassou-Nguesso repoussent la force publique et établissent leurs positions. Dans les jours qui suivent, le gouvernement fait intervenir toutes les forces fidèles disponibles (soldats de l'armée régulières et miliciens zoulous et cocoyes) et la capitale devient le siège de violents combats. Plusieurs civils pris entre deux feux sont tués. Les populations doivent évacuer les quartiers de Poto-Poto et Moungali et le centre-ville. L'armée française exfiltre les ressortissants étrangers.\n\nSi le gouvernement de Lionel Jospin tient à la neutralité officielle de la France dans la guerre civile congolaise, la Françafrique penche majoritairement pour son vieil affilié Denis Sassou Nguesso. On a déjà signalé l’intervention à ses côtés de la PME embarbouzée Geolink (Billets 48), qui procura des mercenaires à Mobutu. Si ce n’est pas elle, c’est une sœur qui a procuré les « deux hélicoptères en pièces détachées qui seront montés par des mercenaires ukrainiens », dont le ministre Charles Josselin a parlé à l'Assemblée (29 juin 1997)[réf. nécessaire]. Selon Le Canard enchaîné (9 juillet 1997), un homme d'affaires chiraquien et un haut responsable d’Elf procurent des armes à N’Guesso via l’Angola. Selon La Lettre du Continent, même des conseillers élyséens se sont mis en recherche d’« instructeurs » pour ce dernier (19 juin 1997). Lequel maintient d’étroits contacts avec l'Angola et l’ex-ennemi no 1 de la « Françafrique », Kabila. Mais Lissouba (comme Patasse) s’est rendu à Kinshasa pour tenter d’inverser la vapeur. Pendant ce temps, Omar Bongo, ami de Chirac et obligé d’Elf, préside le Comité international de médiation chargé de dénouer la crise congolaise.\n\nLe président Lissouba s'est rendu peu populaire dans les milieux dirigeants politiques en France à la suite de sa décision d’augmenter les redevances de Elf sur les revenus du pétrole et de se tourner vers le groupe américain Occidental Petroleum. Ainsi, note le chercheur Etanislas Ngodi, « Bongo, Elf par l’intermédiaire d'André Tarallo, le réseau Foccart (Maurice Robert) et celui de Pasqua par l’intermédiaire de Daniel Léandri et Jean-Charles Marchani, complotent pour renverser Pascal Lissouba. » Jacques Chirac prend le parti de Sassou-Nguesso et le reçoit secrètement à l’Élysée en compagnie d’Omar Bongo. Si la marge de manœuvre du président français est limitée du fait de la cohabitation avec le premier ministre Jospin, enclin à la neutralité, il assure à son hôte que Paris ne s'opposera pas à son retour au pouvoir. Le journaliste Claude Angeli révèle le cas d'un chargement de vingt-cinq tonnes de fret envoyé du Bourget sous couvert de la « présidence du Gabon » aux milices de Sassou Nguesso[23].\n\nUne médiation nationale est montée, dirigée par Bernard Kolélas, et tente d'établir le dialogue entre le président Pascal Lissouba et Sassou-Nguesso. Cette entreprise n'obtient aucun résultat concret. Après les premières semaines de combat, la guerre s'enlise et chaque faction campe sur ses positions. De part et d'autre, les combattants se livrent au pillage dans les maisons et commerces désertés. Au mois de , Lissouba nomme Bernard Kolélas au poste de Premier ministre et celui-ci engage sa milice dans le conflit.\n\nUne médiation internationale tente de ramener la paix au Congo. Omar Bongo invite les deux belligérants à Libreville afin de mettre sur pied un schéma de sortie de crise. Plusieurs chefs d'État africains participent au sommet. Pascal Lissouba ne s'y rend pas et délègue Kolélas. La conférence n'a guère de résultats concrets.\n\nLe 15 octobre 1997, l'armée angolaise s'engage dans le conflit aux côtés de Sassou-Nguesso et fait pencher la balance en sa faveur. Le 15 octobre, les forces de Lissouba sont défaites. Pascal Lissouba et ses proches quittent le pays. Les forces de Sassou-Nguesso, appuyées, outre l'armée angolaise, par des soldats tchadiens et des mercenaires rwandais, contrôlent les principales villes du pays. Le nombre de morts de la guerre civile est estimé à environ 400 000. Des massacres sont perpétrés, en particulier dans la région du Pool.\n\nDans une capitale ravagée par quatre mois d'un conflit violent, les problèmes à régler sont multiples (pénuries diverses, sécurité, remise en état des infrastructures publiques, remise en route des administrations, etc.). Progressivement, le gouvernement reconstruit la capitale.\n\nÀ partir du milieu de l'année 1998, il doit faire face à une montée de la violence dans la région du Pool. Les miliciens « ninjas » de Kolélas font montre d'une recrudescence d'activités subversives, sous la conduite du pasteur Ntumi. Dès le mois d'août 1998, ils arrêtent le trafic ferroviaire dans le Pool. Le , ils tentent d'investir Brazzaville. La région du Pool est aujourd'hui dévastée[39].\n\nAprès plusieurs centaines de morts, c'est au prix de négociations avec les chefs de guerre que le gouvernement parviendra à normaliser la situation dans cette zone. La rébellion de Ntumi, quoique de moins en moins virulente, reflue et finit par s'incruster dans la zone Kindamba[40].\n\nEn 2000, Sassou-Nguesso fait juger par contumace les principaux dignitaires du régime de Lissouba pour des motifs divers (crimes économiques ou actes de torture). Lissouba, Yhombi-Opango, Kolélas, Moungounga-Kombo Ngila, Benoit Koukébéné, etc., sont condamnés à de lourdes peines.\n\nAu début des années 2000, l'industrie pétrolière congolaise retrouve un second souffle avec la mise en production de quelques gisements (Kombi-Likalala, Tchibeli, Bondi). Par ailleurs, les contrats de partage de production, en vigueur depuis 1995 accordent à l'État une plus grande part dans la répartition de la rente pétrolière. Le gouvernement essaye de remettre en état la voie ferrée Brazzaville – Pointe-Noire mais n'y parvient pas à cause des ninjas dans le Pool et des milices armées le long du chemin de fer, et les militaires fanatiques (cobras) dans les trains qui sèment la terreur. La SNPC, créée en 1999 sur les cendres d'Hydro Congo pour gérer les hydrocarbures, commercialise elle-même le brut de l'État. La nouvelle poussée des cours du brut accroît les recettes budgétaires. Le traitement des ministres est porté à 4 millions de FCFA par mois et celui des parlementaires à 2 millions. La rémunération des magistrats aussi est significativement améliorée. Cependant, les grilles salariales en vigueur depuis le milieu des années 1960 restent inchangées pour les agents publics.\n\nEn 2017, la station de radio publique RFI le classe dans son « top 10 des chefs d'État à la plus forte longévité » en troisième position dans le monde et premier en Afrique avec « 33 ans de magistrature suprême », soulignant qu'il est « souvent oublié dans les palmarès des chefs d’Etat ayant le plus longtemps exercé le pouvoir »[41]. Selon Le Monde, il pourrait rester au pouvoir jusqu'en 2031[42].\n\nEn 2002, Sassou-Nguesso fait adopter par référendum une nouvelle constitution. Elle garantit les libertés fondamentales. Un régime de type présidentiel est instauré. La durée du mandat du président de la République est fixée à sept ans et l'élection se déroule au suffrage universel direct. L'âge limite pour la candidature à la magistrature suprême est de 70 ans. Le gouvernement est dirigé par le chef de l'État[43].\n\nL'élection présidentielle se tient en mars 2002. Un seul des candidats que Denis Sassou-Nguesso doit affronter, André Milongo, jouit d'une réelle notoriété. À deux jours du scrutin, l'ancien Premier ministre retire sa candidature, arguant que les jeux sont faits d'avance. Sassou-Nguesso est élu très confortablement au premier tour à la suite d'élections très contestées par l’opinion internationale ainsi que congolaise.\n\nSon mandat s'ouvre sous le slogan de la « Nouvelle espérance ». De grands chantiers sont entamés à travers le pays, sous la conduite de la délégation aux grands travaux. Une municipalisation accélérée des principales localités du pays est lancée. Elle est censée moderniser les villes du Congo.\n\nAu cours des années suivantes, deux initiatives gouvernementales provoquent un malaise dans l'opinion. En 2005, c'est la régate dénommée Route de l'Équateur organisée par le Congo entre Marseille et Pointe-Noire alors que les Congolais manquent de tout (médicaments, denrées alimentaires, eau, électricité, etc.). Elle coûte officiellement 4 milliards de FCFA. En 2006, c'est la construction d'un mausolée à la gloire de Savorgnan de Brazza à un coût supérieur à 10 milliards de FCFA.\n\nEn 2006, Sassou-Nguesso assure pour un an la présidence de l'Union africaine, à la suite d'un compromis pour éviter que le poste ne soit occupé par Omar el-Béchir, président du Soudan mais poursuivi par la Cour pénale internationale pour crimes de guerre.\n\nEn 2007, l'âge de la retraite est porté de 55 à 60 ans et le salaire minimum est rehaussé de 35 000 à 40 000 FCFA (environ 7 euros de plus). La portée sociale de ces mesures est cependant limitée. En dépit des slogans, le Congo recule en termes d'indice de développement humain. L'appauvrissement des populations, débutée à la fin des années 1980, continue de s'accentuer. 70 % des Congolais vivent sous le seuil de pauvreté (moins de 1 dollar US par jour). Dans le même temps, une petite catégorie de gens, principalement des membres de l'élite au pouvoir, s'enrichit ostensiblement. La corruption dans la fonction publique s'aggrave, profitant notamment aux agents des douanes et des autres régies financières, ainsi qu'aux agents de la police qui en viennent à arrêter des véhicules sans motifs valables, uniquement pour demander de l'argent. En 2010, Denis Sassou Nguesso s’engage lors d’une conférence de presse à procéder à des réformes et à lutter contre la corruption, ce qui retient l’attention des Conseils d’administration de la Banque mondiale et du Fonds monétaire international, qui acceptent en conséquence le dossier de la république du Congo relatif à l’allègement de la dette[44].\n\nSur le plan de la politique intérieure, alors qu'une information judiciaire est ouverte en France pour l'affaire des disparus du Beach, la cour criminelle de Brazzaville ouvre en 2005, le procès de plusieurs officiers de haut rang sur les mêmes chefs d'accusation. Au terme des débats, tous les accusés sont acquittés. Sassou-Nguesso fait amnistier ses adversaires politiques en exil, condamnés quelques années auparavant. Les uns après les autres, ceux-ci regagnent le Congo.\n\nEn , lors de l'enterrement de Jean-Pierre Thystère-Tchicaya à Pointe-Noire, des émeutes éclatent et les manifestants s'en prennent ouvertement à Sassou. En juin 2009, lors des élections locales, la participation ne dépasse pas les 5 %. Le RMP (rassemblement pour la majorité présidentielle), nouveau parti destiné à soutenir la candidature de Sassou-Nguesso à l'élection présidentielle de 2009, obtient 364 sièges de conseillers sur 864.\n\nEn , fort du soutien de Ganao, Kolélas, Yhombi-Opango, etc., il se présente de nouveau à l'élection présidentielle. En dépit des réclamations de l'opposition, ce sont les listes électorales de 2002 qui sont de nouveau utilisées. Des 13 candidats en présence, il est le seul réellement actif durant la campagne. Le scrutin se tient le 12 juillet dans un climat de grande indifférence de la part des citoyens. Il est élu dès le premier tour avec 78 % de voix[45]. Le taux de participation officiel (66 %) laisse sceptiques de nombreux observateurs. Le , il forme un nouveau gouvernement.\n\nEn 2015, Denis Sassou-Nguesso organise une série de consultations avec des personnalités politiques du pays afin d’examiner une possible modification de la constitution en vigueur dans le pays depuis 2002[46] afin de briguer un troisième mandat. Des manifestations ont lieu ; la police tire à balles réelles sur les manifestants, parmi lesquels plusieurs sont tués[47].\n\nLe , la nouvelle constitution est adoptée par référendum[48]. Elle est entrée en vigueur le , après sa promulgation par Denis Sassou-Nguesso[49].\n\nLe , il est réélu dès le premier tour de l'élection présidentielle avec 60,07 % des voix[50], score validé par la Cour constitutionnelle le 4 avril. Ses adversaires Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas et le général Jean-Marie Mokoko avaient contesté les résultats partiels publiés la veille par la Commission électorale nationale indépendante (CENI), qui donnait Nguesso en tête avec 67 % des voix[51]. « Je savais d'avance que les dés étaient pipés, mais nous avions accepté de jouer le jeu », a déclaré le général Mokoko, qui était jusqu'en février conseiller du président Sassou-Nguesso pour les affaires de paix et de sécurité. Kolélas, a quant à lui estimé, par la voix de son porte-parole que la réélection de Denis Sassou Nguesso relevait d'une « fraude massive » et de la « magie »[52].\n\nSelon le candidat de l’opposition congolaise, le général Jean-Marie Michel Mokoko, les téléphones ont été coupés pendant quatre jours après la publication des premiers résultats de la CENI, et les résultats officiels ont été proclamés à 2 h du matin[53].\n\nSes deux opposants sont arrêtés en 2016, après leur refus de reconnaitre sa victoire, et condamnés en 2018 à 20 ans de prison pour « atteinte à la sécurité intérieure de l’État »[38],[54].\n\nLe 23 janvier 2021, Denis Sassou-Nguesso annonce qu'il sera candidat à sa propre succession lors de la présidentielle prévue le 21 mars 2021[55], à un quatrième mandat[56], toujours sous la même formation politique : le Parti congolais du travail (PCT)[57].\n\nL'ONG de lutte contre la corruption Global Witness révèle qu’une entreprise liée à la famille présidentielle congolaise tirerait près de 6 millions d’euros annuels grâce à une nouvelle prime imposée aux tankers pétroliers[58]. Elle précise que « ces révélations font surface à quelques mois de l'élection présidentielle de 2021 à laquelle Denis Sassou-Nguesso, président en exercice pendant 36 des 41 dernières années, se représentera. »\n\nLe 23 mars, la commission électorale annonce qu'il est réélu avec 88,57 % (résultats provisoires officiels)[59]. La participation est estimée à 67,55 % et son principal opposant, Guy Brice Parfait Kolélas, (mort de la Covid-19 le lendemain de l'élection), recueille 7,84 % des voix[60]. Ses opposants annoncent former des recours[61]. Le 6 avril 2021, La Cour constitutionnelle de la république du Congo a entériné la réélection du président Denis Sassou Nguesso au scrutin du 21 mars, après avoir rejeté les recours de l'opposition[62]. Il prête serment le 16 avril.\n\nEn octobre 2021, son nom est cité dans les Pandora Papers[63]. Son gouvernement dément toute implication dans cette affaire et annonce porter plainte contre les journalistes à l'origine de cette révélation[64].\n\nEn avril 2007, deux associations, Sherpa et Survie, ainsi que la Fédération des Congolais de la diaspora portent plainte en France contre cinq chefs d'États africains et leur famille, dont Denis Sassou-Nguesso, pour recel de détournements de fonds publics. Après une enquête préliminaire menée par l'Office Central pour la Répression de la Grande Délinquance Financière (OCRGDF), qui révèle un patrimoine immobilier et mobilier conséquent en France et de nombreux comptes bancaires, l'affaire, dite des biens mal acquis, est classée sans suite par le Procureur qui estime les charges insuffisantes[65].\n\nLe , une enquête s’ouvre sur Édith Bongo, fille de Denis Sassou-Nguesso et épouse d'Omar Bongo, décédée le 14 mars 2009, soupçonnée d'avoir servi de prête-nom à Omar Bongo et Denis Sassou-Nguesso auprès de plusieurs établissements bancaires, afin de dissimuler des capitaux provenant de détournements de fonds publics à Monaco. L'enquête fait suite au courrier de l'association Sherpa au prince Albert II et au procureur de Monaco demandant l'ouverture d'une information judiciaire et le gel des avoirs financiers à Monaco d'Édith Bongo. Le , une juge du pôle financier de Paris, Françoise Desset, juge recevable la plainte déposée en décembre 2008 pour « recel et détournement de fonds publics » par Transparency International France et l'Association Sherpa visant Denis Sassou-Nguesso et deux autres chefs d'État africains - Omar Bongo (Gabon) et Teodoro Obiang (Guinée équatoriale) - soupçonnés de posséder en France des biens mal acquis financés par de l'argent public détourné. Cette décision est prise contre l'avis du parquet qui dispose de cinq jours pour faire appel[66]. Le 8 mai 2009, le parquet a fait appel de cette décision et le 29 octobre 2009, la cour d'appel de Paris juge irrecevable cette plainte. Le 9 novembre 2010 la Cour de cassation annule la décision de la cour d'appel et rend possibles les poursuites.\n\nAvec son fils Denis Christel Sassou Nguesso, il fait partie d'un clan, dit « Nguesso », accusé d'avoir détourné 70 millions de dollars des caisses du Congo-Brazzaville[67].\n\nDenis Sassou-Nguesso est selon ses partisans, la cible en France d’une tentative de déstabilisation, par le biais d’une guérilla judiciaire[68][citation nécessaire].\n\nEn octobre 2023, l'avion Falcon de Denis Sassou-Nguesso est vendu aux enchères pour 7,1 millions d'euros - soit le tiers de sa valeur [69]- lors d'une vente ordonnée par le tribunal judiciaire de Bordeaux qui a eu lieu au Grand Hôtel de Bordeaux[70]. Cette vente doit permettre d’indemniser Commisimpex pour des travaux publics non payés[71].\n\nSous sa présidence, le pays est endetté, mais renoue avec une croissance solide, constamment supérieure à 2 % depuis 2004. Le PIB, de 5 milliards[précision nécessaire] en 1997, augmente pour atteindre 35 milliards[précision nécessaire] en 2017. Brazzaville avoue que la dette congolaise en 2019 était officiellement de 120 % du PIB congolais, et non de 77 % comme indiqué au FMI[72], et ce, alors qu’en 2010, les créanciers internationaux avaient annulé la grande majorité de cette dette (notamment le club de Paris)[44]. Il ne parvient jamais à rembourser celle-ci[73]. Il aura profité des renégociations pétrolières faites par l'ancien président Pascal Lissouba[74], qu’il a renversé par un coup d'État, après une guerre civile sanglante, qui ont permis de faire rentrer beaucoup d’argent dans les caisses nationales. La population vit pour 70 % avec moins de 1 dollar par jour, et ce malgré les ressources portuaires, minières et pétrolières, qui furent en constante augmentation jusqu'à nos jours[75].\n• Grand-croix de l'ordre international des Palmes académiques du CAMES (2013) 78\n• Le manguier, le fleuve et la souris, éditions Jean-Claude Lattès, 1997 (ISBN ).\n• L'Afrique, enjeu de la planète : Les nouveaux défis du développement durable, Jacques Marie éditeur, 2009 (ISBN ).\n• R.

Sus padres son Julien Nguesso and Émilienne Mouebara.[1]​ Fue el hermano más joven de la familia.[2]​ Se alistó en el Ejército en 1960, justo antes de la independencia del país. Recibió entrenamiento militar en Argelia y Saint Maixent, en Francia, antes de regresar a su país para unirse al regimiento de paracaidistas de élite.\n\nTenía tendencias socialistas y apoyó a la oposición a Fulbert Youlou en Les Trois Glorieuses de agosto de 1963. A pesar de esto, tomó parte en el golpe de Estado que llevó a Marien Ngouabi al poder, y fue uno de los primeros miembros del Partido Congoleño del Trabajo (PCT) cuando se fundó en diciembre de 1969. En 1970 Sassou Nguesso fue nombrado Director de Seguridad y ministro del nuevo consejo presidencial. Cuando Ngouabi fue asesinado Nguesso desempeñó un papel importante en el mantenimiento del control, liderando brevemente el Comité Militar del PCT que controló el Estado hasta la sucesión por parte del coronel Joachim Yhombi-Opango. Sassou Nguesso fue recompensado con una promoción a coronel y el puesto de videpresidente del CMP.\n\nPermaneció en el cargo de vicepresidente hasta el 5 de febrero de 1979, cuando Yhomby-Opango fue expulsado del poder en un golpe de Estado en el que se le acusó de corrupción y perversión política. El 8 de febrero el CMP eligió a Nguesso como nuevo presidente y en el Tercer Congreso Extraordinario del PCT su cargo fue confirmado.\n\nSassou Nguesso sorprendió a muchos observadores internacionales que veían en él únicamente a un hombre fuerte desde el punto de vista militar al revelar unas fuertes convicciones marxistas, así como habilidades para la política práctica. Negoció préstamos al FMI y permitió a los inversores de Francia y Estados Unidos acceder a las extracciones de petróleo y minerales. También viajó a Moscú en 1981 para firmar un pacto de amistad de veinte años con la Unión Soviética.\n\nFue reelegido presidente por otros cinco años en el Congreso del PCT celebrado en 1984, en los que moderó las políticas socialistas si la situación así lo requería. Fue presidente de la OUA entre 1986 y 1987. A finales de 1987 se enfrentó a una revuelta militar en el norte del país con la ayuda de Francia.\n\nTras el Congreso de 1989, Sassou Nguesso vio como se colapsaba el bloque comunista en Europa del Este y, bajo la presión francesa, empezó a preparar el proceso de transición al capitalismo. En diciembre de 1989 anunció el fin del control gubernamental de la economía y declaró una amnistía parcial para los presos políticos. Al año siguiente trató de mejorar la situación económica y reducir los niveles de corrupción de su gobierno. Desde agosto de 1990 se permitió la formación de otros partidos políticos y Sassou Nguesso realizó una visita oficial simbólica a los Estados Unidos que pondría los cimientos de una nueva serie de préstamos del Fondo Monetario Internacional a finales de aquel año. En febrero de 1991 se decidió establecer un gobierno democrático y Nguesso se apartó de la primera línea política, dejando que Andre Milongo fuera nombrado presidente provisional del CSR hasta las elecciones de 1992.\n\nEn las elecciones de junio y julio de 1992 el PCT consiguió solamente 19 de los 125 escaños de la Asamblea Nacional, la UPADS (Union panafricaine pour la démocratie sociale) de Pascal Lissouba fue el partido más votado y el MCDDI (Mouvement Congolais pour la démocratie et le développement intégral) de Bernard Kolelas la segunda fuerza política. En las elecciones presidenciales de agosto, el combate político se libró entre Lissouba (UPADS) y Kolelas (MCDDI). Lissouba ganó la segunda ronda con el 61% de los votos. Nguesso fue eliminado en la primera ronda tras obtener un 17% de los votos.\n\nLissouba empezó su gobierno entre acusaciones de manipulaciones de los votos, lo que provocó que incrementara la represión para poder mantener el poder. Desde noviembre de 1993 hasta final de año, los choques entre los partidarios de Kolelas y Lissouba arrojaron una cifra de 1.500 muertos. En 1994 Sassou Nguesso abandonó el país con destino a París, de donde no volvería hasta 1997 para participar en las elecciones electorales programadas para julio.\n\nEl 5 de junio de 1997 Lissouba ordenó a su ejército que rodease la residencia de Sassou Nguesso en Brazzaville. La milicia de Nguesso rechazó al ejército y estalló un conflicto mayor. Ngueso consiguió el apoyo de Angola y del 11 al 14 de octubre sus tropas tomaron Brazaville. Lissouba huyó y Nguesso fue nombrado presidente el 25 de octubre.\n\nSassou Nguesso se preparó para permitir una vuelta a la democracia y empezar un proceso de transición de tres años en 1998, pero el recrudecimiento de las luchas con la oposición llevaron al fracaso del proyecto. Con el incremento del poder de las fuerzas gubernamentales y los subsiguientes acuerdos de paz de 1999 las elecciones se reprogramaron para 2002, aunque no todos los grupos rebeldes firmaron los acuerdos. El 10 de marzo Sassou Nguesso ganó con casi el 90% de los votos, pues se impidió participar a sus dos rivales principales, Lissouba y Kolelas, y el único rival de cierta talla, Andre Milongo, pidió a sus partidarios que boicotearan las elecciones y por lo tanto se retiró de las mismas. Se acordó una nueva constitución en junio de 2002 que garantizaba al presidente nuevos poderes y además extendía su mandato a siete años además de instituir una nueva asamblea bicameral. Habiendo ejercido como presidente de la Organización para la Unidad Africana, fue elegido presidente de la Unión Africana, la organización sucesora de la OUA en enero de 2006.\n\nEn el 2009 gana las elecciones presidenciales.[3]​\n\nEl 23 de marzo, la comisión electoral anunció que Denis había nuevamente ganado con más del 88% de los votos.[4]​\n\nEn octubre de 2021, Denis Sassou-Nguesso fue citado en el escándalo de los Papeles de Pandora. Según el consorcio internacional de periodistas, fue en 1998, justo después del regreso al poder de Denis Sassou-Nguesso, cuando la empresa Se informó que la inversión interafricana se registró en las Islas Vírgenes Británicas, un paraíso fiscal del Caribe. Denis Sassou-Nguesso niega en bloque que se trate de documentos.Denis Sassou-Nguesso (1943- ) •: The long-serving president of the Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), Denis Sassou-Nguesso was born on November 23, 1943, in Edou. His parents were Julien Nguesso, a noted hunter-chief, and Emilienne Mouebara. Denis Sassou-Nguesso attended elementary school in Owando and was also initiated in the Mbochi tribal cult. Between 1956 and 1960 he attended the Dolisie Normal College in Loubomo, Republic of the Congo.\n\nSassou-Nguesso joined the army in 1960. In 1962 he was sent to Algeria for reserve officer training. Later he attended the Infantry School in France. He then returned to Congo to join and lead an elite paratroop regiment. In 1963 Sassou-Nguesso was appointed commander of military forces in Brazzaville.\n\nSassou-Nguesso helped form the Congolese Labor party with Marien Ngouabi in 1969. The party was Marxist-Leninist. That same year he was part of a military coup that ousted President Massemaba Debat and installed Ngouabi as president. On May 18, 1973, Sassou-Nguesso, was made Director of the State’s Security and Minister of Defense. He was 32 years old at the time.\n\nOn March 18, 1977 Ngouabi was assassinated. The army took control of the government and, after some internal squabbles, Sassou-Nguesso was appointed president on February 8, 1979. On July 8, 1979 elections were held and Sassou-Nguesso was elected president. He was re-elected in 1984 and 1989.\n\nWith pressure from Western countries, opposition parties were legalized in1990. In the 1992 presidential election, Sassou-Nguesso was eliminated in the first round. Pascal Lassouba was elected president. After parliamentary elections in 1993 fighting broke out between militias loyal to Lassouba and Sassou-Nguesso. This civil war lasted until December 1995. Over 2,000 Congolese were killed and 100,000 displaced during the conflict.\n\nCivil war broke out again in 1997 between Lassouba and Sassou-Nguesso supporters. With the help of Angolan troops, Sassou-Nguesso was victorious. He was sworn in as president on October 25, 1997. However, fighting continued until 1999. Thousands died and over 800.000 were displaced.\n\nA presidential election was held in 1992 and Sassou-Nguesso was re-elected and again in 2009. In 2015 the constitution was changed to allow him to run for a third term. In the March 2016 election, he was re-elected but many observers believed the election process was unfair. In 2021 Sassou-Nguesso he was elected for another five-year term.\n\nSassou-Nguesso has been accused of embezzlement, misuse of public funds, and money laundering. In May 2009, a French Court announced an investigation into whether Sassou-Nguesso had plundered state coffers to buy luxury homes and cars in France. Sassou-Nguesso’s son, Denis-Christel, a member of the national legislature and cabinet minister for international cooperation, has been charged with corruptly obtaining $50 million from the national treasury. His daughter, Claudia Lemboumba, a member of the national legislature and head of the presidential communications office, has been accused of using $20 million in government funds to purchase a flat in Trump Towers in New York City. Another daughter, Julienne, has been accused of money laundering.\n\nDenis Sassou-Nguesso is married to Antoinette Sassou-Nguesso. He has several children: Denis-Christel, Edith-Lucie, Wamba, Claudia Lemboumba, Kelly Christelle, Denis, jr., Andrea, Julienne, Cendrine, Ninelle, and Karine-Emma.Progressive supranuclear palsy 1979: an overview - Neurological Sciences: \n• None Cadwalader W.B., 1927: quoted byCollier J.

This will play a big part in the novel’s sensibility as the two protagonists are gay when it’s really not okay to admit this. That year also puts us on the precipice of a new decade, and with it the dreams of a future world where our lives would be better, if not easier. As you turn the last page, I bet you will be happy to return to our turbulent present.\n\nIn the prologue, a man braves a blizzard to proceed to his own destiny and a night of reckoning that will soon be at hand. Before the novel is over, you'll be able to piece together who he is, but it'll be too late to prevent what he's planning to do.\n\nThe setting is Scotland, and it is indeed a different time period from our own. In fact, when journalist Allie Burns decided to go to school at Cambridge, she may as well have been parachuting into Mars. The perspective that she gains from that experience will certainly help her when she returns to Scotland. Allie and her best friend/colleague, Danny Sullivan, write for the local paper The Clarion. Early on in the book, they help a woman give birth in public. It is not simply good PR for their paper, but an event they can truly bond over. Allie sees herself as a feminist, not a man-hater, and enjoys hanging out with Danny. Perhaps the fact that they are both closeted about their sexuality gives them more reason to stick by each other.\n\nAllie will soon be “mentored” by another female writer, Rona Dunsyre, who also leads an alternate lifestyle and is able to show Allie how to do so inconspicuously so as to not make her already difficult career aspirations any harder. Allie gets hazed in a good-natured way at the paper but is determined to become a serious investigative journalist. She sees an opportunity when a tip that she and Danny follow leads to an iceberg in the form of some wealthy Scottish businesspeople who are possibly involved in a tax fraud scheme.\n\nAs Allie begins to tread in dangerous waters, she faces her first real threat as she questions Brian McGillivray, a Scottish businessman. Danny has his own period of awakening; at one point he turns to Allie and asks, “What have I done?” She takes this opportunity to answer with the best piece of advice she has to put his mind at ease: “The right thing.”\n\nAllie and Danny find their investigative journalism snowballing, and it takes them to a very taboo area. 1979 was not a time to have a high-profile professional career and be openly gay. When their paths cross with Torrance, a closeted investigator who is a member of the Special Branch, they find themselves unwittingly in the face of true peril. Their work takes them from dirty businesspeople to closeted members of law enforcement and even those who rubbed shoulders with homegrown terrorists. The fact that Danny kept a notebook that had a list of individuals who led secret, alternative lifestyles puts him in more danger than he ever imagined.\n\nWhen Allie comes to Danny’s place to find his head in the middle of a spreading pool of blood, she realizes that the feather they had ruffled has now led to one of them being permanently silenced. The crossroads that Allie stands at is one that not only will color the rest of her career, but may put her life in danger. She carefully seeks to avenge Danny’s murder and see that justice is served via the pages of The Clarion.\n\n1979 is classic Val McDermid and great fun from start to finish. In the Acknowledgements, she reflects on being a journalist in 1979, much like Allie Burns, and that working on this novel was a potent reminder of how much you can forget. I especially loved the musical references and her inclusion of “My 1979 Top 40.” It’s an impressive list, and I could have seen myself swapping mix tapes with her. There are musical references throughout the story, including one about my favorite Bruce Springsteen album, Darkness on the Edge of Town. Now, if I could just pick McDermid’s brain and find out why she omitted “My Sharona.”"}

She returned to television in the limited series The Widow (2019).\n\nKathrin Romany Beckinsale was born on 26 July 1973 in the Chiswick district of London,[4][5] the only child of actors Richard Beckinsale and Judy Loe.[6] She has a half-sister from her father's earlier marriage, actress Samantha Beckinsale.[6] Her father was partly of Burmese descent.[7][8] Her parents did not marry until 1977, prior to Beckinsale starting nursery school,[9] when she made her first television appearance at age four, in an episode of This Is Your Life, dedicated to her father.[10] When she was five, her father died suddenly of a heart attack, aged 31. She was deeply traumatised by the loss and \"started expecting bad things to happen.\"[11][6]\n\nHer widowed mother moved in with director Roy Battersby when Beckinsale was nine and she was brought up alongside his four sons and daughter.[12] She had a close relationship with her stepfather,[6] who was a member of the Workers Revolutionary Party during her youth.[13] She helped to sell The News Line, a Trotskyist newspaper, as a little girl and has said the household phone was tapped following Battersby's blacklisting by the BBC.[13] Family friends included Ken Loach and Vanessa Redgrave.[13]\n\nBeckinsale was educated at Godolphin and Latymer School, an independent school for girls in Hammersmith, West London, and was involved with the Orange Tree Youth Theatre.[14] She was twice a winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry.[15] She has described herself as a \"late bloomer\": \"All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way before me. I found it really depressing that we weren't making camp fires and everyone was doing stuff like that.\"[16] She had a nervous breakdown and developed anorexia aged 15,[17] and underwent Freudian psychoanalysis for four years.[6]\n\nBeckinsale studied Russian at school[18] and read French and Russian literature at New College, Oxford, and was later described by her contemporary Victoria Coren Mitchell, as \"whip-clever, slightly nuts, and very charming\".[19] She became friends with Roy Kinnear's daughter Kirsty.[20] She was involved with the Oxford University Dramatic Society, most notably being directed by fellow student Tom Hooper in a production of A View from the Bridge at the Oxford Playhouse.[21] As a Modern Languages student, she was required to spend her third year abroad, and studied in Paris. She then quit university to focus on her burgeoning acting career: \"It was getting to the point where I wasn't enjoying either thing enough because both were very high pressure.\"[6] Beckinsale has stated she would like to complete her studies at Oxford University.[22][23]\n\nBeckinsale decided at a young age she wanted to be an actress: \"I grew up immersed in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends' parents.\"[24] She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau.[25] She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P. D. James' Devices and Desires.[26] In 1992, she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in \"Rachel's Dream,\" a 30‑minute Channel 4 short.[27] In 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs.[28]\n\nIn 1993, Beckinsale landed the role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University. She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and remembered it as an overwhelming experience. \"Nobody even told me I could bring a friend!\"[16] \"I had Doc Martens boots on, and I think I put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair.\"[29] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her \"lovely\" performance.[30] Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard \"look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak.\"[31] The film grossed over $22 million at the box office.[32]\n\nShe made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet,[33] and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered.[34] In 1995, while studying in Paris, she filmed the French language Marie-Louise ou la permission.[35]\n\nShortly after leaving Oxford University in 1995, Beckinsale starred in Cold Comfort Farm, as Flora Poste, a newly orphaned 1930s socialite sent to live with distant family members in rural England. The John Schlesinger-directed film was an adaptation of Stella Gibbons's novel and also featured Joanna Lumley, Eileen Atkins, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell and Stephen Fry. Beckinsale was initially considered too young, but was cast after she wrote a pleading letter to the director.[36] Emanuel Levy of Variety was reminded of \"the strength of a young Glenda Jackson and the charm of a young Julie Christie.\"[37] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times classed the actress as \"yet another of those effortlessly skilled British beauties who light up the screen.\"[38] Janet Maslin of The New York Times felt she played the role \"with the perfect snippy aplomb.\"[39] The film grossed over $5 million at the US box office.[40]\n\nAlso in 1995, she appeared in Haunted, a ghost story in which Derek Elley of Variety felt she \"holds the screen, with both physical looks and verbal poise.\"[41] 1995 saw Beckinsale's first professional stage appearance, as Nina in The Seagull at Theatre Royal, Bath. She became romantically involved with co-star Michael Sheen after meeting during play rehearsals.[42] She later said: \"I was all revved up to feel very intimidated. It was my first-ever play and my mother had cut out reviews of him in previous productions. And then he walked in ... It was almost like, 'God, well, I'm finished now. That's it, then.'... He's the most outrageously talented person I've ever met.\"[43] Irving Wardle of The Independent felt that \"the casting, including Michael Sheen's volcanic Kostya and Kate Beckinsale's steadily freezing Nina, is mainly spot-on.\"[44] In early 1996, she starred in two further plays, Sweetheart at the Royal Court Theatre[45] and Clocks and Whistles at the Bush Theatre.[46]\n\nBeckinsale next starred in an ITV adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, playing Emma to Mark Strong's Mr Knightley and Samantha Morton's Harriet Smith. \"You shouldn't necessarily like Emma,\" Beckinsale has said of her character. \"You do love her, but in the way the family of a young girl could be exasperated by her outrageous behaviour and still love her.\"[36] The programme was aired in autumn 1996, just months after Gwyneth Paltrow had starred in a film adaptation of the same story.[36] Caryn James of The New York Times felt that while \"Ms. Beckinsale's Emma is plainer looking than Ms. Paltrow's,\" she is \"altogether more believable and funnier.\"[47] Jonathan Brown of The Independent has described Beckinsale's interpretation as \"the most enduring modern performance\" as Emma.[48]\n\nIn 1997, Beckinsale appeared opposite Stuart Townsend in the comedy Shooting Fish, one of the most commercially successful British films of that year.[49][50] \"I'd just had my wisdom teeth out,\" Beckinsale later recalled of the initial audition. \"I was also on very strong painkillers, so it was not the most conventional of meetings.\"[51] Elley wrote of \"an incredibly laid-back performance\".[52] Thomas felt she \"just glows as an aristocrat facing disaster with considerable aplomb.\"[53] She narrated Austen's Emma for Hodder & Stoughton AudioBooks[54] and Diana Hendry's \"The Proposal\" for BBC Radio 4.[55][56] Also in 1997, she played Juliet to Michael Sheen's Romeo, in an audio production of Romeo and Juliet, directed by Sheen.[57]\n\nIn Beckinsale's last film before her move to the US, she starred as Alice in Channel 4's Alice Through the Looking-Glass, released in July 1998.[58]\n\nAt this point in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, something she has said wasn't \"a conscious decision... My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films.\"[59] She starred opposite Chloë Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused on a group of mostly Ivy League and Hampshire College graduates socialising in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale's American accent was widely praised.[60][61][62] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was \"beautifully played.\"[63] Todd McCarthy of Variety was unimpressed by the film but noted that \"compensations include Beckinsale, looking incredible in a succession of black dresses, whose character can get on your nerves even if the actress doesn't.\"[64] Her performance earned her a London Critics' Circle Film Award.[65] The film grossed $3 million worldwide.[66]\n\nIn 1999, Beckinsale appeared opposite Claire Danes in Brokedown Palace, a drama about two young Americans forced to deal with the Thai justice system on a post-graduation trip abroad. A then 26-year-old Beckinsale played a young girl.[67] Danes had hoped to become friends with Beckinsale during the shoot but found her \"complicated\" and \"prickly.\"[68] McCarthy said the leads \"confirm their status as two of the young actresses on the scene today most worth watching,\" finding Beckinsale \"very effective at getting across layered character traits and emotions.\"[69] \"Danes and Beckinsale are exceptionally talented young actresses,\" said Thomas, but \"unfortunately, the script's seriously underdeveloped context defeats their considerable efforts at every turn.\"[70] Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that Beckinsale's character \"never comes into focus.\"[71] The film was a box office failure.[72]\n\n2000's The Golden Bowl marked Beckinsale's first role following the birth of her daughter. The Merchant/Ivory production was based on the novel by Henry James and also starred Uma Thurman and Jeremy Northam. Beckinsale's partner, Michael Sheen, hit Northam on the film set after he followed Beckinsale to her trailer to scold her for forgetting a line.[73] Holden noted \"the most satisfying of the four-lead performances belong to the British cast members, Ms. Beckinsale and Mr. Northam, who are better than their American counterparts at layers of emotional concealment,\" adding each beat of Beckinsale's performance \"registers precisely.\"[74] Thomas felt her performance would take her to \"a new career level.\"[75] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer asserted that she \"comes close to capturing the sublimity of Maggie, despite the obvious fact that no movie can capture the elegant copiousness of James' prose.\"[76] The film grossed over $5 million worldwide.[77]\n\nBeckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with a leading role in the war film Pearl Harbor, as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: \"It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, sweeping epic....You just never get the chance to do that.\"[78] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: \"I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut.\"[79] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't \"too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone's too pretty.\"[80] He asked her to lose weight during filming.[81]\n\nIn a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were \"upsetting\"[82] and said she wore leather trousers because \"it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in.\"[83] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: \"If I had come on to a movie set at [a younger] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?' – I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time.\"[79] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was \"very fond\" of Bay.[84]\n\nPearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised \"the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony.\"[85] A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that \"Mr. Affleck and Ms. Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars.\"[86] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the \"usually appealing Kate Beckinsale\" is \"inexplicably submerged – like her hospital colleagues – under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear.\"[87] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.[88]\n\nBeckinsale's second film appearance of 2001 was in the romantic comedy Serendipity, as the love interest of John Cusack. It was filmed directly after Pearl Harbor and Beckinsale found it \"a real relief to return to something slightly more familiar.\"[59] Turan praised the \"appealing and believable\" leads, adding that Beckinsale \"reinforces the strong impression she made in Cold Comfort Farm, The Golden Bowl, and The Last Days of Disco\" after \"recovering nicely\" from her appearance in the much-maligned Pearl Harbor.[89] Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that \"Beckinsale's talents haven't been mined as effectively in any other film since Cold Comfort Farm.\"[90] McCarthy found her \"energetic and appealing\".[91] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times described her as \"luminous but determined.\"[92] In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Roger Ebert described her as \"a good actress, but not good enough to play this dumb.\"[93] The film grossed over $77 million at the worldwide box office.[94]\n\nIn 2002, Beckinsale starred in Lisa Cholodenko's Laurel Canyon, as a strait-laced academic who finds herself increasingly attracted to her free-spirited future mother-in-law. The independent film was another opportunity for Beckinsale to work with Christian Bale, her Prince of Jutland co‑star. She found their sex scene awkward because she knew Bale well: \"If it was a stranger, it would have been easier.\"[95] While Frances McDormand's performance as Bale's mother was widely praised, Beckinsale received negative reviews. Holden found the film \"superbly acted, with the exception of Ms. Beckinsale, whose tense, colourless Alex conveys no inner life.\"[96] Critic Lisa Schwarzbaum was unimpressed by the \"tedious\" characters and criticised \"the fussy performances of Bale and Beckinsale\" in particular.[97] The film grossed over $4 million worldwide.[98]\n\nBeckinsale became known as an action star after playing a vampire in 2003's Underworld. The film was markedly different from her previous work, and Beckinsale has said she was grateful for the change of pace after appearing in \"a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies,\"[99] adding that \"It was quite a challenge for me to play an action heroine and pull off all that training when [in real life] I can't catch a ball if it's coming my way.\"[100] The film received negative to mixed reviews but was a surprise box-office hit and has gained a cult following.[101] Also in 2003, she starred in the little seen Tiptoes with Gary Oldman and Matthew McConaughey.[102]\n\nIn 2004, Beckinsale starred in the action horror film Van Helsing. She was \"so surprised\" to be appearing in her second action film in two years. \"It just seemed like a very good role.\"[103] Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen at the time of filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: \"I really did find that working with people like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get through what I was going through.\"[104] The film grossed over $120 million at the US box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed.[105][106] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as \"a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy\".[107] Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was \"desperately in need of a new agent.\"[108]\n\nAlso in 2004, Beckinsale portrayed Ava Gardner in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator. Scorsese decided to cast Beckinsale because, \"I've always liked her. I've seen all her work, and I was glad that she agreed to audition.\"[109] Beckinsale's performance received mixed reviews. Ken Tucker of New York Magazine said she played the part \"in full va-va-voom blossom\".[110] LaSalle felt that she manages \"to convince us that Ava was one of the great broads of all time.\"[111] However, Clark described it as \"the one performance that doesn't come off (though Beckinsale has the requisite beauty)\".[112] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that \"Gardner's rich, voluptuous sexiness is completely absent as Beckinsale sleepwalks through the role as if she was advertising perfume.\"[113] The film grossed over $213 million worldwide.[114]\n\nIn 2006, Beckinsale reprised her role as Selene in the successful vampire sequel Underworld: Evolution, directed by her husband, Len Wiseman.[115] It was the first time she had \"been involved with a movie from the moment it's a germ of an idea right through the whole editing process.\"[116] Her daughter had a small role as the younger Selene.[116] The film was a box office success, grossing $111 million worldwide.[117] Beckinsale's second film appearance of 2006 was opposite Adam Sandler and Christopher Walken in Click, a comedy about an overworked family man who discovers a magical remote control that allows him to control time. The opportunity to play a mother \"was one of the things that was attractive to me\" about the part.[118] It was highly profitable, grossing $237 million worldwide against a production budget of $82.5 million.[119]\n\nBeckinsale then made a return to smaller-scale projects: \"My experience is that I sort of stepped away from the independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand.\"[120] \"I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person [but] it's not something that I would like to do solely.\"[121] She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles – it was \"assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers\"[122] – but that her action career \"kind of took off a little too much.\"[123]\n\nIn 2007, Beckinsale starred opposite Sam Rockwell in the independent drama Snow Angels, based on the novel by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale \"in kind of a tough place.\" \"I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love.\"[121] Puig felt \"Beckinsale gives her best performance in years\".[124] Richard Corliss of Time described it as \"her sharpest work yet.\"[125] However, Scott felt that \"her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it's a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn.\"[126] The film grossed solely $414,404 worldwide.[127]\n\nAlso in 2007, Beckinsale appeared alongside Luke Wilson in Vacancy, a thriller set in an isolated motel. Sarah Jessica Parker was originally cast in the part, but she dropped out before filming began.[128] Bradshaw felt \"Wilson and Beckinsale have the chops for scary movies\".[129] Gleiberman noted \"Luke Wilson, with his hangdog defensive mopiness, and Kate Beckinsale, all sexy severity, are ideally matched as a couple who hate each other.\"[130] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was unimpressed, referring to Beckinsale as \"the reigning queen of the bland B's.\"[131] The film was profitable, grossing $35 million worldwide against a production budget of $19 million.[132]\n\nIn 2008, Beckinsale appeared in Winged Creatures, a film about how six different witnesses cope with the aftermath of a shooting. Beckinsale played a waitressing single mother in an ensemble cast which included Dakota Fanning, Jennifer Hudson, and Forest Whitaker. \"It was a really, really nice experience but it was quick,\" said Beckinsale of the filming process. \"I just felt a bit like I was shot through a cannon.\"[121] Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she played the role \"with a white trash verve\" and found her character's \"raw ache for that someone with money and respectability is palpable.\"[133] However, Dargis felt that Beckinsale and her cast mates have a \"tough time filling out characters that are at best abstractions of grief and often just clichés.\"[134] The film received a very limited theatrical release in New York and Los Angeles; it was released simultaneously on DVD.[135]\n\nAlso in 2008, Beckinsale starred in Nothing but the Truth, as a journalist who refuses to reveal her source. The film, co‑starring Vera Farmiga and Matt Dillon, was inspired by the case of Judith Miller. As part of her research for the role, \"I spent some time at The L.A. Times with some female reporters, and I spoke to Judith Miller about her experience....I really researched the hell out of that one and it was an amazingly fulfilling, brilliant experience.\"[121] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asserted that Beckinsale and Farmiga played \"two of the most fascinating female movie characters to hit screens in a long while, and they've been brought to life by two gifted actresses, each working at the top of her game.\"[136] Beckinsale received a Critic's Choice Award nomination for her performance.[137] The film never received a full theatrical release after the distributor filed for bankruptcy[138] and the film grossed solely $186,702 worldwide.[139] \"I have prayed – prayed – for film companies to go bankrupt on films I've made, and then this happens on the one I love,\" said Beckinsale. \"Usually it's the ones you're most embarrassed about that are on the side of every bus.\"[140]\n\nIn 2009, Beckinsale starred in the comic-book adaption Whiteout, as a US Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada.[123] She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because \"three pairs of trousers and a parka gives you a bit more protection than the latex suit.\"[123] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget.[141] With critics consensus: Beckinsale is as lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold.[141] She also made a brief cameo in the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans; she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld.[142]\n\nAlso in 2009, Beckinsale starred in the family drama Everybody's Fine alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her Snow Angels co-star. Beckinsale was excited by the opportunity to work with De Niro, whom she had first encountered \"years and years ago when I just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of The Good Shepherd.\".[120] Everybody's Fine was a box office flop, failing to recoup its production budget.[143] In May 2010, Beckinsale sat on the nine-member 2010 Cannes Film Festival jury, chaired by director Tim Burton.[144] Unable to find a script she felt passionate about, Beckinsale kept a low profile in 2010 and 2011, opting to spend time with her daughter.[145]\n\nBeckinsale returned to acting in 2012 with appearances in three action films. Beckinsale first appeared in the action thriller Contraband. She had a supporting role as the wife of Mark Wahlberg's character, a former criminal who gets forced back into a life of crime after his family members are threatened. The film was directed by Baltasar Kormákur, who also starred in the Icelandic language version of the film, Reykjavík-Rotterdam.[146] The San Francisco Chronicle felt Beckinsale was \"stuck in a bit of a thankless role as the victimised wife, but she does try to infuse a harder edge to the character.\"[147] The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"Beckinsale, her innate classiness calibrated down a few notches, has little to do but be supportive, worried and, eventually, besieged.\"[148] Entertainment Weekly felt that the \"woman-in-peril stuff is second-rate, giving off a whiff of exploitation\"[149] while Variety found the repeated violence towards Beckinsale's character disturbing.[150] The film had a production budget of $25 million and grossed over $96 million worldwide.[151]\n\nBeckinsale next reprised her role as Selene in the fourth instalment of the vampire franchise Underworld: Awakening.[142] The franchise was initially conceived of as a trilogy and Beckinsale was not \"intending to do another one\" but was convinced by the quality of the script.[152] The Hollywood Reporter noted that \"when she's not actually fighting, her performance consists of little more than striding purposefully toward or away from the camera.\"[153] The Los Angeles Times remarked that she \"finally manages to perfect the monotone delivery she'd been honing for the series' first two entries.\"[154] The film had a production budget of $70 million and grossed over $160 million worldwide.[155][156]\n\nAlso in 2012, Beckinsale appeared as the wife of a factory worker in the sci-fi action remake Total Recall, directed by her husband Len Wiseman.[157] She has said Wiseman joined the project because he was unable to receive studio financing for an original sci-fi idea: \"You're constantly finding yourself having to defend doing a remake when you didn't really want to make one in the first place.\"[145] The film received mainly negative reviews.[158] Variety found her performance \"one-note\" while The Hollywood Reporter described her as \"one-dimensional.\"[159][160] USA Today remarked that she \"spends much of the movie strutting down hallways and looking relentlessly, though blandly, nasty.\"[161] The film grossed $198 million against a production budget of over $125 million.[162][163] In 2012, she appeared alongside Judy Greer and Andrea Savage in the Funny or Die video \"Republicans, Get in My Vagina\", a satire of the Republican Party's policies concerning abortion and prenatal care.[164]\n\nIn 2013, Beckinsale starred in the legal thriller The Trials of Cate McCall opposite Nick Nolte and James Cromwell.[165] The film received negative reviews and was released as a Lifetime movie.[166][167] She next appeared in the little-seen psychological thriller Stonehearst Asylum, loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.\"[168][169] A lukewarm critical reception greeted the film upon its DVD release; Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said Beckinsale was \"emoting as if an Oscar nomination depended on it\"[170] while Dennis Harvey of Variety found her performance \"overwrought.\"[171] In 2014, she provided the voice for Queen Ayrenn, a character in The Elder Scrolls Online video game.[172]\n\nAlso in 2014, Beckinsale starred in the psychological thriller The Face of an Angel alongside Daniel Brühl. The film, directed by Michael Winterbottom, was inspired by the case of Meredith Kercher.[173] Jesse Hassenger of The A.V. Club felt her \"charismatic\" performance was wasted.[174] Also in 2015, she starred alongside Simon Pegg in the poorly received British comedy Absolutely Anything, as an author agency employee and the love interest of a man (Pegg) chosen by four aliens to do anything he wants.[175] Tom Huddleston of Time Out said her character \"is never really developed – which is perhaps a blessing, because her cut-glass-posh performance is almost as grating as Pegg's.\"[176] A fan of Monty Python growing up, in 2014 Beckinsale appeared on the fourth episode of Monty Python's Best Bits (Mostly) where she spoke of her favourite Python comedy sketch.[177]\n\nIn the 2016 romantic comedy Love & Friendship, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, Beckinsale reunited with her Last Days of Disco collaborators Stillman and Sevigny. Based on Jane Austen's Lady Susan, the film revolved around her role as the title character, a wry and calculating widow, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself. The film was universally acclaimed by critics[178] and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas.[179] Justin Chang of Variety described the role as \"one of the most satisfying screen roles of her career [...] Beckinsale magnetizes the screen in a way that naturally underscores how far ahead of everyone else she is: an effect that doesn't always work to the movie's advantage.\"[180] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, \"There aren't great depths to the role, but Beckinsale excels with the long speeches and in defining her character as a very self-aware egoist.\"[181]\n\nAlso in the year, she starred in the horror film The Disappointments Room, opposite Mel Raido, both playing a couple in a new house that contains a hidden room with a haunted past. The film was heavily panned by critics and flopped at the box office;[182] it only made $1.4 million in its opening weekend, and a total of $2.4 million in North America.[183] Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly concluded that \"[m]ost of the film is just Beckinsale walking around looking worried\",[184] while Joe Leydon of Variety found her \"credible and compelling [...] except for when she's trying way too hard in a rather unfortunate scene that calls for drunken ranting.\"[185] In late 2016, Beckinsale returned as Selene in the fifth instalment of the Underworld franchise, Underworld: Blood Wars, which grossed $81.1 million worldwide.[186][187]\n\nBeckinsale starred opposite Pierce Brosnan, Callum Turner, and Jeff Bridges in Marc Webb's romantic coming-of-age drama The Only Living Boy in New York (2017),[188] as a book editor and the mistress of a publisher whose son sees his life upended. Reviews of the film were mediocre, while it found a limited audience in theatres.[189] The A.V. Club found Brosnan and Beckinsale to be \"vastly more interesting by the twin virtues of not disguising their voices and fitting so poorly into the sad-faced melodrama this movie wants to be\".[190] She is attached to star in an adaptation of The Chocolate Money by Ashley Prentice Norton,[191] with a screenplay by Emma Forrest.[192] In 2018, Beckinsale starred as Ingrid Carpenter in the British film Farming.[193]\n\nBeckinsale starred in the ITV/Amazon Prime drama The Widow (2019), her first TV series for more than 20 years.[194] The series stars Beckinsale as an Englishwoman who believes her husband, killed in a plane crash three years prior, is still alive in the Congo.[195][196] Beckinsale starred in the American action comedy film Jolt alongside Bobby Cannavale, Laverne Cox, Stanley Tucci and Jai Courtney. Jolt was adapted from a screenplay by Scott Wascha and directed by Tanya Wexler and released by Amazon Studios on 23 July 2021.[197] That same year she starred in the Paramount+ dark comedy streaming television Guilty Party. In that series, she served as executive producer as well.[198]\n\nIn 2021, Deadline announced that Beckinsale will star in the Catherine Hardwicke directed family drama Prisoner's Daughter.[199]\n\nLabelled an \"English rose\" by the BBC as early as 2001,[200] Beckinsale has worked occasionally as a model. In 1997, she appeared in the music video for George Michael's \"Waltz Away Dreaming\".[65] She starred opposite Orlando Bloom in a 2002 Gap television advertisement directed by Cameron Crowe.[201] She appeared in a Diet Coke television advertisement in 2004, directed by Michel Gondry.[202][203] She advertised Absolut Vodka in a 2009 print campaign photographed by Ellen von Unwerth.[204][205]\n\nBeckinsale was in a relationship with Welsh actor Michael Sheen from 1995 to 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards.[206][207][208] In 1997, they voiced an audiobook production of Romeo and Juliet.[57] Their daughter Lily Mo Sheen was born in 1999.[209][210] In 2001, Beckinsale said she was \"embarrassed\" that Sheen never proposed,[43][211] but felt as though she was married.[212] They broke up in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld.[213] Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends. She remarked in 2016, \"He's really dear, close family. He's somebody I've known since I was 21 years old. I really love him a lot.\"[214]\n\nBeckinsale met American director Len Wiseman while working together on 2003's Underworld.[215] She persuaded Wiseman to cast Sheen in the film,[216] but while on set, Beckinsale and Wiseman fell in love. Wiseman's then-wife Dana, a kindergarten teacher, accused her husband of infidelity with Beckinsale.[217] Beckinsale and Wiseman married on 9 May 2004 in Bel-Air, California.[218] They separated in November 2015. Wiseman filed for divorce in 2016, citing \"irreconcilable differences\".[219][220] Their divorce was finalised in November 2019.[221] Beckinsale briefly dated American comedian Matt Rife in 2017 and 2018 while she was still married.[222][223]\n\nIn January 2019, Beckinsale was reported to be dating American comedian Pete Davidson. In April they \"called time on their romance.\"[224]\n\nBeckinsale is a smoker.[225] When she was nine, her mother moved in with Roy Battersby, and his sons introduced her to cigarettes.[17]\n\nShe is a teetotaller, stating in 2003, \"I've never been drunk even. I've never taken drugs. I've never had a one-night-stand.\"[226]\n\nIn 2007, she appeared alongside David Schwimmer in the sixth of the Writers Guild of America member-conceived Internet videos for Project \"Speechless,\" in support of the WGA labour strike against the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers.[227][228]\n\nIn 2012, she appeared alongside Judy Greer and Andrea Savage in the Funny or Die video \"Republicans, Get in My Vagina,\" a satire of the Republican Party's policies concerning abortion and prenatal care.[229]\n\nIn July 2003, the Press Complaints Commission dismissed a complaint filed by Beckinsale. She alleged that the tabloid Daily Mail had invaded her and her daughter's privacy by publishing photographs of the actress embracing and kissing her then-boyfriend Len Wiseman.[230] The article in question was headlined, \"Mummy's latest love scene leaves Lily unimpressed\" and included a picture in which her then-four-year-old daughter appeared to be ignoring her mother's romantic actions.[230] The Commission found that \"the photographs had been taken in a public place and did not reveal any private details about Lily—such as her health or schooling—but were restricted to general observations about her apparent reaction to her surroundings.\"[230]\n\nIn August 2003, Beckinsale received a published apology from the Daily Mail after it claimed that she had \"spent time in a clinic\" following her break-up with Michael Sheen.[231] The apology was issued after she filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission.[231] In 2009, Beckinsale was awarded £20,000 (equivalent to £33,900 in 2023) in damages by the British High Court after taking legal action against Express Newspapers.[232] The Daily Express had falsely reported that she was \"facing heartbreak\" after losing out on a role in a remake of Barbarella.[232]\n\nThe British Heart Foundation has been Beckinsale's charity of choice \"ever since [she] was six years old\"[233][234] when her father, who had coronary artery disease, died of a massive heart attack. She has also donated film memorabilia to the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation,[235][236] MediCinema,[237] Habitat For Humanity[238] and the Entertainment Industry Foundation.[239] In 2008, she hosted the 4th Annual Pink Party to raise funds for the Women's Cancer Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center[240] and organised a screening of All About Eve for FilmAid International.[241] In 2012, Beckinsale joined Nestlé's Share the Joy of Reading Program to raise awareness about the importance of people's literacy.[242]\n\nExcept for her two appearances on the 1975 British daytime marriage counseling drama Couples,[263] which was made before the BBC began to archive all of its productions and so may no longer exist, all of Beckinsale's recorded performances are publicly available on various media. The vast majority are available in high definition.[264]\n\nThe domestic theatrical cut of Shooting Fish contains a few minutes cut from the international release. Only the original UK VHS release includes these scenes on home media; the UK VHS rerelease and all DVD and streaming releases are of the shorter international cut.[265]\n\nThe early DVD releases of Underworld feature two audio commentaries; one artistic and the other technical. The latter was dropped from all subsequent DVD releases and never released on Blu-ray.[266][267]\n\nGuilty Party was originally available in 4K Dolby Vision on Paramount+ but is now available, after a period of official unavailability,[268] only in 1080p SDR through other services,[269] and has not been released on physical media.[270]\n\nHer narrations of Emma,[271] Emma & Knightley: Perfect Happiness in Highbury,[272] and Bold Little Tiger[273] were released only on cassette.\n\nThe dramatization of Romeo and Juliet in which she plays Juliet was released on cassette[274] and remains available on CD and digitally through Audible and the Naxos Spoken Word Library.[275]\n\nHer narration of Pride and Prejudice is available exclusively as a digital audiobook through Apple Books.[276]\n\nPIDAX released the complete series of Anna Lee (including \"Headcase\") on DVD in 2021,[277] but only with a German dub, without the original English audio.[278]\n\n\"Rachel's Dream,\"[279] Anna Lee with its original English audio,[280] Marie-Louise ou la permission,[281] and \"The Proposal\"[282] haven't been released on home media but can be found on YouTube or the Internet Archive.\n\nAll television advertisements and web shorts in which she has appeared in can be viewed on YouTube.[283]\n\nHer five-stage performances are not known to have been recorded, although a few photographs exist.[284]Kate Beckinsale - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Kathrin Romany \"Kate\" Beckinsale (Londres, 26 de julio de 1973) es una actriz y modelo ocasional británica con un largo recorrido, conocida por su papel como Selene en la saga Underworld entre otras películas de acción y por películas de romance como Much Ado About Nothing (1993) o Serendipity.\n\nKathrin Romany Beckinsale[2]​[3]​ nació en Chiswick, Londres, Inglaterra. Es la única hija del actor Richard Beckinsale y la actriz Judy Loe.[4]​ Su padre era de ascendencia birmana.[5]​ Hizo su primera aparición en la televisión a la edad de cuatro años, en un episodio de This is Your Life dedicado a su padre.[5]​ Cuando tenía cinco años, su padre, de 31 años de edad, murió repentinamente de un ataque al corazón. Beckinsale estaba profundamente traumatizada por la pérdida y «comenzó a esperar que sucedieran cosas malas».[6]​ Mientras que ella ha visto a su padre «más en la televisión que en vida», «sin duda hay suficientes recuerdos, para no sentir que es alguien a quien desconocía».[4]​ Su madre viuda, se mudó a vivir con el director Roy Battersby cuando Beckinsale tenía nueve años y se crio junto a sus cuatro hijos y su hija.[7]​ Guardaba una estrecha relación con su padrastro, fallecido en enero de 2024: «no podría haber un punto mejor... él no era agresivo, por lo que me dejó venir a él.»[4]​ Beckinsale tiene una media hermana paterna, la actriz Samantha Beckinsale, pero no han tenido un contacto regular.[4]​\n\nBeckinsale fue educada en el Godolphin and Latymer School, una escuela independiente (particular) para niñas ubicado en Hammersmith, en Londres del oeste[8]​ y estuvo involucrada en el Orange Tree Youth Theatre.[9]​\n\nFue dos veces ganadora del Premio WH Smith Literary en la categoría de Ciencia Ficción y Poesía.[10]​ Ella misma se ha descrito como una «flor tardía»: «Todas mis amigas estaban besando chicos y bebiendo sidra delante de mí. Me pareció muy deprimente que no estuviéramos haciendo fuego en los campamentos, porque todo el mundo fue a hacer cosas de adultos» declara.[11]​ «Yo detestaba ser una adolescente».[12]​ Tuvo una crisis nerviosa y desarrolló anorexia a la edad de 15 años por lo que se sometió a psicoanálisis freudiano durante cuatro años.[4]​\n\nBeckinsale cursó literatura francesa y rusa en el New College, Oxford, fue descrita más tarde por una de sus contemporáneas, la periodista Victoria Coren, como «un azote de inteligencia, ligeramente loca, y muy encantadora».[13]​ Beckinsale estuvo involucrada con la Sociedad Dramática de la Universidad de Oxford, su trabajo más notable lo realizó siendo dirigida por su compañero de estudios Tom Hooper en una producción de Panorama desde el puente en el Teatro Oxford.[14]​ Pasó su tercer año en París como parte de su año obligatorio en el extranjero como una estudiante de Lenguas modernas, después de lo cual se decidió dejar la universidad para concentrarse en su carrera como actriz floreciente: «estaba llegando al punto en el que no estaba disfrutando de cualquiera cosa, porque la presión era muy alta, me estaba quemando y yo sabía que tenía que tomar una decisión.»[4]​\n\nDurante su primer año en Oxford, Beckinsale recibió una oferta para actuar en la película de Kenneth Branagh Much Ado About Nothing (Mucho ruido y pocas nueces), una adaptación de la comedia de Shakespeare. Con esta película se le abrieron las puertas para intervenir en otras, lo que hizo mientras seguía estudiando en la universidad.\n\nEl tercer año de carrera universitaria lo pasó en París para familiarizarse con la cultura francesa. Después, decidió no cursar el cuarto y último año y se concentró en su carrera actoral.\n\nPosteriormente obtuvo papeles en películas de bajo presupuesto, entre ellas: Shooting Fish, Alice Through the Looking Glass y The Last Days of Disco, ambas en 1998. También participó en la serie televisiva Cold Comfort Farm. Su primera aparición en películas estadounidenses fue Brokedown Palace, en 1999, la cual no tuvo éxito comercial.\n\nEl éxito y el reconocimiento internacional llegaron en 2001, con Pearl Harbor. A la misma siguieron Serendipity, el mismo año, Underworld en 2003, y Van Helsing y El aviador, en 2004.\n\nEn enero de 2006, Beckinsale actuó en Underworld: Evolution, la secuela del filme de 2003. Su siguiente rol destacado fue en la comedia Click, producida y coprotagonizada por Adam Sandler.\n\nEn 2007 protagonizó la película de terror Vacancy, junto a Luke Wilson.\n\nEntre 2002 y 2009 Beckinsale, fue elegida como una de las mujeres más atractivas del mundo, por varias revistas como ¡Hola!, Stuff, Maxim, FHM y Esquire.\n\nEn su faceta como escritora, ha ganado varios premios con sus poemas y relatos cortos. Además, habla francés, ruso y alemán.[15]​\n\nBeckinsale ha trabajado ocasionalmente como modelo. En 1997, apareció en el video musical de George Michael, Vals Away Dreaming.[16]​ En 2002 actuó al lado de Orlando Bloom en un anuncio de televisión de Gap, dirigida por Cameron Crowe.[17]​ Apareció en un anuncio publicitario de Coca-Cola Light en 2004, dirigida por Michel Gondry.[18]​[19]​ En el 2009 Absolut Vodka anuncia una campaña de fotografía de Beckinsale realizada por Ellen von Unwerth.[20]​[21]​ También ha promovido el jabón Lux en un anuncio para la televisión japonesa.[22]​\n\nBeckinsale tuvo una relación de ocho años con el actor Michael Sheen, desde 1995 hasta 2003. Se conocieron cuando se lanzó en la producción de una gira de The Seagull a principios de 1995 y se mudaron a vivir juntos poco después.[23]​ Se ha dicho que fue «amor a primera vista»[24]​ y que la salvó de «un hospital para criminales dementes».[25]​ En 1997, apareció en una producción de radio de Romeo y Julieta.[26]​ Su hija, Lily Mo Sheen, nació en Londres en 1999. La actriz ha dicho que era «una vergüenza» que Sheen nunca se le hubiera declarado,[27]​[28]​ pero que ella se sentía como si estuviera casada: «Si tienes en tu propiedad un libro de la biblioteca durante demasiado tiempo, sientes que es tuyo».[29]​\n\nSu relación terminó a principios de 2003, después del rodaje de Underworld.[30]​ Beckinsale había convencido al director Len Wiseman para que Sheen estuviera en la película,[31]​ pero, ella y Wiseman, quien era casado, comenzaron una relación. Todas las partes, además de la primera esposa de Wiseman,[32]​ han sostenido que no hubo infidelidad, y Beckinsale y Sheen siguieron siendo amigos cercanos.[31]​[33]​ Wiseman se casó con Beckinsale el 9 de mayo de 2004 en Bel-Air, California.[34]​ En noviembre de 2015, se anunció que Beckinsale y Wiseman se estaban divorciando.[35]​\n\nEn julio de 2003, la Comisión de Quejas de Prensa desestimó una demanda presentada por Beckinsale. Beckinsale había afirmado que el Daily Mail invadió la privacidad de ella y de su hija mediante la publicación de unas fotografías donde se la ve abrazando a su hija y luego siendo besada por su nuevo novio, Len Wiseman.[36]​ El artículo fue titulado La última escena de amor de la impresionada mamá Lily e incluía una imagen en la que se aprecia a su hija, de cuatro años de edad, haciendo caso omiso de las acciones románticas de su madre.[36]​ La Comisión constató que las fotografías se habían tomado en un lugar público y que no revelaron detalles privados sobre Lily, tales como su salud o la educación, pero que estaban restringidas a la vista de la mayoría del público\".[36]​ En agosto de 2003, Beckinsale recibió una disculpa publicada desde el Daily Mail, después de que el periódico informara de que había pasado un tiempo en una clínica a raíz de la separación de su novio Michael Sheen.[37]​ La disculpa fue emitida después de que la actriz presentara una denuncia ante la Comisión de Quejas de Prensa.[37]​ En 2009, Beckinsale fue indemnizada con £20,000 libras en daños y perjuicios por el Tribunal Supremo Británico después de tomar acciones legales contra el periódico Northern & Shell.[38]​ El Daily Express falsamente había informado que la actriz se enfrentaba a la angustia después de haberse perdido una parte de la nueva versión de Barbarella.[38]​\n\nBeckinsale ha pertenecido a la Fundación Británica del Corazón «desde que tenía seis años».[39]​ También ha donado objetos de recuerdo de sus películas a la Fundación de Investigación Médica de la epidermolisis bullosa,[40]​ MediCinema,[41]​ Hábitat para la Humanidad[42]​ y la Fundación de la Industria del Entretenimiento.[43]​ En 2008 recibió el 4º Annual Pink Party para recaudar fondos para el Instituto de Investigación del cáncer de la Mujer en el Cedars-Sinai Medical Center[44]​ y organizó una proyección de Eva al desnudo para FilmAid Internacional.[45]​ En 2012 Beckinsale se unió a la jornada de Nestlé Compartir la alegría del Programa de Lectura para crear conciencia sobre la importancia de la alfabetización de los niños.[46]​"}

Known for his trickery, rapid pace, and agility, Di María is widely considered one of the greatest Argentine players of all time and one of the greatest wingers in the history of the sport.[4][5]\n\nDi María began his career with Rosario Central but first came into prominence at Benfica after signing for the club in 2007, aged 19. He helped Benfica win the Primeira Liga, the club's first league title in five years, and two Taça da Liga titles. In 2010, Di María moved to Spanish club Real Madrid in a transfer worth €25 million, where he won a 2011–12 La Liga title and the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. He signed for Manchester United in 2014 in a then-British record deal worth £59.7 million (€75.6 million) but left a year later to join Paris Saint-Germain. During his time in England, Di María was selected in the FIFPRO Men's World 11 in 2014.[6] In France, Di María won five league titles, five Coupe de France, and four Coupe de la Ligue, which includes three domestic quadruples, and helped the club reach its first Champions League final in 2020. He is also the club's ninth-highest goalscorer and all-time leader in assists. He joined Italian side Juventus for free in the summer of 2022, before returning to Benfica in 2023.\n\nDi María debuted for Argentina internationally in 2007, playing for the under-20 team; with the side, he won the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, held in Canada. Playing for the country's Olympic team at the 2008 Olympic Games, Di María scored the winning goal against Nigeria in the final to win Argentina their second successive Olympic gold medals in football. He made his senior debut for Argentina the same year, in 2008, at the age of 20, and went on to earn 145 caps, including appearing in ten major tournaments; he featured in four FIFA World Cups for Argentina; helping his country reach the final in 2014 and win their third World Cup in 2022, the first in 36 years, scoring the second goal in the final. Furthermore, Di María was also part of the Argentina squads that reached four Copa América finals, in 2015, 2016, 2021 and 2024, winning the latter two; he netted the only goal in the 2021 final to win Argentina their first trophy in 28 years. He retired from the national team after winning the 2024 Copa América final.\n\nDi María was born on 14 February 1988 in Rosario, as one of three children of Miguel di María and Diana Hernandez, and grew up in Perdriel. As an infant, he was unusually active, and on the recommendation of a doctor was signed up for football at age three. He also helped his parents with their work at a local coal yard along with his two sisters, Vanesa and Evelyn. Due to the low income his family earned, purchasing football boots and keeping up with Di María's hobby was difficult for his parents. He considers himself to be a \"family man\" and has used a significant amount of his salary to \"give back\" to his family. After being transferred to Benfica, he asked his father not to work any more and purchased a house for his parents and sisters.[8]\n\nAt age four, Di María joined Rosario Central. As he had already committed to playing for his local club, Torito, 35 footballs were given in compensation.\n\nDi María made his professional debut on 14 December 2005 in Rosario's final fixture of the Apertura, a 2–2 draw away to Independiente, by replacing Emiliano Vecchio.[9] He scored for the first time on 24 November 2006 in the following season's Apertura in a 4–2 win at home over Quilmes, a minute after replacing Leonardo Borzani at half-time.[10] After playing at the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, Boca Juniors made a bid of US$6.5 million for him.[11] He was also approached by English club Arsenal, a move that fell through due to the United Kingdom's strict rules on issuing work permits to players from outside the European Union.[12]\n\nDi María was transferred to the Portuguese side Benfica in July 2007, where he played as a winger. He was signed as a replacement for Benfica's departing captain, Simão, who joined Atlético Madrid earlier that summer.[11] Benfica paid Rosario Central €6 million for 80% of his sports rights and 50% of the sports rights of Andrés Díaz.[13] Later, in August 2008, the Portuguese club paid an extra €2 million for the remaining 20%,[14] but re-sold 10% to GestiFute.[15]\n\nDi María had his breakthrough in the 2009–10 season thanks to the trust placed in him by manager Jorge Jesus. On 22 October, in the Europa League group stage match against Everton, he provided a hat-trick of assists for the first time in his career, in a 5–0 thrashing at the Estádio da Luz, marking the biggest loss of an English side in a European competition.[16][17] During that month, Di María signed a new deal with Benfica, adding three more years to his current deal, which was to last until 30 June 2015 with his release fee set at a minimum of €40 million.[18] Afterwards, he was backed by Diego Maradona to become \"Argentina's next superstar\".[19] He would score a brace in Benfica's 2–1 home win over AEK Athens, to ensure Benfica's qualification to the round of thirty-two, as group winners.[20] On 27 February 2010, Di María scored his first hat-trick in a classic 4–0 win against Leixões. The next day, he made the headlines as \"Magic Tri María\" in all sports newspapers in Portugal.[21] He finished as the league's top assister that season with 11 assists, including two in a 5–0 win against Olhanense, as Benfica won the national championship, adding the year's domestic League Cup, while being named Player of the Month in April.[22]\n\nOn 28 June 2010, Real Madrid posted on their website that they had agreed with Benfica for the transfer of Di María. He signed a five-year contract for €25 million, plus €11 million in incentives, as announced one day later by the Portuguese Stock Exchange regulating entity.[23] On 7 July 2010, Di María arrived to Madrid directly from Buenos Aires,[24] and passed the medical test on 8 July.[25]\n\nHe made his debut on 4 August 2010 in a friendly match against Mexican side América, which Real Madrid won 3–2.[26] On 22 August, Di María scored his first goal in another friendly away against Hércules, which Real Madrid won 3–1.[27] In the last match of the pre-season, on 24 August, after an individual play described as a \"magic moment\", he opened the score of the 2–0 win against Peñarol for the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu.[28]\n\nHis league debut came on 29 August in a 0–0 draw against Mallorca.[29] On 18 September, Di María scored his first league goal for Real Madrid in their 2–1 away win over Real Sociedad.[30] Ten days later, he scored his first goal in the UEFA Champions League against Auxerre in a 1–0 victory.[31] He scored a controversial first goal against Sevilla on 19 December. Days later, Di María assisted Karim Benzema's two goals and Cristiano Ronaldo's goal in an astonishing 8–0 drubbing of Levante on 22 December. In the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Lyon, he scored the third and final goal in a 3–0 win to send Real Madrid through to the quarter-finals for the first time in seven years.[32]\n\nDi María scored Real Madrid's third goal during their first-leg Champions League quarter-final victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 April 2011.[33] On 20 April, he was sent off in the 31st minute of extra time in the Copa del Rey final against rival Barcelona. Real Madrid won the match 1–0, the lone goal of the match (in the 13th minute of extra time) being a header from Cristiano Ronaldo, which came from his cross, thus obtaining his first honour with Real Madrid.[34]\n\nDuring the start of the 2011–12 season, Di María endured a tough series of matches as he struggled to adapt to the pace of the league following the summer break. As a result, Di María's early performance for the season was mixed with moments of genuinely good play interspersed with moments of sheer madness by the Argentine. This point was well illustrated during Real Madrid's 1–0 defeat to Levante, a match which saw a clearly out-of-sorts Di María commit a horror foul on Levante's Juanfran during the match. Di María caused the two teams to clash and an on-field incident ensued. However, Di María's performances would improve, including opening up a significant gap at the top of the assists table. From October 2011, Di María was being picked by Madrid head coach José Mourinho ahead of Kaká and Mesut Özil, a sign of his improving form.[citation needed]\n\nOn 27 November 2011, Di María played 60 minutes in a league match against city rivals Atlético Madrid, in which he scored a goal for Real Madrid. Mourinho's team won the match 4–1. On 3 December 2011, Di María scored Real's first goal from a sharp angle in a 3–0 defeat of Sporting de Gijón in La Liga.[35] He was a constant threat and presence in the starting XI as Real Madrid won their 32nd league title, playing in their 3–0 win over Athletic Bilbao that clinched the league title.[36]\n\nDi María scored his first goal of the season against Barcelona in the first leg of the 2012 Supercopa de España at Camp Nou after a mistake by Barcelona goalkeeper Víctor Valdés.[37]\n\nAlthough Di María did not have the best season, he did contribute in big moments, most notably by sending in the cross for Cristiano Ronaldo's goal against Manchester United on 13 February,[38] he registered seventeen assists, and scored nine goals throughout the season in 52 appearances, notably against Atlético Madrid and Málaga. On 9 August 2012, Di María signed a new contract with Real Madrid, keeping him at the club until 2018.[39]\n\nOn 2 October 2013, Di María scored two goals against Copenhagen in Real Madrid's 4–0 Champions League victory over them.[40] Later in the season, due to tactical decisions by the club's new manager Carlo Ancelotti, Di María's playing position was permanently switched to that of an offensive–minded central midfielder, and he was frequently deployed in the starting line-up alongside Luka Modrić and Xabi Alonso in midfield in the team's 4–3–3 formation.[41] He contributed to the club's 2–1 victory over Barcelona in the 2014 Copa del Rey Final with the opening goal.[42] Di María was the top assist maker in La Liga for the season, contributing 17.[43]\n\nIn the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final against Atlético Madrid on 24 May 2014, Di María dribbled past two players before producing a save from goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

manager Louis van Gaal said he \"did not know why\".[68] On 2 August, it was reported Di María would undergo a medical ahead of a move to Paris Saint-Germain;[69] and four days later, Manchester United confirmed he had been sold to the French champions for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around £44 million, signing a four-year contract.[70][71][72][73]\n\nDi María made his Ligue 1 debut on 30 August away to Monaco as a 66th-minute substitute for Lucas, and assisted Ezequiel Lavezzi for the final goal of a 3–0 win at the Stade Louis II.[74] On 15 September, Di María scored his first goal for PSG on his UEFA Champions League debut for the club, a 2–0 win over Malmö FF at the Parc des Princes.[75] Seven days later, he registered his first goal in Ligue 1 as PSG defeated Guingamp 3–0.[76] On 23 April 2016, Di María scored the winning goal for PSG in the 2016 Coupe de la Ligue Final against Lille at the Stade de France.[77] Di María ended 2015–16 setting a new Ligue 1 record for assists in a season with 18.[78]\n\nIn the 2016–17 Champions League group stage home match against Basel on 19 October 2016, Di María scored the opening goal in the 40th minute in a 3–0 victory for PSG to register his first goal of the season.[79] On 19 November, he opened the scoring with his first Ligue 1 goal of the season in a 2–0 home win against Nantes.\n\nOn 14 February 2017, Di María scored a brace as PSG defeated Barcelona 4–0 in the first leg of 2016–17 UEFA Champions League round of 16 at the Parc des Princes.[80] On 1 April, he scored in PSG's 4–1 win over Monaco in the 2017 Coupe de la Ligue final.[81] On 8 May 2018, he played as PSG won 2–0 against Les Herbiers to clinch the 2017–18 Coupe de France.[82]\n\nOn the first leg of his side's Champions league round of 16 tie against his former club Manchester United in the 2018–19 season, Di María sustained a serious injury following a tackle from Ashley Young; however, he refused to be substituted, and in the final moments of the game, he assisted Kylian Mbappé's goal for a 2–0 win at Old Trafford.[83] Eventually, PSG lost 3–1 in the second leg and were eliminated in the round of 16 for the third consecutive season.[84]\n\nIn the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stage, Di María scored a brace in a 3–0 win over his former club Real Madrid on 18 September 2019.[85] On 18 August 2020, Di María scored a goal and recorded two assists in PSG's 3–0 Champions League semi-final victory over RB Leipzig;[86] the club went on to play against Bayern Munich in the final, but lost the match 1–0.[87]\n\nOn 23 September 2020, Di María was handed a four-match suspension for a spitting incident with Álvaro González during Le Classique 10 days earlier.[88] He would miss the league matches against Angers, Nîmes, Dijon and Nantes.[89] In a UEFA Champions League match against RB Leipzig on 4 November, Di María scored the opening goal in an eventual 2–1 defeat.[90] He made his return to league action in a match against Rennes three days later, and scored a goal to help PSG win the match 3–0.[91]\n\nIn a home match against İstanbul Başakşehir on 9 December 2020, Di María recorded two assists; he subsequently became the player with the third most assists in UEFA Champions League history with a tally of 32, only being behind Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.[92] On 12 March 2021, Di María extended his contract with Paris Saint-Germain for one more season with an option for a second.[93] On 4 May, Di María was sent off against Manchester City in the semi-finals of the Champions League for stamping on Fernandinho in an off the ball incident.[94] He was handed a three-match ban in European competitions.[95] In the 2021 Coupe de France Final, when PSG defeated Monaco by a score of 2–0, Di María broke the all-time assist record for PSG by delivering a pass for a Kylian Mbappé goal.

He was capped for the 2007 South American U-20 Championship in Paraguay. In 2007, he was called up for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada. They went on to win the tournament with Di María scoring three goals in the process.[116]\n\nOn 28 January 2008, Di María and some of his under-20s teammates were called up for the Argentina Olympic football team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

It was later announced after the match that Di María would miss the rest of the tournament due to the injury.[126] He had previously helped to create Gonzalo Higuaín's only goal of the match, which sent Argentina into the semi-finals. Argentina finished the tournament as runners-up to Germany.[127]\n\nOn 11 July, Di María was named on the ten-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Ball award for the tournament's best player.[128]\n\nOn 3 September 2014, in a friendly away against world champions Germany, Di María had a part in all four of Argentina's goals in a 4–2 victory, assisting three and scoring one.[129]\n\nOn 28 May 2015, Di María was included in Argentina national team for the 2015 Copa América.[130] On 6 June, he was selected to captain the team in the absence of Lionel Messi for a warm-up match against Bolivia, scoring twice in a 5–0 win.[131] A week later, in their opening match of the tournament against Paraguay in La Serena, Di María won a penalty which Messi scored in a 2–2 draw.[132] On 30 June, he scored twice and assisted a goal for Sergio Agüero, as Argentina defeated Paraguay 6–1 to reach the final.[133] He was substituted with a hamstring injury within the first half-hour of the final against hosts Chile, which his team lost in a penalty shootout after a goalless draw.[134]\n\nIn Argentina's opening match of the Copa América Centenario on 6 June 2016, a rematch of the previous tournament's final against defending champions Chile, Di María scored the opening goal of the match and later assisted Éver Banega's goal in a 2–1 win. Di María dedicated the goal to his grandmother, who had recently died.[135] In his nation's second group match, against Panama on 10 June, he assisted Nicolás Otamendi's opening goal, but was later forced off due to injury. Argentina won the match 5–0.[136] He missed the rest of the tournament due to injury[137] as Argentina reached the Copa América final for the second consecutive time, once again losing out to Chile on penalties, following a 0–0 draw.[138]\n\nDi María made 18 appearances in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. On 22 May 2018, Di María was named in 23-man squad by manager Jorge Sampaoli for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.[139] On 30 June, he scored a long range goal against France in a 4–3 defeat which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup in the Round of 16.[140]\n\nOn 21 May 2019, he was included in the Lionel Scaloni final 23-man Argentina squad for the 2019 Copa América.[141]\n\nIn June 2021, Di María was included in the Argentina national team for the 2021 Copa América in Brazil.[142] On 21 June, he assisted the only goal of the match, scored by Papu Gómez, in Argentina's third group match against Paraguay; the result allowed his side to progress to the quarter-finals.[143] In the final of the tournament against the hosts Brazil on 10 July, he scored the only goal of the match to give Argentina their joint record 15th Copa América title with Uruguay and their first international title since 1993. He ran onto a long pass from Rodrigo De Paul into the Brazilian penalty area. The pass was slightly deflected by Brazilian defender Renan Lodi before Di María controlled the ball with the outside of his left foot; he then chipped the ball over the goalkeeper Ederson, giving Argentina an early lead. Although he was substituted late in the second half of the match, the goal would hold as the winning effort for Argentina.[144]\n\nOn 1 June 2022, Di María scored Argentina's second goal in a 3–0 win over the reigning European champions, Italy, at Wembley Stadium in the 2022 Finalissima.[145]\n\nOn 11 November 2022, Di María was named in the final squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[146] On 26 November, he recorded an assist on Messi's opening goal in Argentina's second group match, a 2–0 win over Mexico.[147] On 18 December, Di María scored his team's second goal against France in the final, minutes after winning the penalty for the first goal as Argentina defeated France 4–2 on penalties, after the match ended 3–3 in extra-time, to win the World Cup.[148] He was surprised by the coach's decision to start him on the left and thought Scaloni was \"confused,\" but Scaloni convinced Di Maria how he wanted to game plan with him specifically on the left.[149]\n\nIn October 2023, Di María announced that he would be retiring from the national team after the 2024 Copa América.[150] In Argentina's final group match against Peru, he set-up Lautaro Martínez's first goal in a 2–0 win which saw Argentina advance to the quarter-finals after topping their group.[151] In the final against Colombia, he would wear the captain's armband after Messi went down with an injury in the 65th minute.

Argentina would win the match 1–0, marking their second consecutive Copa America triumph and third consecutive international tournament trophy. It would be Di María's final game for Argentina, ending his international career as a champion.[152]\n\nDi María is a quick, strong, tricky and talented winger who is also capable of playing as a more central attacking midfielder or on either side of the pitch, although he is predominantly a left-footed player.[153] He has also been deployed to great effect as a central midfielder, in particular under Carlo Ancelotti's tenure with Real Madrid.[41] Possessing a slender frame,[154] Di María is an agile, creative and highly technical player who possesses excellent dribbling skills and ball control, as well as great pace, stamina, movement, and acceleration, attributes which allow him to beat players easily in one-on-one situations. He is also gifted with excellent vision, set-piece delivery, passing, and crossing ability, which allow him to function effectively as a playmaker and as an assist provider, although he is also capable of scoring goals himself, and is an accurate free kick taker. Despite not being physically imposing, he is also a very hard-working player, and he improved on the defensive aspect of his game under manager José Mourinho.[155][156][157][158] Di María has also drawn praise in the media over his decisive performances in important matches throughout his career.[159] Despite his ability, however, he has often struggled with injuries throughout his career.[160]\n\nDi María is nicknamed \"Fideo\", which means \"noodle\" in Spanish, due to his slender frame.[154] Due to his Italian ancestry, he obtained an Italian passport.[161][162] He is Roman Catholic.[163]\n\nHe married fellow Argentine Jorgelina (née Cardoso) in 2011.[164] Together they have two daughters, Mia and Pia. Mia was born three months premature and survived after treatment at an intensive care unit at the Hospital Universitario Montepríncipe in Madrid.[164][165]\n\nDi María's home in Prestbury, Cheshire, was the scene of an attempted burglary on 31 January 2015.[166]\n\nOn 2 September 2020, it was reported that Di María, along with PSG teammates Neymar and Leandro Paredes, had tested positive for COVID-19. The French sports newspaper L'Équipe said that the three players reportedly went on vacation in Ibiza. As a result, they had to quarantine for one week, and the rest of the players and working staff were scheduled to take a coronavirus test within the same week.[167][168]\n\nDuring a match between PSG and Nantes on 14 March 2021, Di María's home was robbed and his family was held hostage. He had been substituted off the pitch by manager Mauricio Pochettino, who informed Di María of the situation. PSG teammate Marquinhos' parents' home was also burgled in a similar way.[169]\n\nDi María is one of the 13 sports personalities named in the Pandora Papers published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). He used a company in Panama to exploit his image rights for months before arriving at Real Madrid. He is the owner of a company in Panama created especially to manage his million-dollar contracts for the exploitation of his image rights, a shell company that he used since 2009 and that he maintains to this day. The Pandora Papers reveal that he handled more than €8 million between 2013 and 2017 through a company named Sunpex Corporation Inc.[170]\n• List of footballers with 100 or more capsÁngel Di María - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Ángel Fabián Di María (Rosario, 14 de febrero de 1988) es un futbolista argentino que juega de extremo en el S. L. Benfica de la Primeira Liga. Fue internacional con la selección de Argentina desde 2008 hasta 2024, donde se lo considera uno de los mejores exponentes de todos los tiempos.[4]​\n\nSu debut se produjo en Rosario Central el 14 de diciembre de 2005 en el empate 2-2 con Independiente.[5]​Tras ser considerado como promesa de la cantera rosarina fue fichado por el Benfica, donde disputó 45 partidos y ganó tres títulos. En 2010 llamó la atención del Real Madrid, club que lo contrató por cinco años. En el club español ganó su primera y única Liga de Campeones de la UEFA, convirtiéndose también en referente del plantel. En 2014-15 tuvo un breve paso por el Manchester United para luego fichar por el Paris Saint-Germain, donde estuvo siete años y ganó diecinueve títulos. En 2022 se desligó del PSG para ser contratado por la Juventus de Turín, donde jugó cuarenta partidos y desde allí volver al Benfica, después de trece años.\n\nDi María, y su compatriota Lionel Messi, son los únicos jugadores en la historia de este deporte que ganaron una Copa Mundial Sub-20, una medalla de oro olímpica y una Copa Mundial.[6]​ También ostenta el récord de convertir goles en tres finales distintas con la selección absoluta de Argentina (a Brasil en la Copa América 2021, a Italia en la Finalísima 2022, y a Francia en el Mundial de Catar 2022).[7]​ Además, con la selección sub-23, anotó en la final contra Nigeria en los Juegos Olímpicos de Pekín 2008. Esto lo convierte, dentro de la historia del fútbol, en uno de los cuatro futbolistas (el uruguayo Pedro Cea, y los húngaros Zoltán Czibor y Ferenc Puskás, los restantes) en anotar al menos un gol en una final olímpica y una del mundo, y el primero en lograrlo desde 1954; es uno de los dos futbolistas (junto con el brasileño Ronaldo) en marcar en una final de América y del mundo; y el único en hacerlo en una final continental, olímpica y del mundo.[8]​\n\nNació el 14 de febrero de 1988 en la ciudad de Rosario, provincia de Santa Fe, y creció en el barrio Parque Casas, ubicado en la zona norte de la ciudad. Su padre, Miguel, estuvo a punto de ser jugador profesional de fútbol en River Plate pero sufrió una lesión antes de poder debutar y se alejó de la actividad.[9]​ Miguel tenía una carbonería y Ángel desde pequeño le ayudó a armar las bolsas de carbón y repartirlas, hasta que debutó en primera división.\n\nEn su infancia, presentó un cuadro de hiperactividad, por lo que su madre Diana lo llevó a practicar fútbol, por recomendación de su pediatra. Su primer club fue El Torito, que se encontraba a pocas cuadras de la casa donde vivía con su familia.[10]​[11]​\n\nEn 1995, con seis años de edad, jugó un partido definitorio para ganar una liga local ante Rosario Central, donde anotó los dos goles de la victoria (uno de ellos olímpico).[9]​ Gracias a ese encuentro y sus actuaciones en el club (hizo 64 goles en un año) llamó la atención de Ángel Tulio Zof, quien convenció a su familia para que pasara a jugar de forma definitiva en Central.[12]​ Allí empezó a jugar baby fútbol y, desde pequeño, compartió equipo con jugadores que más tarde llegaron a primera división como Nahuel Valentini, Milton Caraglio y Emiliano Vecchio. En 2002, cuando tuvo edad de novena división, debutó en el torneo de inferiores de AFA, sin embargo compitió casi todo el año en la liga rosarina de fútbol, donde Central fue campeón. Debido a su contextura física casi no participó de las inferiores de AFA en octava división y durante el año 2004 no jugó ningún minuto en el equipo que salió campeón de séptima división. En esos torneos, en su puesto habitualmente era titular Gervasio Núñez y él siguió compitiendo en la liga rosarina. Recién en 2005 en sexta división, gracias a su buen rendimiento, tuvo la oportunidad de competir a nivel nacional con continuidad con Marcelo Trivisonno como entrenador.[13]​\n\nEn una carta que escribió muchos años después, el futbolista relató:\n\nDebutó en el primer equipo de Rosario Central en 2005 con tan solo 17 años. El técnico por ese entonces, Ángel Tulio Zof, lo hizo debutar en el empate 2-2 frente a Independiente, en la última fecha del Torneo Apertura, el 14 de diciembre de 2005. Ingresó a los 72 minutos con el dorsal 38 en reemplazo de Emiliano Vecchio.[14]​ Además del torneo local, Central afrontaba la Copa Libertadores 2006. Allí hizo su debut internacional el 9 de febrero en la derrota por 1 a 0 ante Atlético Nacional, en Colombia. Entró al partido reemplazando a Diego Calgaro a los 72 minutos.[15]​ Jugó otros tres encuentros en la fase de grupos del torneo, siempre entrando desde el banco. Su segundo partido en Primera División 2005-06 fue el 12 de febrero de 2006 por la cuarta fecha del Torneo Clausura ante Lanús. Los rosarinos perdieron 2 a 0, sin embargo este sería su primer partido como titular.[16]​ Durante el resto del torneo ingresó siempre como suplente a los partidos. Su primer gol lo marcó en el Torneo Apertura de ese mismo año, el 24 de noviembre por la decimoséptima fecha en la victoria por 4 a 2 ante Quilmes, ya correspondiente a la temporada 2006-07.[17]​\n\nDurante el Torneo Clausura 2007 se consolidó en el equipo y jugó 18 de los 19 encuentros del torneo, la mayoría como titular, formando una gran dupla con Damián Diaz. A pesar de que su equipo tuvo un torneo regular, él marcó 5 goles y se convirtió en el goleador del equipo de ese campeonato. Su último partido en Rosario Central lo jugó el 16 de junio de 2007 en la derrota por 3 a 1 ante Colón, marcando el gol de su equipo.[18]​\n\nEn el club rosarino jugó en total 39 partidos convirtiendo 6 goles hasta junio de 2007 cuando fue transferido junto a su compañero de equipo Andrés Díaz al Benfica, de Portugal, gracias a su actuación en la Copa Mundial de Fútbol Sub-20 de 2007. Antes, había sido pretendido por Boca Juniors, que había ofrecido por su fichaje la cantidad de 6.500.000 $ USA.[19]​ En enero de 2007 tuvo la oportunidad de jugar en el Rubin Kazan de Rusia, en un acuerdo que en un principio aceptó pero que acabaría rechazando.\n\nTras varias encuestas, acabó fichando con el Benfica por 6 millones de euros (aproximadamente 8,3 millones de dólares), en julio de 2007, con la intención de que sustituyera a Simão Sabrosa, que acababa de dejar el club para jugar en el Atlético de Madrid. El Benfica pagó a Rosario Central 6 millones de euros por el 80% de sus derechos deportivos y el 50% de los derechos deportivos de Andrés Díaz.[19]​ Más tarde, en agosto de 2008, el club portugués pagó 2 millones de euros adicionales por el 20% restante, pero vendió el 10% a GestiFute, una compañía portuguesa de agentes deportivos.[20]​ Tras las primeras impresiones en su primera temporada, en octubre de 2009, firmó un nuevo contrato, añadiendo tres años más a su contrato actual, que se prolongaría hasta el 30 de junio de 2015 con su tarifa de liberación fijada en un mínimo de 40 millones de euros.[21]​\n\nPero fue recién en la temporada 2009-10 cuando logró demostrar todo su potencial con la camiseta del Benfica; muchos dicen que esto sucedió gracias a la confianza que depositó en él el técnico Jorge Jesús. En el club portugués, estuvo cerca de la marca de los 100 partidos (jugó 97) y logró marcar 17 veces, hasta mayo de 2010. En la temporada 2009-10, fue el líder de asistencias, y fue considerado el mejor jugador de la liga portuguesa en ese momento. Uno de sus mejores partidos con el Benfica fue el 22 de octubre de 2009, ante el Everton, en la UEFA Europa League, en el que dio tres asistencias, siendo el resultado final 5-0 y la mayor derrota del equipo inglés en competiciones europeas hasta la fecha.[22]​[23]​ Otra de sus mejores actuaciones fue ante el Olhanense en la penúltima jornada de la liga portuguesa, tras haber realizado dos asistencias y anotando un gol en la victoria por 5-0 del Benfica.[24]​\n\nMarcó el primer hat-trick de su carrera en un partido contra el Leixões que ganó el Benfica por 4-0, pero un cuarto gol fue anulado por error, perdiendo la oportunidad de haber hecho un póquer. Antes de dejar el club, agradeció a Jorge Jesús toda la confianza que depositó en él, afirmando que hasta entonces había sido el único entrenador que había creído en su potencial como jugador.[25]​\n\nEl 28 de junio de 2010, el Real Madrid publicó en su página web que había llegado a un acuerdo con el Benfica para su traspaso. Firmó un contrato por cinco años por 25 millones de euros, más 11 millones de incentivos, según anunció un día después el ente regulador de la bolsa de valores de Portugal.[26]​[27]​[28]​ El 7 de julio de 2010, tras finalizar el Mundial de Sudáfrica, llegó a Madrid directo desde Buenos Aires y pasó su examen médico al día siguiente.[29]​\n\nSu primer partido con el Real Madrid fue un amistoso ante el Club América, que su equipo ganó por 3 a 2.[30]​ El 22 de agosto, anotó su primer gol en un amistoso contra el Hércules CF, donde su equipo ganó por 3 a 1.[31]​ En su estreno con el Real Madrid en el estadio Santiago Bernabéu marcó un gran gol de jugada individual contra Peñarol de Uruguay y su equipo logró ganar el Trofeo Santiago Bernabeu.[32]​\n\nSu debut en la liga española se produjo el 29 de agosto de 2010 ante el RCD Mallorca.[33]​ El 18 de septiembre marcó su primer gol oficial en la victoria por 2 a 1 ante la Real Sociedad.[34]​ Diez días más tarde, anotó un gol en la Copa de Europa ante el AJ Auxerre que permitió a su equipo imponerse por 1 a 0.[35]​ En el partido de vuelta de los octavos de final de la Copa de Campeones hizo el tercer y último gol en la victoria por 3 a 0 ante el Olympique de Lyon y su equipo logró pasar esa instancia por primera vez en 7 años. También anotó contra el Tottenham Hotspur por los cuartos de final, aunque el Real Madrid terminó perdiendo en semifinales con el Barcelona. El 20 de abril, se fue expulsado a los 31 minutos del tiempo extra de la final de la Copa del Rey contra el Barcelona. Sin embargo el Real Madrid ganó 1 a 0 con un gol de Cristiano Ronaldo de cabeza tras un centro suyo, obteniendo su primer título con el conjunto madrileño.\n\nEn una encuesta realizada a los lectores del periódico deportivo Marca durante 2010, fue elegido como la mejor incorporación del Real Madrid ese año.[36]​\n\nEl comienzo de la temporada 2011/12 fue destacable para él ya que durante casi toda la primera vuelta fue uno de los mejores asistidores del Madrid junto a Mesut Özil. Sin embargo una serie de lesiones a finales de 2011 y principios de 2012 le impidieron tener continuidad. A finales de temporada, ya recuperado, volvió a los terrenos y continuó colaborando aunque en menor medida que en la primera vuelta. Terminó la temporada con 7 goles en todas las competiciones y con 13 asistencias en la liga, siendo el 3° mejor asistidor solo por detrás de su compañero de equipo Mesut Özil y su compatriota Lionel Messi. Finalizó la temporada ganando la Liga BBVA que sería recordada como la Liga de los récords por los 100 puntos y 121 goles conseguidos por el Real Madrid, que supusieron un récord en toda la historia de la competición.[37]​\n\nLa temporada empezó bien para Di María, pues su equipo logró la Supercopa de España al ganarle al FC Barcelona. Ángel hizo uno de los goles del Madrid en el partido de ida al aprovechar un error del portero blaugrana Víctor Valdés: lo presionó cuando tenía la pelota, se la ganó y finalmente la empujó a las redes. Ese gol fue fundamental para el Real Madrid, pues con él llegaron al partido de vuelta con distancia de tan solo un gol. Finalmente el marcador global quedó 4-4 y el Real Madrid ganó el torneo por haber convertido más goles de visitante.[38]​\n\nAunque no tuvo la mejor temporada, sí contribuyó en los grandes momentos, entre los que destaca el envío del centro para el gol de Cristiano Ronaldo ante el Manchester United el 13 de febrero. Registró 17 asistencias y marcó 9 goles a lo largo de la temporada en 52 partidos, marcando en particular contra el Atlético de Madrid y el Málaga. El 9 de agosto de 2012 firmó un nuevo contrato con el Real Madrid, manteniéndose en el club hasta 2018.[39]​\n\nEn la temporada 2013-14, con la adquisición del extremo galés Gareth Bale y debido a decisiones tácticas del nuevo entrenador del club, Carlo Ancelotti, su posición se cambió de extremo a la de un mediocampista ofensivo, formando un trío en el centro del campo junto a Luka Modrić y Xabi Alonso en una formación 4-3-3. Contribuyó a la victoria 2-1 del equipo sobre el Barcelona en la final de la Copa del Rey 2014 con el primer gol, y fue el líder de asistencias en La Liga de la temporada, aportando 17.[40]​\n\nEn la final de la Liga de Campeones de la UEFA 2013-14 contra el Atlético de Madrid el 24 de mayo de 2014, durante el tiempo extra en el cual el partido estaba empatado 1-1, regateó a dos jugadores antes de realizar un disparo para la parada del portero Thibaut Courtois. Gareth Bale, estuvo allí para cabecear el rebote en la red en el minuto 110, dando al Real Madrid una ventaja de 2-1 sobre el Atlético en una eventual victoria por 4-1. Fue nombrado mejor jugador del partido por la UEFA y el exentrenador del Manchester United, sir Alex Ferguson, le otorgó el honor.[41]​\n\nFue un suplente no utilizado cuando el Real Madrid ganó la Supercopa de Europa 2014 contra el Sevilla el 12 de agosto.[42]​ Una semana después, en el partido de ida de la Supercopa de España, jugó los últimos 15 minutos del empate 1-1 en casa contra el Atlético de Madrid en lugar de Luka Modrić, en la que fue su última aparición en el Real Madrid.[43]​ El 22 de agosto el entrenador del equipo, Ancelotti, reveló que no lo incluyó en la convocatoria para la vuelta de la Supercopa, porque pidió ser vendido durante el verano.[44]​\n\nEl 26 de agosto de 2014 se hizo oficial su fichaje por el Manchester United en un contrato por cinco años, por 75 millones de euros más 15 millones en conceptos de variables, convirtiendo al jugador en el fichaje más caro en la historia del fútbol inglés.[45]​[46]​ Luego de esto, Di María declaró que su salida del club se debió a su poca afinidad con los directivos. Su presentación oficial fue recibida por el director técnico de los \"Diablos Rojos\" Louis van Gaal en la cual el dieron la dorsal número 7,[47]​ que fue usada previamente por leyendas del club como George Best, Bryan Robson, Éric Cantona, David Beckham y Cristiano Ronaldo.[48]​ Anotó su primer gol el 14 de septiembre, de tiro libre en la victoria por 4-0 sobre el Queens Park Rangers.[49]​[50]​[51]​ Además, en ese mismo partido asistió a Juan Mata y fue nominado al \"jugador del partido\".[52]​ En el próximo partido contra el Leicester City el 21 de septiembre de 2014, volvió a marcar un gol y proporcionó otra ayuda aunque United perdió el juego 5-3.\n\nEl 2 de octubre de 2014, ganó el premio al jugador del Manchester United del mes de septiembre, después de lograr dos goles y dos asistencias en sus primeros cuatro partidos. Continuó su racha de buena forma el 5 de octubre de 2014 al anotar un gol y proporcionar una asistencia para el colombiano Radamel Falcao en la victoria por 2-1 frente al Everton. Luego, fue sustituido por una lesión en el bíceps femoral en el minuto 13 en la derrota 3-0 contra el Hull City, el 29 de noviembre y posteriormente hizo una sola aparición de sustituto en los siguientes siete partidos.\n\nEl 4 de enero de 2015, regresó de una lesión para anotar un gol en la victoria por 2-0 contra Yeovil Town en la tercera ronda de la FA Cup. El 11 de enero, fue utilizado como delantero por el gerente de Louis van Gaal, pero no anotó, en una derrota por 1-0 a Southampton. Este nuevo papel llegó en medio de una mala racha: fue expulsado el 9 de marzo cuando perdieron 2-1 en casa ante el Arsenal en la sexta ronda de la FA Cup, siendo amonestado por simular y por agarrar la camiseta del árbitro Michael Oliver.\n\nEn febrero, unos intrusos derribaron una verja para intentar entrar en la casa de Di María en Manchester. La familia estaba cenando cuando saltó la alarma. Di María llevó a la familia a un hotel de Manchester tras el incidente.[53]​ En 2020, la mujer de Di María afirmó que la vida en Manchester era «horrible».[54]​\n\nTerminó su única temporada con 4 goles en 32 partidos.[55]​ Di María culpó al entrenador Louis van Gaal por sus dificultades de adaptación. En 2016, el jugador criticó: «Empezaba un partido en una posición y al siguiente en otra. Marcaba goles jugando en una posición y de repente, en el siguiente partido, me elegían para jugar en otra posición.».[56]​ Ya en 2024, Di María afirmó que el holandés era el peor entrenador que había tenido.[57]​ En 2019, Louis van Gaal respondió: «Di María dice que yo fui el problema. Le puse en todas las posiciones de ataque. Puede comprobarlo. Nunca me convenció en ninguna de esas posiciones. No pudo con la presión constante del balón en la Premier League. Ese era su problema».[58]​ En 2022, Louis van Gaal retomó el tema y lo atenuó: «Di María es un muy buen jugador. Jugó en el Manchester y tuvo muchos problemas personales. Entraron en su casa, robaron, y eso afectó a su nivel de rendimiento».[59]​\n\nEl 6 de agosto de 2015 se confirmó su fichaje por el Paris Saint-Germain tras varias semanas de especulaciones y habiendo sido vinculado a varios otros grandes equipos de Europa. La operación totalizó 63 millones de euros, convirtiéndolo en el segundo jugador más caro en la historia de la Ligue 1 y también en el que más dinero ha generado en términos de traspasos entre clubes (€179M).[60]​[61]​ Fue presentado al día siguiente, asignándosele el dorsal número 11.[62]​\n\nEn su primera temporada en el club francés, consiguió el triplete nacional, es decir, la Ligue 1 2015-16, la Copa de la Liga de Francia 2015-16 y la Copa de Francia 2015-16.\n\nEn el partido en casa de la fase de grupos de la Liga de Campeones 2016-17 contra el FC Basel el 19 de octubre de 2016, anotó el primer gol en el minuto 40 en la victoria por 3-0 del PSG para registrar su primer gol de la temporada. El 19 de noviembre abrió el marcador con su primer gol de la temporada en la Ligue 1 en la victoria en casa por 2-0 ante el F.C. Nantes.\n\nEl 14 de febrero de 2017, anotó un doblete cuando el PSG derrotó al Barcelona por 4-0 en el partido de ida de los octavos de final de la Liga de Campeones en el Parc des Princes. El 1 de abril, marcó en la victoria del PSG por 4-1 sobre el Mónaco en la final de la Copa de la Liga 2017. El 8 de mayo de 2018, jugó cuando el PSG ganó 2-0 a Les Herbiers para hacerse con la Copa de Francia 2017-18.\n\nEn el partido de ida de los octavos de final de la Liga de Campeones de su equipo contra su ex club Manchester United en la temporada 2018-19, Di María sufrió una lesión grave tras una entrada de Ashley Young; sin embargo, se negó a ser sustituido y, en los momentos finales del juego, ayudó al gol de Kylian Mbappé para una victoria por 0-2 en Old Trafford. Finalmente, el PSG perdió 1-3 en el partido de vuelta y fue eliminado en octavos de final por tercera temporada consecutiva.\n\nEn la fase de grupos de la Liga de Campeones de la UEFA 2019-20, Di María marcó un doblete en la victoria por 3-0 sobre su antiguo club, el Real Madrid, el 18 de septiembre de 2019. El 18 de agosto de 2020, Di María anotó un gol y registró dos asistencias en la victoria por 3-0 en la semifinal de la Liga de Campeones del PSG sobre el RB Leipzig; el club jugó contra el Bayern de Múnich en la final, pero perdió el partido 1–0.\n\nEn 2021 ganó la Copa de Francia y la Supercopa de Francia con el Paris, logrando concretar 18 asistencias y convirtiendo 6 goles en 43 presencias.\n\nEn 2022, tras pocas presencias y actuaciones no muy relevantes, nuevamente coronó la Ligue 1 y se especuló una posible salida a la Juventus de Turín ya que el PSG no le renovaría el contrato que vencía en junio de ese mismo año.[63]​[64]​ El 21 de mayo de 2022, disputó su último partido frente a FC Metz, en el que logró convertir su último gol con el Paris, y se retiró en el minuto 73' con una ovación de la hinchada y un pasillo de honor hecho por sus compañeros que se encontraban en el campo.[65]​[66]​\n\nEl 8 de julio de 2022, el conjunto turinés confirmó su fichaje por una temporada.[67]​ Hizo su debut en el club el 15 de agosto, contra el Sassuolo Calcio, en el primer partido de la temporada de la Serie A de la Juventus; marcó el primer gol al minuto 26' y luego asistió al segundo gol de Dušan Vlahović en la victoria por 3-0, pero fue sustituido en la segunda mitad debido a una lesión.[68]​[69]​ En una derrota por 2-1 ante su ex club, el Benfica, el 15 de septiembre, hizo su aparición número 100 en la Liga de Campeones de la UEFA y debutó con la Juventus en esa competencia.[70]​\n\nEl 23 de febrero de 2023, anotó el tercer hat-trick de su carrera en una victoria por 3-0 en la Liga Europa de la UEFA sobre el Nantes.[71]​[72]​\n\nDi María firmó un contrato de un año con el Benfica el 6 de julio de 2023 y fue presentado ante 2500 aficionados en la entrada del Estádio da Luz.[73]​\n\nHizo su debut de regreso con el Benfica el 9 de agosto, anotando el primer gol en una victoria por 2-0 en el O Clássico contra el Porto, equipo ganador de la Copa de Portugal, en la edición 2023 de la Supercopa de Portugal, ganando su cuarto trofeo con el club y su primer trofeo de regreso.[74]​\n\nDurante enero de 2007 el mediocampista jugó con la selección de fútbol de Argentina sub-20 en el Campeonato Sudamericano. Jugó 3 de los 4 partidos de la fase de grupos y marcó dos goles en el empate 3 a 3 con Uruguay. Participó de tres de los cinco partidos de la fase final y su seleccionado terminó segundo, lo que permitió clasificarse para la Copa Mundial de Fútbol Sub-20 de 2007 y los Juegos Olímpicos de Pekín 2008. Durante junio de 2007 Di María fue seleccionado para participar del Mundial sub-20. Jugó los dos primeros partidos de la primera fase, y le anotó un gol a Panamá en la goleada de 6-0. Anotó en los octavos de final ante Polonia en la victoria 3-1 de Argentina. Fue titular ante México en los cuartos de final aunque se fue reemplazado en el segundo tiempo. En las semifinales anotó ante Chile en la victoria 3-0. No pudo disputar la final ante la República Checa ya que se lesionó en el comienzo del segundo tiempo al chocar con el jugador chileno Arturo Vidal.[75]​ En total anotó 3 goles y su equipo fue campeón del mundo.\n\nEn 2008 volvió a defender a su selección participando en los Juegos Olímpicos de Pekín 2008. Empezó el torneo como suplente, ingresó desde el banco en el primer partido ante Costa de Marfil en el segundo tiempo en reemplazo de Ezequiel Lavezzi. El partido terminó 2 a 1 a favor del seleccionado argentino. En el segundo encuentro ante Australia ingresó en el segundo tiempo en lugar de Sergio Agüero y envió el centro para que Lavezzi haga el único gol del partido. Además pateó un penal a los 79 minutos que fue atajado por el arquero Stojkovic. Jugó la totalidad del partido ante Serbia por el último encuentro de la fase de grupos.\n\nEn cuartos de final Argentina enfrentó a Países Bajos y Di María fue titular. El partido finalizó 1 a 1 en los 90 minutos por lo que se debió jugar tiempo suplementario. Ángel fue quien a los 104 minutos convirtió el gol de la clasificación para su selección. En las semifinales Argentina se midió con Brasil a quien derrotó por 3 a 0 (Di María jugó la totalidad del partido).\n\nEl partido por la medalla de oro fue el 23 de agosto de 2008 ante Nigeria. Di María fue titular y convirtió el único gol del encuentro durante el segundo tiempo, por lo que su selección pudo defender el título ganado en los Juegos Olímpicos de Atenas 2004.\n\nLuego de su desempeño en los Juegos Olímpicos de Pekín 2008, el jugador fue convocado para las eliminatorias de clasificación para el Mundial de Sudáfrica 2010. Hizo su debut el 6 de septiembre de 2008 ante Paraguay. Su segundo partido con la albiceleste fue contra Venezuela entrando en reemplazo por Maxi Rodríguez a los 74 minutos del partido.[76]​ En su tercer partido, se hizo expulsar irresponsablemente en el encuentro ante Bolivia por agresión. Argentina terminó perdiendo dicho encuentro por una histórica goleada de 6-1 y posteriormente el tribunal de disciplina de la Conmebol le dio 4 fechas de suspensión por aquella agresión.[77]​ Su regreso a las eliminatorias fue el 10 de octubre de 2009 ante Perú, donde su seleccionado ganó el partido sobre la hora con un gol de Martín Palermo. Ángel fue titular en la última fecha ante Uruguay donde Argentina logró clasificar a la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2010. Se fue reemplazado a los 75 minutos por Fabián Monzón.\n\nCon motivo de preparación para la Copa del Mundo, Argentina jugó varios amistosos en lo que restaba del año 2009 y el primer semestre de 2010. Fue titular en la derrota ante España el 14 de noviembre de 2009. Marcó su primer gol con la selección mayor el 22 de diciembre de ese año ante el seleccionado de Cataluña, en la derrota por 4 a 2. Durante 2010 participó en los encuentros ante Alemania en Berlín, en la victoria por 1 a 0, y ante Canadá en Buenos Aires donde marcó un gol en la victoria por 5-0.\n\nÁngel fue uno de los 23 seleccionados por Diego Maradona para jugar la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2010 que se llevó a cabo en Sudáfrica. Inició su participación en el Mundial en la victoria por 1 a 0 ante Nigeria en el primer partido de la fase de grupos. Ángel jugó 85 minutos y se fue reemplazado por Nicolás Burdisso. Volvió a formar parte del once inicial ante Corea del Sur, donde jugó la totalidad del partido que Argentina ganó por 4 a 1. En el último partido de la primera ronda ante Grecia, Maradona dispuso mayoría de suplentes para disputar el partido. Ángel ingreso a los 65' en reemplazo de Maxi Rodríguez y su equipo ganó 2 a 0.\n\nArgentina con 9 puntos terminó primero del grupo B y debió enfrentarse a México por octavos de final. Una vez más Di María fue titular y se fue reemplazado a los 79 minutos por Jonás Gutiérrez. Su selección ganó 3 a 1 y clasificó a cuartos de final donde tuvo que enfrentar a Alemania. Ángel fue elegido como titular para ese partido aunque Argentina quedó eliminada de la Copa del Mundo al perder por 4 a 0.\n\nSi bien Di María jugó los 5 partidos del mundial, su rendimiento fue cuestionado por muchos. Él mismo aclaró que no se sintió cómodo en el lugar donde lo hicieron jugar y que se fue disconforme con su rendimiento.[78]​\n\nComenzándose un nuevo ciclo, llega el entrenador Sergio Batista como nuevo director técnico de la selección Argentina y Di María fue convocado para disputar los amistosos de preparación para la Copa América 2011 que se realizó en Argentina. Disputó un total de 7 encuentros y marcó 2 goles: ante Irlanda el 11 de agosto de 2010 en Dublín en la victoria por 1 a 0 y ante Portugal el 9 de febrero de 2011 en la victoria por 2 a 1 en Ginebra.\n\nEl 25 de junio de 2011 quedó confirmada la participación de Di María en la Copa América de ese año. No inició su participación como titular, comenzó el primer partido de la fase de grupos ante Bolivia en el banco. Ingresó en el entretiempo en lugar de Esteban Cambiasso y el partido finalizó 1 a 1. Ángel no jugó en el segundo partido ante Colombia donde su selección empató 0 a 0. Fue titular en el último partido de la primera ronda ante Costa Rica donde marcó un gol en la victoria por 3 a 0 que permitió la clasificación a cuartos de final.\n\nArgentina enfrentó a Uruguay por cuartos de final y Ángel participó del once inicial. Se fue reemplazado en el segundo tiempo por Javier Pastore. El partido finalizó 1-1 en el tiempo reglamentario, por lo que debieron jugarse 30 minutos más donde los equipos no se sacaron diferencia y Argentina quedó eliminada por penales 5 a 4.\n\nLuego de la eliminación en la Copa América, Argentina jugó dos partidos amistosos en Asia ante Venezuela y Nigeria, donde Di María anotó un gol.\n\nÁngel fue convocado en octubre de 2011 por Alejandro Sabella (el nuevo entrenador de su seleccionado) para las dos primeras fechas de la clasificación para el Mundial de Brasil 2014. Fue titular en ambos partidos ante Chile (donde dio dos asistencias de gol) y ante Venezuela. Fue convocado para la tercera y cuarta fecha que se disputó en ese mismo año, pero una lesión muscular no le permitió jugar por lo que fue reemplazado por Ricky Álvarez. Para la quinta fecha fue titular ante Ecuador donde anotó un gol y asistió a Sergio Agüero en el primer tanto de la victoria por 4 a 0.\n\nSu siguiente partido para la selección fue un amistoso en Nueva Jersey el 9 de junio de 2012 ante Brasil (que se estaba preparando para los Juegos Olímpicos). Asistió a Messi en el segundo gol de Argentina de la victoria por 4 a 3. En agosto de 2012 fue convocado a jugar un amistoso contra Alemania en Frankfurt en el que marcó un gol de 40 metros demostrando un alto rendimiento durante todo el encuentro.[79]​ En la séptima fecha de eliminatorias convirtió el primer gol de la victoria por 3 a 1 ante Paraguay.[80]​ Continuó como titular ante Perú, Uruguay y Chile, sin embargo no pudo jugar en la fecha número 11 ante Venezuela por llegar al límite de amarillas.\n\nEn febrero de 2013 fue parte del equipo que derrotó a Suecia por 3 a 2 y asistió a Sergio Agüero en el segundo gol argentino. Volvió a jugar por las eliminatorias ante Bolivia en la fecha 12: allí destacó por su rendimiento físico a pesar de encontrarse a más de 3600 metros de altura.[81]​ Continuó como titular de su selección en los empates ante Colombia y Ecuador por las eliminatorias aunque fue desafectado de la convocatoria para un amistoso ante Guatemala por motivos personales.[82]​ El 14 de agosto de 2013 disputó un partido amistoso ante Italia en homenaje al papa Francisco. Jugó los dos últimos partidos por eliminatorias: ante Paraguay (hizo un gol) y ante Perú. Hacia finales del año jugó otros dos amistosos ante Bosnia y Herzegovina y Ecuador.\n\nEn marzo de 2014 jugó un amistoso contra Rumania que terminó 0 a 0. El 2 de junio de 2014 se confirmó su convocatoria para la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2014. Semanas antes de la Copa del Mundo jugó dos amistosos en Argentina, ante Trinidad y Tobago y Eslovenia.\n\nDi María fue titular en los tres partidos de la fase de grupo de la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2014, donde Argentina ganó los tres y clasificó como primero del grupo. Convirtió el único gol de la victoria en octavos de final contra Suiza, cuando faltaban cuatro minutos del tiempo extra para el final del encuentro.\n\nFue titular en los cuartos de final ante Bélgica pero sufrió una lesión muscular en el primer tiempo y tuvo que ser reemplazado a los 33 minutos. Por motivo de su desgarro no jugó las semifinales contra Países Bajos donde Argentina pasó por penales a la final del torneo. Durante los días previos a la final se especuló que Ángel podía llegar a recuperarse a tiempo para el último partido pero el día previo se resintió de su lesión y no pudo jugarlo. Argentina perdió la final 1 a 0 con Alemania en tiempo extra, y si bien Lionel Messi ganó el balón de oro del torneo, Di María fue uno de los nominados a ganarlo.\n\nArgentina debutó en la Copa América 2015 celebrada en Chile el 13 de junio contra la selección de Paraguay, en un partido que finalizó con un empate 2 a 2 tras una gran remontada del elenco guaraní. Di María tuvo un discreto cometido en este primer lance, sin embargo, en los otros dos partidos de la fase de grupos, que Argentina ganó sucesivamente a Uruguay por 1-0 y Jamaica por el mismo marcador, fue uno de los protagonistas, siendo figura destacada en ambos encuentros, e incluso siendo elegido como el Jugador del Partido en este último. Argentina ganó su grupo de manera invicta, clasificando así a los cuartos de final.\n\nEn la fase final del torneo Argentina se encontraría primero con Colombia, que llegaba a esta instancia tras clasificarse como el segundo mejor tercero de la fase de grupos. El partido fue muy disputado, teniendo al colombiano David Ospina como figura del encuentro al parar varias situaciones de gol clarísimas. Di María tuvo una activa participación en el encuentro, que finalizó 0-0 y se definió por lanzamientos penales. Aquí tendría su revancha Carlos Tévez, que tras haber fallado el penal decisivo contra Uruguay en 2011, convirtió su lanzamiento en gol y selló el paso de Argentina a las semifinales.\n\nEn la semifinal la selección argentina se cruzó nuevamente con Paraguay, esperando no repetir los errores que llevaron a perder sus dos primeros puntos. El partido empezó bien para los argentinos ya que Marcos Rojo abrió la cuenta a los 15'. En el segundo tiempo vendría todo el poderío ofensivo de los albicelestes con Di María anotando un doblete en tan solo 5 minutos, el primero con un remate cruzado dentro del área tras pase de Pastore venciendo a Justo Villar y el segundo tras capturar un rebote del mismo Pastore y definiendo a arco vacío, precedido por una magistral jugada de Lionel Messi. El partido terminó con un abultado marcador de 6-1 y Argentina clasificó a la final del campeonato por tercera vez en las últimas cuatro ediciones.\n\nEl partido final vería enfrentados a Chile y Argentina, en una final bastante esperada por la rivalidad de ambas naciones. Di María comenzó el partido como titular, pero salió reemplazado a los 29 minutos de juego por Ezequiel Lavezzi debido a una lesión muscular. El partido llegó a los tiempos extra con un marcador sin goles y luego a los penales. Chile resultó vencedor por 4-1 en esa modalidad y terminó levantando el trofeo frente a una selección argentina visiblemente decepcionada por el resultado y por haber perdido su segunda final consecutiva en dos años.\n\nEstos resultados adversos pusieron en tela de juicio la continuidad de Di María y otros referentes históricos del equipo nacional. Se sumó una performance de nivel regular a bajo en los partidos valederos para la clasificación del Mundial de 2018.[83]​ Argentina perdió su primer partido en casa por 2-0 ante Ecuador y empató sin goles de visitante contra Paraguay; sufrió la caída en el partido de vuelta con Paraguay (0-1), un empate en 0 con Venezuela y otro con Perú; a lo que se sumó una quita de puntos a Bolivia por la inclusión indebida de Nelson Cabrera.[84]​ El equipo terminó clasificando agónicamente gracias al triunfo de visitante contra Ecuador (3-1) aunque los cuestionamientos no cesaron.\n\nEn la Copa Mundial de Fútbol de 2018, Ángel Di María jugó su tercer Mundial con la Selección Argentina. En el partido de octavos de final contra Francia marcó un gran gol para abrir el encuentro, sin embargo, no fue suficiente para evitar la derrota por 4:3 y la consiguiente eliminación de la Copa.\n\nFue convocado nuevamente para disputar una nueva Copa América, la quinta en su carrera.

It is usually manufactured as a powder from corn gluten meal. Zein is one of the best understood plant proteins.[1] Pure zein is clear, odorless, tasteless, hard, water-insoluble, and edible, and it has a variety of industrial and food uses.[2][3]\n\nHistorically, zein has been used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric,[4] buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \"Vicara\".[2][5] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.[6][7] It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability.[8]\n\nZein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \"confectioner's glaze\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products[9] or as \"vegetable protein.\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs.[citation needed]\n\nZein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.[10][11] With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.[12][13] Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications.[citation needed]\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.[14] They are also studying medical applications such as using the zein molecule to \"carry biocompounds to targeted sites in the human body\".[15] There are a number of potential food safety applications that may be possible for zein-based packaging according to several researchers. A military contractor is researching the use of zein to protect MRE food packages.[16] Other packaging/food safety applications that have been researched include frozen foods,[17] ready-to-eat chicken,[18] and cheese and liquid eggs.[19] Food researchers in Japan have noted the ability of the zein molecule to act as a water barrier.[20]\n\nWhile there are numerous existing and potential uses for zein, the main barrier to greater commercial success has been its historic high cost until recently. Zein pricing is now very competitive with food shellac. Zein may be extracted as a byproduct in the manufacturing process for ethanol[21] or in new off-shore manufacture.[citation needed]\n\nAlpha-prolamins are the major seed storage proteins of species of the grass tribe Andropogoneae. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication.[22] In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes;[23] twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.[24]ZO® Skin Health | Medical Skin Care: The season of gifting brings about so many questions of what to get for your loved ones.

The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[2] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The ceremony is usually held in June.\n\nThe awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[3]\n\nThe awards were founded by theatre producer and director Brock Pemberton. They are named after Antoinette \"Tony\" Perry, an actress, producer and theatre director who was co-founder and secretary of the American Theatre Wing. The trophy consists of a spinnable medallion, with faces portraying an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks, mounted on a black base with a pewter swivel.\n\nThe rules for the Tony Awards are set forth in the official document \"Rules and Regulations of The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards\", which applies for that season only.[4] The Tony Awards are the New York theatre industry's equivalent to the Emmy Awards for television, the Grammy Awards for music, and the Academy Awards (Oscars) for film. A person who has won all four is said to have won the EGOT. The Tony Awards are the U.S. equivalent of the United Kingdom's Laurence Olivier Awards and France's Molière Awards.\n\nAs of 2014 , there were 26 categories of awards, in addition to several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called \"Best Author (Musical).\" The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960.[5]\n\nA newly established non-competitive award, The Isabelle Stevenson Award, was given for the first time at the awards ceremony in 2009. The award is for an individual who has made a \"substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of one or more humanitarian, social service or charitable organizations.\"[6]\n\nThe category of Best Special Theatrical Event was retired as of the 2009–2010 season.[7] The categories of Best Sound Design of a Play and Best Sound Design of a Musical were retired as of the 2014–2015 season.[8] On April 24, 2017, the Tony Awards administration committee announced that the Sound Design Award would be reintroduced for the 2017–2018 season.[9]\n\nThe award was founded in 1947 by a committee of the American Theatre Wing (ATW), headed by Brock Pemberton. The award is named after Antoinette Perry, nicknamed Tony, an actress, director, producer and co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, who died in 1946.[10] As her official biography at the Tony Awards website states, \"At [Warner Bros. story editor] Jacob Wilk's suggestion, [Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and technical achievement. At the initial event in 1947, as he handed out an award, he called it a Tony. The name stuck.\"[11] Nevertheless, the awards were sometimes referred to as the \"Perry Awards\" in their early years.[12][13]\n\nThe 1st Tony Awards was held on April 6, 1947, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City.[14] The first prizes were \"a scroll, cigarette lighter and articles of jewelry such as 14-carat gold compacts and bracelets for the women, and money clips for the men\".[15] ATW co-founder Louise Heims Beck was responsible for overseeing the organization of the first awards.[16] It was not until the third awards ceremony in 1949 that the first Tony medallion was given to award winners.[15]\n\nSince 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in The New York Times: \"What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said...\"[17][18] The viewership has declined from the early years of its broadcast history (for example, the number of viewers in 1974 was 20 million; in 1999, 9.2 million) but has settled into between six and eight million viewers for most of the decade of the 2000s.[19] In contrast, the 2009 Oscar telecast had 36.3 million viewers.[20]\n\nThe Tony Award medallion was designed by art director Herman Rosse and is a mix of mostly brass and a little bronze, with a nickel plating on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel.[21] The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.[22][23]\n\nA larger base was introduced and first presented in the 2010 award ceremony. That base is slightly taller – 5 inches (13 cm), up from 3+1⁄4 inches (8.3 cm) – and heavier – 3+1⁄2 pounds (1.6 kg), up from 1+1⁄2 pounds (680 grams). This change was implemented to make the award \"feel more substantial\" and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners, according to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing:\n\nFor the specific Tony Awards presented to a Broadway production, awards are given to the author and up to two of the producers free of charge. All other members of the above-the-title producing team are eligible to purchase the physical award. Sums collected are designed to help defray the cost of the Tony Awards ceremony itself. An award cost $400 as of at least 2000, $750 as of at least 2009, and, as of 2013, had been $2,500 \"for several years\", according to Tony Award Productions.[25]\n\nFor the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not \"determined… to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire\", as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations).[4] The rule about \"classic\" productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) \"A play or musical that is determined ... to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category.\"[27] Shows transferred from Off-Broadway or the West End are eligible as \"new\", as are productions based closely on films.\n\nThis rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows, such as Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Violet,[28] have been ruled ineligible for the \"new\" category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people[who?] feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as \"new\" gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.\n\nThe Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors' Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. This committee, among other duties, determines eligibility for nominations in all awards categories.[29]\n\nThe Tony Awards Nominating Committee makes the nominations for the various categories. This rotating group of theatre professionals is selected by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. Nominators serve three-year terms and are asked to see every new Broadway production.[30] The Nominating Committee for the 2012–13 Broadway season (named in June 2012) had 42 members;[31] the Nominating Committee for the 2014–2015 season has 50 members and was appointed in June 2014.[30]\n\nThere are approximately 868 eligible Tony Award voters (as of 2014),[26] a number that changes slightly from year to year. The number was decreased in 2009 when the first-night critics were excluded as voters.[32][33] That decision was changed, and members of the New York Drama Critics' Circle were invited to be Tony voters beginning in the 2010–2011 season.[34]\n\nThe eligible Tony voters include the board of directors and designated members of the advisory committee of the American Theatre Wing, members of the governing boards of Actors' Equity Association, the Dramatists Guild, the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, United Scenic Artists, and the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, members of the Theatrical Council of the Casting Society of America and voting members of The Broadway League (in 2000, what was then The League of American Theaters and Producers changed membership eligibility and Tony voting status from a lifetime honor to all above-the-title producers, to ones who had been active in the previous 10 years. This action disenfranchised scores of Tony voters, including Gail Berman, Harve Brosten, Dick Button, Tony Lo Bianco, and Raymond Serra).\n\nTo be eligible for Tony Award consideration, a production must have officially opened on Broadway by the eligibility date that the Management Committee establishes each year. For example, the cut-off date for eligibility the 2013–2014 season was April 24, 2014.[35] The season for Tony Award eligibility is defined in the Rules and Regulations.\n\nIn 2020, the 74th Annual Tony Awards were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[36] On August 21, 2020, it was announced that the 74th Annual Tony Awards would take place digitally later in 2020.[37]\n\nA Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements. While the rules define a Broadway theatre in terms of its size, not its geographical location, the list of Broadway theatres is determined solely by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. As of the 2016–2017 season, the list consisted solely of 41 theaters: 40 located in the vicinity of Times Square in New York City and Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater.[38][39]\n\nWhile the theatre-going public may consider the Tony Awards to be the Oscars of live theatre, critics have suggested that the Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City.[40][41] In a 2014 Playbill article, Robert Simonson wrote that \"Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, what they get to perform, and for how long, have long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community...\" The producers \"accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales.\" Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, \"you're going to spike at the box office\".[42]\n\nThe awards met further criticism when they eliminated the sound design awards in 2014.[43] In 2014, a petition calling for the return of the Sound Design categories received more than 30,000 signatures.[44] Addressing their previous concerns over Tony voters[45] in the category, it was announced that upon the awards' return for the 2017–2018 season, they would be decided by a subset of voters based on their expertise.[9][46][47]\n\nSome advocates of gender equality and non-binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the Tony Awards, Academy Awards, and Emmy Awards. Though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories, other categories are unsegregated. The Grammy Awards went gender-neutral in 2012, while the Daytime Emmy Awards introduced a single Outstanding Younger Performer in a Drama Series category in 2019 to replace their two gender-specific younger actor and actress categories.[48][49] In 2023, J. Harrison Ghee and Alex Newell became the first nonbinary actors to be nominated for Tony Awards. Both would go on to win in their respective categories. Fellow nonbinary performer Justin David Sullivan withdrew from Tony consideration due to the gendered categories.[50]Uta Hagen - Wikipedia: Uta Thyra Hagen (12 June 1919 – 14 January 2004) was a German-American actress and theatre practitioner. She originated the role of Martha in the 1962 Broadway premiere of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee, who called her \"a profoundly truthful actress.\" Because Hagen was on the Hollywood blacklist, in part because of her association with Paul Robeson, her film opportunities dwindled and she focused her career on New York theatre.\n\nShe later became a highly influential acting teacher at New York's Herbert Berghof Studio and authored best-selling acting texts, Respect for Acting, with Haskel Frankel,[1] and A Challenge for the Actor. Her most substantial contributions to theatre pedagogy were a series of \"object exercises\" that built on the work of Konstantin Stanislavski and Yevgeny Vakhtangov.\n\nShe was elected to the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981.[2] She twice won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1999.\n\nBorn in Göttingen, Germany,[3] daughter of Thyra A. (née Leisner), a trained opera singer, and Oskar Hagen,[4] an art historian and musician, Hagen and her family emigrated to the United States in 1924. Uta was raised in Madison, Wisconsin; her father taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.[5] Her early years in Germany were likely affected by the growing political changes in Europe, which would have added a layer of complexity to their decision to emigrate. She appeared in productions of the University of Wisconsin High School and in summer stock productions of the Wisconsin Players. She later studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London for a brief period in 1936. She studied acting briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1936.[6] After spending one semester at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where her father was the head of the department of art history, she left for New York City in 1937.[7] Her first professional role was as Ophelia opposite Eva Le Gallienne in the title role of Hamlet in Dennis, Massachusetts, in 1936.[3]\n\nHagen was cast, early on, as Ophelia by the actress-manager Eva Le Gallienne. Hagen went on to play (at age 18) the leading ingénue role of Nina in a Broadway production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.[3] \"The Lunts,\" she later stated, \"were an enormous influence on my life.\" She admired \"their passion for the theatre, and their discipline.\"[8] The New York Times' critic Brooks Atkinson hailed her Nina as \"grace and aspiration incarnate.\"[9]\n\nShe played George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan (1951) on Broadway, and Desdemona in a production which toured. Later she acted with Paul Robeson in Shakespeare's Othello; her then-husband José Ferrer was Iago. She took over the role of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire for the national tour, which was directed by Harold Clurman. In Respect for Acting, she credited her discoveries with Clurman as the springboard for what she would later explore with her husband Herbert Berghof: \"how to find a true technique of acting, how to make a character flow through me.\" She played Blanche (on the road and on Broadway) opposite at least four different Stanley Kowalskis, including Anthony Quinn and Marlon Brando.\n\nPrimarily noted for stage roles, Hagen won her first Tony Award in 1951 for her performance as the self-sacrificing wife Georgie in Clifford Odets' The Country Girl. She won again in 1963 for originating the role of Martha in Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. In 1981 she was elected to the American Theater Hall of Fame and in 1999 received a \"Special Lifetime Achievement Tony Award.\"\n\nAlthough she appeared in some movies after 1972, the Hollywood blacklist limited her output in film and television. She would later comment about being blacklisted, \"that fact kept me pure.\"[3]\n\nShe was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as \"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\" for her performance on the television soap opera One Life to Live.\n\nShe taught at HB Studio, a New York City acting school. She began there in 1947, and married its co-founder, Herbert Berghof, on 25 January 1957. Hagen was an influential acting teacher who taught, among others, Matthew Broderick, Christine Lahti, Amanda Peet, Hope Davis, Jason Robards, Sigourney Weaver, Katie Finneran, Liza Minnelli, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Charles Nelson Reilly, Manu Tupou, Debbie Allen, Herschel Savage, George Segal, Jon Stewart, and Al Pacino. She was a voice coach to Judy Garland, teaching her a German accent for the picture Judgment at Nuremberg.[10] Garland's performance earned her an Academy Award nomination.\n\nLater in life, Hagen returned to the stage, earning accolades for leading roles in Mrs. Warren's Profession (1985), Collected Stories, and Mrs. Klein. After Berghof's death in 1990, she became the school's chairperson.[11]\n\nShe also wrote Respect for Acting (1973) and A Challenge for the Actor (1991), which advocate realistic (as opposed to \"formalistic\") acting. In her mode of realism, the actor puts his own psyche to use in finding identification with the role,\" trusting that a form will result.[12] In Respect for Acting, Hagen credited director Harold Clurman with a turn-around in her perspective on acting:\n\nIn 1947, I worked in a play under the direction of Harold Clurman. He opened a new world in the professional theatre for me. He took away my 'tricks'. He imposed no line readings, no gestures, no positions on the actors. At first I floundered badly because for many years I had become accustomed to using specific outer directions as the material from which to construct the mask for my character, the mask behind which I would hide throughout the performance. Mr Clurman refused to accept a mask. He demanded ME in the role. My love of acting was slowly reawakened as I began to deal with a strange new technique of evolving in the character. I was not allowed to begin with, or concern myself at any time with, a preconceived form. I was assured that a form would result from the work we were doing.\n\nHagen later \"disassociated\" herself from Respect for Acting.[8] In Challenge for the Actor, she redefined a term which she had initially called \"substitution,\" an esoteric technique for mixing elements of an actor's life with his/her character work, calling it \"transference\" instead. Respect for Acting was used as a textbook for many college acting classes. She also wrote a 1976 cookbook, Love for Cooking. In 2002, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President George W. Bush at a ceremony held at the White House.\n\nHarvey Korman talks about studying under her during his Archive of American Television interview in 2004.[13] David Hyde Pierce worked with Hagen in the Richard Alfieri play Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks, at the Geffen Playhouse in 2001.[14] Hyde Pierce spoke at her 2004 memorial at Manhattan's Majestic Theater.[15]\n\nUta Hagen was married to José Ferrer from 1938 until 1948.[3] They had one child together, their daughter Leticia (born 15 October 1940). They divorced partly because of Hagen's long-concealed affair with Paul Robeson, her co-star in Othello. Hagen married Herbert Berghof on 25 January 1957, a union that lasted for 33 years until his death in 1990. Hagen died in Greenwich Village in 2004 after suffering a stroke in 2001.[3]\n\nIn 2009, Weird Al Yankovic’s “Skipper Dan” referenced Uta Hagen in the opening verse:\n• Her name was in the song La Vie Bohème from the 1996 rock opera Rent written and composed by Jonathan Larson: \"To the stage, To Uta, To Buddha, Pablo Neruda too.\" 20\n• 1999 Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 23\n• \"Once in a while, there's stuff that makes me say, 'That's what theatre's about'. It has to be a human event on the stage, and that doesn't happen very often.\" 24\n• \"Awards don't really mean much.\" 25\n• Uta Hagen and Herbert Berghof papers, 1889–2004 at Billy Rose Theatre Division at the New York Public Library, Library for the Performing ArtsUta Hagen: Master Teacher: Legendary actress, teacher, and author Uta Thyra Hagen was born on June 12, 1919 in Göttingen, Germany to an artistic family. Her mother was a Danish opera singer and teacher, and her father started the Handel Opera Festival in Göttingen. Six years after Hagen’s birth, the family emigrated to the United States, moving to Madison, Wisconsin. It was here, in the Midwest, where Hagen was raised until the age of sixteen.\n\nDetermined to be an actress from an early age, Hagen performed in school plays and read the works of celebrated playwrights Shakespeare, Goethe, and Moliere. After her graduation from Wisconsin High School, she continued brief studies at London’s Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the University of Wisconsin, where she made her first stage appearance as Sorrel in Noël Coward’s HAY FEVER and said of her experience, “In Bascom Hall at the University of Wisconsin I started to believe, perhaps I was an actress.”\n\nIn 1937, Hagen achieved her first professional role as Ophelia in Le Gallienne’s production of HAMLET at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. The following year, Hagen went on to play the leading role of Nina in her first Broadway production of Anton Chekhov’s THE SEAGULL. Hagen was just 18 at the time.\n\nIn the longest-running Shakespearean production ever in the history of Broadway, Hagen played Desdemona, opposite Paul Robeson as Othello and her then-husband Jose Ferrer as Iago (1943-44). She took the Broadway stage again in the replacement role of Blanche DuBois in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, and later for the national tour, which closed in 1949.\n\nIt was in the 1947 Broadway production of THE WHOLE WORLD OVER, directed by Harold Clurman, where Hagen met her co-star and future husband, Herbert Berghof. That fall, she would join the faculty at Herbert Berghof Studio (HB Studio) where she taught tirelessly until the end of her life.\n\nHagen originated the role of Georgie Elgin in Clifford Odets’ THE COUNTRY GIRL, winning her first Tony Award in 1951. Hagen also played George Bernard Shaw’s SAINT JOAN on Broadway that same year.\n\nShe married Herbert Berghof in 1957 and played opposite him in the New York City Center production of TOVARICH. Through the 50s and 60s, they toured together in THE LADY’S NOT FOR BURNING, THE AFFAIRS OF ANATOL, and CYPRIENNE (DIVORÇONS) by Sardou. She was famous for originating the role of Martha in the 1962 Broadway premiere of WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, in which she earned her second Tony Award and won the London Critics Award for her role in the English production.\n\nThroughout her career, Hagen made several television appearances, including PLAYHOUSE 90, KRAFT THEATRE PLAY OF THE WEEK, CBS specials, guest appearances on THE LONG HOT SUMMER, LOU GRANT, THE TWILIGHT ZONE, and THE HOME on PBS’s AMERICAN PLAYHOUSE. She received Daytime Emmy Award nominations for her television appearances in ONE LIFE TO LIVE (1986) and ABC AFTERSCHOOL SPECIALS – SEASONAL DIFFERENCES (1987). Hagen also appeared in the films REVERSAL OF FORTUNE (1990) and THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1978), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nUta Hagen was a transcendent actor, life-changing teacher, and blazingly honest advocate for the relevance and power of theater. Her integrity was legendary; she defiantly told truth to power and took personal and professional risks for the sake of great art. During the McCarthy era, Hagen was put on the Hollywood blacklist, and as a result, her film opportunities dwindled and she focused her career on teaching and New York theatre.\n\nHagen was one of the most renowned and respected acting teachers of the 20th century. She was highly sought-after and influential among those she trained at HB Studio, and quickly adopted the role of master teacher and studio co-lead, beside her partner in love and work, Herbert Berghof. During her time at the acting studio, she authored best-selling acting texts, the seminal RESPECT FOR ACTING and the definitive A CHALLENGE FOR THE ACTOR. Both texts still enjoy worldwide distribution among university students studying drama. Her most substantial contributions to theatre pedagogy were a series of “object exercises” that remain prominent training for acting professionals. In 2001, the documentary UTA HAGEN’S ACTING CLASS features Hagen in a series of master classes on her exercises.\n\nNotable actors that studied under Uta Hagen include Katie Finneran, Liza Minnelli, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Debbie Allen, F. Murray Abraham, Rita Gardner, Steve McQueen, Amanda Peet, Marlo Thomas, Jerry Stiller, Charles Nelson Reilly, and Hal Holbrook, among many others.\n\nAfter the death of her husband in 1990, Hagen concentrated on reorganizing HB Studio and The HB Playwrights Foundation, and continued to appear in many of the Foundation’s productions. She played the title role in Nicholas Wright’s MRS. KLEIN, a production that won great critical acclaim during its 1996-1997 run and later toured with major appearances. For her work in MRS. KLEIN, Hagen won the Obie Award.\n\nDuring 1981-1983, Hagen was inducted into The Theater Hall of Fame and the Wisconsin Theater Hall of Fame. She received honorary doctorates from Smith College, DePaul University, and Wooster College. In July 1986, Hagen was awarded the Mayor’s Liberty Medal along with The John Houseman Award and The Campostella Award for distinguished service in 1987.\n\nAmong Hagen’s numerous awards was her third Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1999. In March 2003, Hagen was awarded the National Medal of Honor for the Arts. She was honored, along with the other recipients, in a gala ceremony at the White House.\n\nUta Hagen left a remarkable and lasting legacy on the field of theatre and the dramatic arts when she passed on January 14, 2004. She is survived by her daughter, Leticia Ferrer, who continues work at her mother’s theatrical home, HB Studio, and granddaughter Teresa Teuscher and great-granddaughter Thyra Bielfeldt.The Uta Hagen Institute at HB Studio NYC Acting Studio: Uta Hagen was one of the foremost acting teachers of the 20th century.

Se integra dentro de la comarca de la Sierra de Francia. Pertenece al partido judicial de Ciudad Rodrigo y a la Mancomunidad Las Dehesas.[2]​\n\nSu término municipal está formado por las localidades de Nava de Francia y El Casarito, ocupa una superficie total de 16,51 km² y según los datos demográficos recogidos en el padrón municipal elaborado por el INE en el año 2017, cuenta con una población de 140 habitantes.\n\nEl pueblo tiene sus orígenes en asentamientos prehistóricos. Así, recientemente se ha descubierto el dolmen de La Morisca. En la parte más alta del cerro se ha localizado un túmulo circular de diez metros de diámetro y cincuenta centímetros de altura, que bien pudiera ser un sepulcro megalítico. Por su parte, Santoja alude al lugar denominado \"Casa del Tío Nava\" apuntado por César Morán Bardón como un megalito.\n\nEl origen de la Nava de Francia hay que buscarlo durante la campaña repobladora de Alfonso VI de León y su yerno el conde Raimundo de Borgoña, nacido socialmente en la primera década del siglo XII. Poco después, el municipio fue puesto bajo la jurisdicción de la Villa de Miranda del Castañar por la autoridad del rey Alfonso IX de León, y este mismo rey, siguiendo la tradición de sus antecesores en el reino como benefactores de los monjes al monasterio cisterciense de San Pedro de la Espina, en tierras de Valladolid. El documento firmado por el rey en Ciudad Rodrigo el 19 de noviembre de 1213, está redactado en el bajo latín vulgar que se hablaba en los reinos españoles por aquella época. Bien porque hubiera problemas entre Miranda y la abadía de San Pedro, bien porque a Miranda le interesase tener dominio pleno sobre todo el término de Nava, como lo tenía desde 1215 sobre El Cabaco y El Casarito, o bien porque al monasterio vallisoletano no le interesase conservar esta lejana hacienda, el caso es que 43 años después existe un documento por el cual se deduce el cambio de propiedad. Se trata del acto de una reunión celebrada en Tordesillas el 13 de octubre de 1296, a la que asistieron, de una parte, don Abril, Abad de la Espina, y algunos monjes, y de la otra dos vecinos de Miranda, para buscar una solución a un contencioso que sobre la Nava se había planteado desde hacía algún tiempo.\n\nDe este documento se puede deducirse que Miranda se había apoderado de la Nava, que el abad había protestado y presentado la credencial de los derechos de propiedad, y para resolver este conflicto se acordó que el monasterio renunciase definitivamente a la propiedad de este lugar, previo pago, por parte de la villa mirandeña, de 200 maravedíes; pequeña cantidad que puede explicarse si anteriormente Miranda hubiera comprado parcela tras parcela, o que ya hubiera comprado el término entero y sólo restaran de pagar los 200 maravedíes, siendo la reunión el trámite formal de la venta ya negociada.\n\nCon la creación de las actuales provincias en 1833, Nava de Francia fue incluido en la provincia de Salamanca, dentro de la Región Leonesa,[3]​ adscripción territorial que se ha mantenido vigente hasta la actualidad.\n\nNava (\"tierra sin árboles y llana, a veces pantanosa, situada generalmente entre montañas\"), a la que el topónimo alude, en la parte nororiental de la montaña sagrada de los serranos; la Peña de Francia, que se divisa desde todos los rincones de la localidad. Pero a pesar de enclavarse en la comarca de la Sierra de Francia, no comparte las características que define esta zona, ni en su arquitectura, ni en sus tradiciones, ni en su lenguaje.\n\nCuenta con una población de 120 habitantes (INE 2024).\n\nSegún el Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Nava de Francia tenía, a 31 de diciembre de 2018, una población total de 131 habitantes, de los cuales 72 eran hombres y 59 mujeres. De esa cifra, la mayor parte corresponde a la localidad cabecera del municipio, en el anejo de El Casarito se censan 20 habitantes. Respecto al año 2000, el censo refleja 150 habitantes, de los cuales 78 eran hombres y 72 mujeres. Por lo tanto, la pérdida de población en el conjunto del municipio para el periodo 2000-2018 ha sido de 19 habitantes, un 13% de descenso.\n\nEl escudo heráldico que representa al municipio fue aprobado con el siguiente blasón:\n\nEl alcalde de Nava de Francia no recibe ningún tipo de prestación económica por su trabajo al frente del ayuntamiento (2017).[7]​\n\nGran tradición festiva sus habitantes. Llama la atención el festejo de San Silvestre o \"El perrero\". Hasta hace no muchos años, Nava de Francia celebraba también los Reyes Magos, Las Candelas, San Blas (antiguamente había una ermita dedicada a este Santo), Santa Águeda, los Carnavales, Semana Santa y Pascua de Resurrección, el Sagrado Corazón o la Virgen del Rosario; pero la falta de gente ha hecho que las fiestas del pueblo se concentren el 18 de agosto, cuando todos los hijos del pueblo disfrutan del buen tiempo, de las verbenas, y si hay dinero, de la lidia de una vaquilla y posterior merienda con la carne del animal.\n\nNo era su fecha inicial pero la falta de gente ha hecho que las fiestas del pueblo se concentren el 18 de agosto, cuando todos los hijos del pueblo disfrutan de las vacaciones, del buen tiempo y de las verbenas. Hace años se lidiaba una vaquilla y en los días posteriores se merendaba con la carne del animal. Actualmente esa merienda se sigue realizando, el último día de las Fiestas y se ha sustituido por una paella y otros productos para todo los habitantes del pueblo e invitados.\n\nIntervienen varios personajes elegidos por el ayuntamiento entre los vecinos del municipio: mayordomos, el perrero, los alguaciles, los campaneros y los monaguillos. Durante la noche de la víspera, el perrero, los alguaciles y todo el acompañamiento que llevan recorren el pueblo, con el tamboril y los cohetes, a la vez que voltean las campanas y van a cantar la alborada ante las puertas de las casas de los mayordomos, quienes luego invitan a todo el grupo que ha intervenido en el canto a una copita de aguardiente y a unos dulces. Por la mañana, antes de la misa, el perrero, escoltado por los dos alguaciles, recorren todo el pueblo, y con el sonido de gaita y tamboril, van de casa en casa, donde son invitados a licor y dulces y cada vecino les da dinero. Durante este recorrido el perrero va con un látigo y corre tras las mozas, los niños y los muchachos. A las doce se celebra la misa, durante la que tiene lugar el ofertorio del perrero, que lleva una vela encendida y deposita lo recaudado en el peditorio de la mañana por todo el pueblo. Del perrero llama la atención su indumentaria, con una camisola que llega hasta los pies, un collar con bogayas de roble y una cencerra en su pie. Su significado puede ser similar al que otorga Julio Caro Baroja al zangarrón de Montamarta (Zamora) \"un personaje de cierta importancia que debe asegurar la fertilidad de los campos, y las azotainas que ejecuta son con suma probabilidad fertilizantes asimismo\".\n\nFiesta, que data del siglo XIII. Todo se debe a la importante ayuda de las mujeres en la reconquista del Alcázar en tiempo de los musulmanes: las jóvenes de la población de Zamarramala salieron a bailar al son de la dulzaina y el tamboril vestidas con los trajes de fiesta; los sarracenos, sorprendidos de tal acontecimiento, salieron del Alcázar para verlas de cerca y descuidaron la defensa de la fortaleza, lo que aprovecharon los hombres para entrar y hacerse con el mando del Alcázar. Y, desde 1227, como premio a la colaboración, les concedieron a las mujeres ostentar el mando durante todo un día al año, el día de Santa Águeda.\n• Wikimedia Commons alberga una categoría multimedia sobre Nava de Francia.\n• Índice de municipios de la Diputación de Salamanca Archivado el 23 de abril de 2009 en Wayback Machine.Nava de Francia – Ayuntamiento de Nava de Francia: Ya tenemos el Cartel de las Fiestas del Santo Cristo 2024, este es el Programa: Desde el Ayuntamiento de Nava…Nava de Francia - Wikipedia: Nava de Francia is a municipality in the province of Salamanca, autonomous community of Castile and León, Spain.

Su capital es Mitilene. Junto a algunas islas menores, constituye la unidad periférica de Lesbos, siendo su isla homónima la más grande e importante del archipiélago.\n\nEs famosa por ser la patria de Safo, la poetisa de la antigüedad cuyos poemas describían su amor apasionado hacia sus compañeras y que dio origen al moderno término lesbianismo. Por otra parte, el gentilicio en español de los isleños es lesbio y lesbia.\n\nEs la tercera isla más grande de Grecia,[2]​ y la octava del Mediterráneo,[3]​ con una superficie de 1630 km² y 320 km perimetrales de costa. La población se acerca a los cien mil habitantes, de los que más de un tercio viven en la capital Mitilene. Aparte de la capital, las ciudades principales son Kalloni, Gera, Plomari, Ayassos, Ereso, y Molivos (antigua Metimna). Plomari y Molivos son centros turísticos junto con Ereso, muy visitada por ser el lugar de nacimiento de la poetisa Safo.\n\nIsla montañosa, coronada por el monte Lepetymos, de 968 m, y el Olimpos de altura similar, que dominan el norte y el centro de la isla. A vista de satélite, se describe como una isla triangular, con dos bahías, la de Kalloni en posición central y la de Gera al sureste.\n\nSu origen volcánico se manifiesta en muchas partes. Los olivos cubren el 40 % de la isla, con un total de once millones de unidades, junto con otros árboles frutales. Los bosques ocupan el 20 % y el resto es tierra de cultivo y suelo urbano. Al oeste de la isla se encuentra un extenso bosque petrificado. El origen del bosque fue la cubrición de la vegetación existente entonces por materiales volcánicos hace veinte millones de años.[4]​\n\nSu economía se basa en la agricultura. El turismo en Mitilene, gracias a su aeropuerto internacional, y las playas de Plomari, Molyvos y Ereso contribuyen de manera sustancial a la riqueza de su economía.\n\nLa isla se menciona como Lazpa en las inscripciones hititas.[5]​ Homero, en la Ilíada, menciona a Mácar, un rey de la isla.[6]​\n\nMitilene, nombre dado a menudo a toda la isla, fue fundada en el siglo XI a. C. supuestamente por los pentílidas llegados de Tesalia, que gobernaron la isla hasta que fueron derrocados por una revuelta popular al comienzo del siglo VI a. C.\n\nOtras cinco ciudades tuvieron reyes, que también fueron progresivamente expulsados en los siglos VII y VI a. C. y se establecieron gobiernos oligárquicos o tiranías. Todas las ciudades fueron colonizadas por tesalios con los que se impuso la colonización eólica. La poetisa Safo aún escribía en el dialecto eólico del griego. Las ciudades de la isla eran tributarias del rey Creso de Lidia por sus posesiones en la costa (Creso no dominó nunca la isla), pero cuando este fue derrotado por los persas en 546 a. C., la isla pasó a dominio persa y hubo de pactar el pago de un tributo y el envío de soldados cuando el rey lo pidiese.\n\nEn el siglo V a. C., la ciudad de Arisba fue destruida por Metimna y el número de ciudades independientes se redujo a cinco: Mitilene, Metimna, Antisa, Ereso y Pirra. La isla de Lesbos no constituía un Estado-ciudad ni tampoco una federación, aunque algunas ciudades de la misma, como Antisa, Pirra, Ereso y Arisba, gravitaban políticamente en la órbita de Mitilene, que era la más importante de la isla y estaba gobernada por un sistema oligárquico, mientras que Metimna lo era por uno democrático.\n\nLas cinco ciudades contribuyeron a fundar Naucratis en Egipto y se aliaron con Mileto contra el tirano Polícrates de Samos, que les derrotó. Permanecieron tributarias del rey de Persia hasta 499 a. C., cuando el tirano Coes de Axandros, favorable a Persia, fue derrocado y la isla se unió a la revuelta jonia, pronto sofocada (494 a. C.). La victoria ateniense en Salamina en 480 a. C. supuso el fin del dominio persa en Lesbos. La isla tuvo siempre tendencia oligárquica, pero se acabaron imponiendo elementos partidarios de la democracia. Las cinco ciudades bajo la hegemonía de Mitilene (477 a. C.) ingresaron y se mantuvieron en la confederación de Delos (471 a. C.), excepto por una breve revuelta en la que Metimna no tomó parte: las demás ciudades fueran castigadas y sus tierras se repartieron entre ciudadanos atenienses.\n\nPermanecieron así hasta el final de la guerra del Peloponeso, cuando cayeron en manos de Esparta (405 a. C.) y de la oligarquía local aliada a Esparta. En 392 a. C. Atenas reconquistó las cinco ciudades, pero por la paz de Antálcidas se restableció su independencia en 387 a. C. En 369 a. C. ingresó en la segunda liga ateniense, pero cayó bajo dominio persa en 357 a. C.\n\nCuando Alejandro Magno ganó la batalla de Gránico, las ciudades se declararon a su favor, pero fueron sometidas por la flota persa dirigida por Memnón de Rodas. El general macedonio Hegéloco conquistó la isla hacia el 331 a. C., tras la muerte de Memnón, y pasó a ser gobernada por Macedonia hasta el 167 a. C. en que hubo de firmar un tratado con los romanos. En esta guerra, Labeus destruyó Antisa por ayudar a los macedonios, e incorporó a sus habitantes a los de Metimna.\n\nEn 89 a. C. las ciudades de la isla se aliaron con Mitrídates VI Eupator, rey del Ponto, provocando que los romanos desembarcaran en 88 a. C. y se establecieran permanentemente, tras destruir Mitilene, acusada de encabezar la alianza póntica. La última ciudad leal a Mitrídates fue conquistada por M. Minucius Thermus. En esta batalla se distinguió Julio César, que recibió una corona por salvar a un soldado.\n\nCneo Pompeyo Magno, a petición de Teófanes, le reconoció pocos años después cierta autonomía como ciudad libre bajo dominio romano (79 a. C.). La mujer y el hijo de Pompeyo estuvieron en Mitilene hasta el final de la campaña que acabó en la batalla de Farsalia. En esta época, Mitilene fue de hecho la capital de la provincia romana de Asia. En el año 70, el emperador Vespasiano le suprimió los privilegios, pero en el 117 Adriano se los restauró. La ciudad emitió moneda bajo diversos emperadores. Con la división provincial de Constantino I el Grande, la isla fue incluida en la Provincia Insularum (Hierocles p. 686).\n\nDurante la época cristiana se construyeron numerosas iglesias y basílicas (más de 50). En 769 fue saqueada por los eslavos, en 821, 881 y 1055 por los sarracenos, por los venecianos en 1125 y por el Reino de Aragón en el siglo XIII. En el 801 fue el lugar de exilio de la emperatriz bizantina Irene, que murió allí el 15 de agosto de 802. Hacia el 1090, Tzashas, emir de Esmirna, conquistó Mitilene, pero fracasó ante Metimna. Alejo I Comneno envió una expedición que recuperó Mitilene. En 1204 fue parte de los dominios directos del emperador latino y en el 1224 fue ocupada por el emperador de Nicea. A partir del 1270 se concedió privilegios comerciales a los genoveses, pero se mantuvo la soberanía bizantina. Los genoveses la quisieron ocupar en 1346, pero el ataque imperial a Quíos lo impidió. Poco después Francesco Gattilusio, un patricio genovés, puso al servicio del bizantino Juan V Paleólogo naves y hombres para ayudarlo a recuperar el trono del que había sido desposeído (1354). A cambio, recibió la señoría de Lesbos y la mano de su hermana María (17 de julio de 1355), si bien, hay que decir que los Gattilusio fueron aliados fieles del imperio y aceptaron la cultura bizantina.\n\nEl 25 de diciembre de 1455, los otomanos atacaron la isla y la ocuparon, excepto Metimna. Se retiraron en el 1456, a cambio de la cesión de Tasos (otra isla de los Gattilusio) y el aumento del tributo. En 1462, acusaron al señor local Nicolo II Gattiluso de deponer y matar a su hermano Domenicco I Gattiluso, tributario de los turcos. Mitilene fue destruida y después de quince días de resistencia Nicolo se rindió y fue trasladado a Constantinopla junto a otros miembros de la familia.\n\nEntre los siglos XVI a XIX, la isla permanecería bajo dominio turco, siendo el lugar de nacimiento del famoso pirata Barbarroja. Durante la guerra de los Balcanes de 1912, después de la batalla naval de Elli, la recuperaron los griegos. Desde entonces permanece bajo su soberanía.\n\nA partir de los conflictos en Oriente Medio iniciados en 2014, especialmente por la Guerra Civil Siria y la Guerra contra Estado Islámico, pero sin limitarse a estos, cientos de miles de personas han huido de sus territorios originarios hacia Europa. Una de las puertas de acceso al continente ha sido la isla de Lesbos, dada su proximidad con Turquía, desde donde han cruzado el mar Egeo en lanchas y botes proporcionadas a menudo por traficantes, muchas veces pereciendo en el trayecto.[7]​ La situación ha sido atendida por distintas organizaciones humanitarias internacionales[8]​ que han denunciado el poco interés de los gobiernos por auxiliar a los inmigrantes,[9]​ especialmente después de los acuerdos de deportación firmados entre Turquía y la Unión Europea.[10]​\n• Alceo, (h. 640-600 a. C.), poeta, y su hermano Antiménidas\n• Pítaco, uno de los siete sabios de Grecia\n• Cratipo de Pérgamo, filósofo que enseñó en Mitilene\n\nEn el siglo XX el premio nobel de literatura Odysseas Elytis, descendiente de una familia de la isla, vivió en Lesbos."}

It is Real Madrid's reserve team. They play their home games at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium with a capacity of 6,000 seats.[2]\n\nReserve teams in Spain play in the same league system as their senior team rather than a separate league. Reserve teams, however, cannot play in the same division as their senior team. Therefore, Real Madrid Castilla are ineligible for promotion to the La Liga as long as Real Madrid plays there. Consequently, they must play at least one level below their main side and they are not eligible to play in the Copa del Rey. In addition, only under-23 players, or under-25 players with a professional contract, can switch between senior and reserve teams.\n\nIn 1948, Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, a local amateur team, then playing in the Tercera División, agreed to become a feeder club for Real Madrid. Originally formed in 1930, the team took its name from the national motto of Spain. Real gave AD Plus Ultra financial support and in return were given first refusal on the club's best players. By 1949, they made their debut in the Segunda División and in 1952, the club became the official Real reserve team. In 1959, they reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Generalísimo, losing 7–2 on aggregate to eventual runners-up Granada.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, future senior Real Madrid players and Spanish internationals such as José María Zárraga, Enrique Mateos, Ramón Marsal, Pedro Casado, Juan Manuel Villa, José María Vidal, Fernando Serena and Ramón Grosso all spent time at the club, and Juan Alonso finished off his career there. The singer Julio Iglesias played as a goalkeeper for the club in the early 1960s until injury ended his football career.[3] Miguel Muñoz began his coaching career at the club. In 1972, Plus Ultra folded because of the demise of the insurance company of the same name, and their position in the Tercera División was taken by Castilla Club de Fútbol, the new reserve team for Real Madrid, on 21 July.\n\nAs Castilla CF, the team enjoyed something of a golden age. During this era, with a team that included Agustín, Ricardo Gallego and Francisco Pineda, Castilla reached the final of the 1979–80 Copa del Rey. During their cup run, they beat four Primera División teams, including Hércules, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Sporting de Gijón.[4] The latter two eventually finished second and third in the Primera División. In the final, they played Real Madrid but lost 6–1. Because Real also won the Primera División, however, Castilla qualified for the 1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup. Despite beating West Ham United 3–1 in the opening game at the Santiago Bernabéu, they lost the return 5–1 after extra time and went out in the first round.[4] Castilla reached the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey on three further occasions, in 1984, 1986, and 1988.\n\nIn 1984, with Amancio Amaro as coach, Castilla won the Segunda División. Amaro's tenure as coach saw the rise of the famous La Quinta del Buitre – Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel, and Miguel Pardeza. Castilla were ineligible for promotion, however, because Real Madrid were already in the Primera División. In the 1987–88 season, they finished third in the Segunda División, but were once again ineligible for promotion.\n\nIn 1991, the Royal Spanish Football Federation banned the use of separate names for reserve teams and Castilla CF became known as Real Madrid Deportiva and then Real Madrid B. In the early 1990s, two former Castilla players, Vicente del Bosque and Rafael Benítez, began their coaching careers with the team. In 1997, the team was relegated to the Segunda División B, but despite this, they continued to produce internationally acclaimed players. These have included Raúl, Guti and Iker Casillas, who all became established members of the senior Real Madrid team.\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, coach Juan Ramón López Caro guided the team back to the Segunda División and the team subsequently revived the El Castilla name and became known as Real Madrid Castilla. In 2006, the new stadium of the club's training facilities Ciudad Real Madrid was named the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium and Francisco Moreno Cariñena became the first independent chairman in 16 years. In this year, the team also has continued to produce quality players such as Roberto Soldado and Álvaro Arbeloa.\n\nIn the 2006–2007 season, the team was relegated to the Segunda División B under the management of ex-Real Madrid legend Míchel after occupying 19th place in the league in a disappointing season. Míchel received a lot of criticism and accepted all the blame for the team's bad performances, especially for those who had a wonderful season in the 2005–06 season, such as Rubén de la Red, Esteban Granero and Javi García. The reserves produced other quality players, including Juan Mata and Álvaro Negredo.\n\nReal Madrid Castilla was promoted back to the Segunda División at the end of the 2011–12 season after beating Cádiz in the play-offs with an aggregate of score 8–1 and this year the club produced one quality player, Dani Carvajal who was sold to Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 before he returned to Real Madrid in 2013 to play in the first team.\n\nIn the 2013–14 season, three quality players Nacho, Álvaro Morata and Jesé were promoted to the first team, and then Castilla was relegated in the last matchday after being defeated by Real Murcia in the last match of the season.\n\nSince 2014 when they played in the third division, Castilla continued to produce other quality players, including Lucas Vázquez, Fernando Pacheco, Borja Mayoral, Marcos Llorente, Sergio Reguilón, Óscar Rodríguez, Achraf Hakimi and Fran García.\n\nAfter the resumption of competitions in the 2020–21 season, the team finished runner-up in their group and qualified to play in the promotion system to the new categories of Spanish football after a restructuring of the same by the RFEF for the 2021–22 season.[5] In the promotion playoffs, the team finished third, which secured their place in the Primera Federación. They also had the chance to move up to the Segunda División, but they were eliminated in the semifinals by Ibiza.[6] The team was thus one of those that premiered the new Primera Federación, being placed in Group II. In 2022–23 season, Castilla placed in Group I and finished in third place, they have chance promotion to Segunda División, but they were eliminated in the final play off by Eldense. In the 2023–24 season, still under the direction of Raúl González, they finished in tenth position.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

The inaugural match was between Real Madrid and Stade de Reims, a rematch of the European Cup final won by Real Madrid in 1956. Real Madrid won the inaugural match 6–1 with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2), and José Manuel Jurado.[10]\n\nThe venue is part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's new training facilities located outside Madrid in Valdebebas, near Madrid–Barajas Airport.\n\nThe capacity of the main stand at the west is 4,000 seats, with additional 2,000 seats at the eastern stand, giving the stadium a total capacity of 6,000 seats. It is envisaged to increase the seating capacity up to 25,000 at the completion of the expansion.\n\nNote: This list includes players that have appeared in at least 100 top league games and/or have reached international status.\n• Real Madrid Castilla News, Photos and Videos.

Fue adscrito como club filial oficial el 21 de julio de 1972 bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol,[1]​ aunque existía desde 1947 con la antigua denominación de Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra bajo la que ya realizaba las funciones de filial. ​[3]​ En ocasiones se le suele referir erróneamente por su antiguo apelativo de Real Madrid \"B\", debido al carácter de «segundo equipo» de la entidad, y denominación habitual en los equipos filiales de España.[4]​\n\nEs el primer equipo que conforma las categorías inferiores del club, denominadas como «La Fábrica», siendo considerada como una de las mejores canteras futbolísticas de Europa.[5]​ El diario francés L'Équipe así lo reflejó en un estudio realizado en 2014 donde resaltaba que 34 futbolistas profesionales que actualmente militan en alguna de las grandes cinco Ligas de Europa fueron formados en las instalaciones madrileñas, perteneciendo ocho de ellos al actual primer equipo del club.[6]​[n 2]​ A fecha de 2021 son más de un centenar de futbolistas profesionales los formados en «La Fábrica» los que compiten en Europa,[7]​ y el Centro Internacional para Estudios Deportivos (en inglés: International Centre for Sports Studies - CIES) la señala como la academia que produce más jugadores de primer nivel en Europa desde 2016.[8]​[n 3]​[9]​\n\nEl filial milita desde 2021 en la Primera Federación, tercera categoría del fútbol español en sustitución de la extinta Segunda División \"B\". A diferencia de otras Ligas europeas y mundiales de fútbol, en España la regulación y normativas que afecta a los equipos filiales permiten que estos puedan actuar como clubes profesionales a todos los efectos —pudiendo competir en el mismo sistema de Liga que el resto de equipos—, en vez de jugar una Liga separada de equipos filiales. El Castilla no puede ascender a una categoría superior o igual del fútbol español a la del primer equipo, siendo esta la Primera División.[10]​\n\nPese a que históricamente siempre actuó como un club de fútbol más dentro de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF) —y por lo tanto con los mismos derechos que cualquier otro— en cuanto a las competiciones a disputar,[n 4]​ en el año 1991 la Federación llevó a efecto un cambio en sus estatutos que afectó directamente a dichos equipos \"B\" o filiales. Desde ese momento se impidió la participación de estos equipos en la Copa del Rey,[11]​ —circunstancia aún vigente en la actualidad—, y que ha dejado al equipo madridista como único filial de España y primero del mundo en disputar la final del torneo de Copa doméstica,[n 5]​ en la que curiosamente se enfrentó a su primer equipo, el Real Madrid C. F.\n\nEntre sus logros deportivos destaca un campeonato de la Segunda División en la temporada 1983-84,[1]​ siendo el único filial español en conseguirlo, y el mencionado subcampeonato en la Copa del Rey de 1979-80 que perdió frente a su equipo matriz por 6-1.[1]​ Este logró vino con el honor de ser el primer equipo de inferior categoría que conseguía eliminar a cuatro equipos de la Primera División,[12]​,[n 6]​ otorgándole además el derecho a disputar la Recopa de Europa de la temporada 1980-81 al estar ya clasificado el primer equipo para disputar la Copa de Europa,[n 7]​ convirtiéndose en el único equipo filial en la historia del fútbol en Europa en disputar una competición en dicho continente.[n 8]​ Es además el mejor club filial por resultados deportivos de España.[13]​\n\nEl Castilla disputa sus partidos como local en el estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano localizado en la Ciudad Real Madrid,[14]​ —complejo deportivo del club situado en Valdebebas y comúnmente denominado como Ciudad Deportiva en referencia a las antiguas instalaciones—, construido en honor al presidente de honor del club D. Alfredo Di Stéfano Laulhé con una capacidad de 6500 espectadores.[15]​\n\nPese a que el equipo filial madridista es fundado oficialmente en 1972 como un club absolutamente dependiente del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol, ya durante la temporada 1931-32 aparece un Castilla F. C. formado por jugadores del Racing de Madrid, el desaparecido Sporting de Madrid y algunos antiguos jugadores madridistas donde se fogueaba a futuras promesas hasta que finalmente desaparece en 1933. ​\n\nParalelamente, el 16 de diciembre de 1930 los empleados de la compañía de seguros Plus Ultra fundan la sociedad polideportiva Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, con una masa social de 800 personas y secciones de baloncesto, rugby o remo entre otras.[16]​ El club también actuaba y hacía las funciones de equipo filial del club madridista junto a otras entidades como el Club Deportivo Pardiñas, la Sociedad Primitiva Amistad, la Sociedad Recreativa El Cafeto, la Sociedad Stadium Foot-ball Club, el Club Patria Balompié, el Imperio Foot-ball Club o la Sociedad Deportiva Leganés, sociedades dispuestas a suministrarle jugadores al club de Chamartín a cambio de diferentes ayudas para su progresión y subsistencia en algunos casos. ​ ​ A ellos se unieron después de la Guerra Civil otros como la Agrupación Deportiva Ferroviaria, o el Club Deportivo Mediodía como equipos ayudados por los madridistas en su devenir deportivo. ​[1]​\n\nOriginalmente el Real Madrid C. F. mantenía diversos acuerdos con varios clubes madrileños que le hacían las veces de cantera, de donde nutrirse de jugadores que le resultaran interesantes para su primer equipo, recibiendo material deportivo y ayudas económicas a cambio. Uno de esos equipos era la citada Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra y que en 1946 se fusiona con el Club Deportivo Cifesa con motivo del ascenso a la Tercera División y antes del ascenso a la Segunda División en apenas dos temporadas.[19]​ Uno año después estableció finalmente un acuerdo formal con el Real Madrid C. F. por el que pasó a convertirse en su club filial a cambio de las citadas ayudas prevaleciendo por encima del resto de clubes.\n\nDisputaba sus partidos tanto en su propio estadio, el Velódromo de Ciudad Lineal, como en el Estadio de Chamartín, recinto del primer equipo madridista,[16]​ y estuvo cerca del ascenso a la Primera División en la temporada 1959-60. Del club aparecen grandes figuras como José María Zárraga, Enrique Mateos, Ramón Grosso, o Miguel Muñoz, y el club se convierte en un equipo inestable tras subir y bajar de categoría en numerosas ocasiones. Tras muchos esfuerzos para retornar a la Segunda División y tras perder varias fases de ascenso en las temporadas 1963-64, 1965-66, 1966-67, y 1967-68, entró en dificultades financieras a comienzos de los años setenta, momento en el que cedió los derechos federativos de forma oficial y permanente al club madridista en 1972, y pasar a ser un club con dependencia total de los blancos.[1]​\n\nEl 21 de julio de 1972, al finalizar la temporada 1971-72, la A. D. Plus Ultra se disuelve por los malos resultados y es entonces cuando el Real Madrid, de mano de su presidente Santiago Bernabéu, adquiere los derechos deportivos y federativos del que a partir de entonces fue de manera oficial el nuevo filial madridista bajo el nombre de Castilla Club de Fútbol, en honor de la región histórica de Castilla.[20]​\n\nAl año siguiente comenzó su andadura en la Tercera División donde se mantuvo hasta su ingreso en 1977 en la recién estrenada Segunda División \"B\" como tercera categoría del fútbol español. En ella se proclama subcampeón en el año de su estreno y así, en 1978, asciende finalmente a la Segunda División.[20]​\n\nEn la temporada 1979-80 fue subcampeón de la Copa del Rey disputando una histórica final contra el primer equipo del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Esta hazaña no ha sido igualada nunca, poseyendo el honor de ser el único equipo filial que haya disputado una final en la historia de la Copa pese a que perdería por 6-1. En las eliminatorias, el Castilla se deshizo del Extremadura, el AD Alcorcón, el Racing de Santander y a los entonces equipos de primera división, Hércules CF (tras levantar el 4-1 de la ida con un 4-0 en Madrid), el Athletic Club (al vencer en la vuelta en San Mamés por 1-2 y el empate sin goles en la capital), y a la Real Sociedad (con un resultado global de 3-2), que ese año terminaría siendo subcampeón de liga y la ganaría los dos años siguientes. En semifinales se enfrentó al Sporting de Gijón de Quini, tras vencer por 4-1 en el partido de vuelta, remontando un 2-0 de la ida.[1]​\n\nPor tal motivo, participó en la Recopa de Europa del siguiente año donde caería en la primera ronda frente al West Ham United, venciendo en el Santiago Bernabéu por 3-1, pero cayendo derrotado por 5-1 en Londres tras una prórroga.\n\nFue el periodista Julio César Iglesias el primero en usar el apelativo, en un artículo publicado por el diario El País el 14 de noviembre de 1983 titulado «Amancio y la quinta del Buitre».[21]​[22]​ En él, Iglesias hablaba de un grupo de cinco futbolistas que por entonces destacaban en el Castilla Club de Fútbol —filial del Real Madrid C. F.—, y que esa temporada se proclamó campeón de la Segunda División de España siendo el primer y único filial de la historia en conseguirlo.\n\nEl hecho se produjo en la temporada 1983-84 bajo la dirección de Amancio Amaro tras superar en la última jornada al Athletic Club, el Bilbao Athletic de Julio Salinas y Genar Andrinua que entrenaba José Ángel Iribar. El equipo estaba formado por la mítica generación de «La Quinta de El Buitre» que iba alternando su actuación en el filial con apariciones en la primera plantilla.[1]​ La misma estuvo formada por Emilio Butragueño —líder deportivo de la generación—, Míchel González, Miguel Pardeza, Manolo Sanchís y Rafael Martín Vázquez.\n\nLa expectación por ver a los jóvenes futbolistas era tal que en ocasiones disputaba sus partidos en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu. Sus partidos llevaban casi tantos espectadores como los partidos del primer equipo, como los partidos de Copa del Rey o frente al citado Bilbao Athletic con quien mantenía una gran rivalidad y disputa, y que llegaban a reunir hasta a ochenta mil espectadores.[24]​ Sus resultados además se vieron secundados por grandes actuaciones en la Copa del Rey, competición que disputó hasta la prohibición de la Federación a equipos filiales, y en donde eliminó a varios equipos de Primera División en sus participaciones.\n\nSanchís y Martín Vázquez fueron los primeros en debutar en la primera plantilla en Primera División, dándoles la oportunidad el entonces técnico Alfredo Di Stéfano. Fue en Murcia, el 4 de diciembre de 1983. A pesar de sus 18 años, ambos tuvieron una actuación destacada, y Sanchís incluso marcó el gol de la victoria. Unos días después, el 31 de diciembre de 1983, Pardeza disputó siete minutos con el primer equipo ante el Real Club Deportivo Español. El onubense —era el único integrante de la Quinta nacido fuera de Madrid— no tuvo la continuidad de Sanchís y Martín Vázquez, y completó la mayor parte de la temporada en el filial.[25]​\n\nApenas unos meses después, el 5 de febrero de 1984, debutó Emilio Butragueño en Cádiz. El Buitre saltó al terreno de juego cuando su equipo perdía 2-0 frente al Cádiz Club de Fútbol y revolucionó el partido con dos goles y una asistencia que culminaron la remontada madridista.[26]​\n\nMíchel fue el único que disputó toda la temporada 1983/84 en el Castilla C. F. y no le llegó la oportunidad de debutar en el primer equipo hasta el 2 de septiembre de 1984, coincidiendo con la primera jornada de la siguiente temporada.\n\nMientras Butragueño, Sanchís, Martín Vázquez y Míchel se consolidaron en el primer equipo, Pardeza militó en el Castilla durante toda la temporada 1984/85 y la 1985/86 fue cedido al Real Zaragoza. Un año después volvió a la disciplina madridista, pero en 1987 se desvinculó definitivamente del club blanco para regresar a Zaragoza.\n\nLos otros cuatro integrantes de la Quinta del Buitre convirtieron al club en uno de los mejores equipos de España y Europa durante la segunda mitad de los años 1980. Conquistaron, entre otros títulos, cinco campeonatos de Liga consecutivos (1985 a 1990), siendo la segunda vez que lo conseguía y el único club en lograrlo en la historia de la competición, una Copa de la Liga (1985), tres Supercopas de España (1988-90) y dos Copas de la UEFA (1985 y 1986).\n\nEn 1990, tras una normativa de la Federación Española que afectaba los equipos filiales, debe disolverse. Así ocurre el 1 de julio y desaparece como club pasando a ser equipo dependiente y adoptando la denominación de Real Madrid Deportivo, perdiendo además del nombre, su escudo original, y los nuevos los adoptaría ambos del primer equipo. Durante esos primeros años empiezan en el club su carrera como entrenadores dos antiguos futbolistas que pasaron por sus filas: Vicente del Bosque y Rafa Benítez. Los siguientes años alternaría descensos y ascensos entre la segunda y la segunda división \"B\" ya bajo el nombre de Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"B\" debido a normas federativas.[20]​\n\nFue entonces cuando surgirían en el equipo otros grandes talentos como Ismael Urzaiz, Santiago Cañizares, José María Gutiérrez Guti o Álvaro Benito entre otros, además de Raúl González o Iker Casillas, aunque estos últimos apenas disputaron uno y cuatro partidos en el equipo filial y fueron promocionados prematuramente al primer equipo. Grandes generaciones dentro del equipo permitieron que el filial disputase 18 temporadas en la Segunda División compitiendo con primeros equipos históricos del fútbol español. Durante la temporada 2004-2005, el equipo ascendió a la Segunda División de España, tras derrotar en la fase de ascenso al Zaragoza \"B\" y al UB Conquense en unos partidos que disputó como local en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[27]​\n\nPor esta razón, en el verano de 2005 la Federación Española de Fútbol le concedió la petición de cambio de nombre al de Real Madrid Castilla C. F.. Sin embargo, no logra recuperar su antiguo escudo bajo la dirección del nuevo presidente Francisco Moreno Cariñena.[n 9]​ En la temporada 2005-06, disputó las dos primeras jornadas como local en el estadio Santiago Bernabéu para luego disputar el resto de la temporada en la Ciudad Deportiva de Valdebebas. Los últimas dos jornadas como local ya las pudo disputar en el recién inaugurado Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano. En la dicha temporada consiguió mantenerse pero en la temporada 2006-07 perdió la categoría al finalizar 19.º, pese a contar con una de las mejores generaciones de futbolistas que dio la cantera, con hombres como Juan Mata, Roberto Soldado o Álvaro Negredo. Desde entonces se mantuvo un lustro en la Segunda División \"B\", sin conseguir ascender a la Segunda División.[1]​\n\nEn la temporada 2010-11, ya bajo la presidencia de Nicolás Martín-Sanz, el equipo consigue acceder a la fase de ascenso a segunda división, pero cae derrotado frente al fuerte C. D. Alcoyano —que finalmente logró subir de categoría— por 0-2 en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu y tras empatar 2-2 en la vuelta en Alcoy.[20]​ Al año siguiente, queda campeón del Grupo I, lo que le permite jugar la eliminatoria directa por el ascenso contra el Cádiz CF. En el partido de ida, el Castilla vence por 0-3 a domicilio, lo que le dejó a priori un partido cómodo para la vuelta en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano, al no poder disputarse en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu por encontrarse en reformas.[28]​ En el partido de vuelta, el Castilla resuelve la eliminatoria con un 5-1 y logra el ascenso a Segunda División tras lograr un resultado global de 8-1.[29]​\n\n Posteriormente, y con el ascenso ya logrado, disputó contra el C. D. Mirandés la final para dilucidar el campeón de la Segunda División \"B\". En ella, jugada a doble partido, el Castilla derrotó al conjunto castellano-leonés por un global de 6-0, conquistando así su cuarto título de esta categoría. En aquel equipo militaron futbolistas como Jesé Rodríguez y Álvaro Morata —referentes del grupo— Dani Carvajal, Nacho Fernández, Denís Chéryshev o Lucas Vázquez entre otros, formando otra de las mejores generaciones dadas por el club.\n\nEn la nueva temporada, el Real Madrid Castilla sorprende tanto por su acierto goleador, como por su debilidad defensiva, dejando ver en sus encuentros un gran número de goles,[30]​ aunque con el paso de los partidos se fue notando su crecimiento en la nueva categoría, demostrando la gran diferencia de competitividad respecto al año anterior.[31]​ Al final del curso, batió su mejor registro goleador en la categoría, superando al Castilla de la «Quinta del Buitre» alcanzando un total de setenta y un goles,[n 10]​ dos más que los logrados en la citada campaña 1983-84 donde se proclamó campeón de la categoría.[32]​\n\nAl año siguiente, la salida de muchos de los citados futbolistas de la plantilla propició que se hubiese de reestructurar el equipo por completo lo que unido a una gran escasez goleadora —en contraposición con el curso anterior— acarreó un mal arranque liguero,[33]​ que a su vez desencadenó la destitución al frente del equipo de Alberto Toril,[34]​ entrenador del mismo desde enero de 2011.\n\nSu sucesor en el cargo, José Manuel Díaz —hasta la fecha entrenador del segundo filial, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"C\"—, trajo nuevos aires que dieron con una mejoría en el conjunto que le permitió abandonar el último lugar de la clasificación merced a cuatro victorias consecutivas encadenadas, algo que no lograba el filial en la categoría de plata desde la temporada 1988-89.[35]​ Sin embargo, una mala racha de resultados en la recta final del campeonato terminó provocando el descenso del Castilla en la última jornada del campeonato.\n\nPara afrontar el regreso a la Segunda División, el club confirmó al histórico exfutbolista francés Zinedine Zidane al frente de la plantilla,[36]​ además de llevar a cabo una reestructuración en las categorías inferiores que propició la desaparición del hasta entonces segundo filial, con el propósito de reunir únicamente en el Castilla a los mejores candidatos de ambos equipos que pudieran llegar a formar parte de la primera plantilla madridista en el futuro.[37]​[38]​\n\nTras no conseguir disputar la fase de ascenso al finalizar quintos de su grupo, se llevaron a cabo contrataciones de futbolistas con gran proyección como Carlos Abad, además de promocionar a jugadores como Borja Mayoral, Marcos Llorente o José Carlos Lazo entre otros. El equipo, del que se hizo cargo a mitad de temporada Luis Miguel Ramis debido a la promoción de Zidane al primer equipo,[39]​ realizó una buena campaña merced sobre todo al acierto goleador de Mariano Díaz, autor de 25 tantos que ayudaron al equipo se proclamase por quinta vez en su historia campeón de grupo de la división. Ello le valió para disputar la fase de ascenso en la que cayó derrotado en la ruta de los campeones frente al Universidad Católica de Murcia Club de Fútbol por un global de 4-3 en una eliminatoria llena de polémica por la excesiva dureza y permisividad de los árbitros en favor del equipo murciano,[40]​[41]​ llevándole a disputar la segunda fase de ascenso. En ella cayó en la primera eliminatoria frente al Club Lleida Esportiu tras un 0-4 global que le impidió subir a la segunda categoría del fútbol español.[42]​\n\nEl equipo no volvió a tener oportunidad de ascenso hasta la temporada 2018-19, dirigidos por Manolo Díaz, en la que nuevamente fue eliminado en el primer cruce por el Fútbol Club Cartagena. Una victoria por 3-1 en la ida fue revertida por los cartageneros al vencer en la vuelta por 2-0 y clasificarse merced al gol en campo rival en el empate técnico 3-3.[43]​ Para la nueva temporada fue contratado el exjugador y excanterano Raúl González como entrenador, hasta entonces dirigiendo al juvenil \"B\". La dificultad para planificar la plantilla con mayoría de jugadores procedentes del primer equipo juvenil a comienzo de temporada condicionó la temporada,[44]​ situándose en mitad de la tabla de clasificación al final de la primera vuelta.\n\nA mitad del curso —tras una mejora del equipo— las competiciones se cancelaron por parte de la UEFA, la RFEF y la La Liga,[45]​[46]​[47]​ debido a un brote del coronavirus tipo 2 del síndrome respiratorio agudo grave, una pandemia global vírica[48]​ que llegó a Europa desde Asia,[49]​[50]​ provocando contagios, fallecimientos y retroceso económico. Tras una mejoría después de meses de confinamiento de la población para frenar los contagios, el gobierno decretó que las competiciones profesionales pudieran retomar su actividad sin público en las gradas, no así las del resto de categorías, dándose por finalizadas tal cual se encontrasen en ese momento las clasificaciones.[51]​ Así, el equipo finalizó séptimo el campeonato.\n\nTras la reanudación de las competiciones en la temporada 2020-21, el equipo finalizó subcampeón de su grupo y se clasificó para disputar el sistema de ascenso a las nuevas categorías del fútbol español tras una reestructuración de las mismas por parte de la RFEF de cara al curso 2021-22.[52]​ En la disputa del ascenso finalizó como tercero con lo que aseguró su plaza en la Primera Federación —categoría que sustituyó a la Segunda División \"B\"— y tuvo opción de subir a la Segunda División de España, pero fue eliminado en las semifinales por la Unión Deportiva Ibiza.[53]​\n\nFue así uno de los equipos que estrenó la nueva Primera Federación, encuadrado en el grupo II y también en temporada 2023–24 , aún bajo dirección de Raúl González, donde finalizó en décima posición.\n\nEn sus inicios como A. D. Plus Ultra el club filial poseía su propio uniforme al igual que el escudo. Este constaba de camiseta azul, pantalones blancos y medias azules. Así continuó, salvo pequeñas modificaciones aunque siempre manteniendo sus colores, hasta la temporada 1972, fecha en la que se disuelve para pasar a ser oficialmente el filial del Real Madrid y tener total dependencia de él. En su primera temporada el Castilla mantiene el color azul en su equipación, pero en 1973 cambia sus colores por los de su equipo matriz, con todos sus complementos de color blanco, manteniéndose inalterable, y evolucionando al igual que el del primer equipo, hasta la actualidad.\n\nEn sus inicios como A. D. Plus Ultra poseyó un escudo propio hasta que se cambió en 1972 —fecha en la que pasó a tener total dependencia del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol— por uno propio a semejanza del club madridista.\n\nCon las iniciales de Castilla Club de Fútbol entrelazadas como en el escudo del Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, la sustitución de la \"M\" por la \"C\" del Castilla, con la banda morada atravesándolo, pero sin la corona real, y con la denominación del club alrededor de un fondo azul. A partir de 1990-91, tras la normativa de filiales de la Real Federación Española de Fútbol, el club pasa a usar el escudo del Real Madrid. Hubo un intento por recuperarlo en 2005 al igual que se recuperó el nombre, pero no se consiguió y el filial sigue usando el escudo del primer equipo.\n\nEl Real Madrid Castilla disputa sus encuentros como local en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano, situado en la Ciudad Real Madrid en Valdebebas. Fue inaugurado el 9 de mayo de 2006 y posee una capacidad de 6000 espectadores,[14]​ todos sentados, y unas dimensiones de 105 x 68 metros.[14]​ La capacidad del estadio se verá aumentada a los 25 000 espectadores cuando concluyan todas las fases de construcción previstas en la Ciudad Real Madrid.[54]​\n\nLa calefacción propia, con la que el recinto puede ser también utilizado si fuese conveniente como zona de entrenamiento del club y la cubierta movible del lateral son algunas de las más novedosas técnicas de que dispone el estadio, para favorecer tanto al club como a los medios informativos y los aficionados.[54]​\n\nEl estadio fue inaugurado con un encuentro entre el primer equipo, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol y el Stade de Reims, en honor a la final de la primera Copa de Europa, máxima competición de clubes europeos, que fue ganada por el equipo blanco por 6-1. El autor del primer gol fue Sergio Ramos en el minuto 14' tras un pase de Robinho.[55]​ Antes de dicho encuentro se jugó un partido que enfrentó al equipo de veteranos del club contra un combinado de veteranos de la selección española, que precedió al acto de presentación y homenaje al presidente de honor D. Alfredo Di Stéfano, emblemático jugador del club del que toma su nombre.[54]​\n\nUna estatua de bronce del citado exfutbolista preside el acceso al estadio, representando una de sus más conocidas estampas al celebrar un gol en las semifinales de la Copa de Europa de 1957-58 frente al Budapesti Vasas S. C. en el que anotó un triplete, en la que a la postre sería la tercera Copa de Europa consecutiva del club.[56]​\n\nAntiguamente y bajo la denominación de A. D. Plus Ultra disputaba sus partidos en el extinto Velódromo de Ciudad Lineal (renombrado Estadio Antonio Borrachero el 1 de abril de 1966), el antiguo campo donde el primer equipo del Real Madrid C. F. jugó como local en la temporada 1923-24. Fue adquirido en propiedad por el club en la temporada 1945-46 en su estreno en Tercera División.[20]​\n\nDesde la temporada 1972-73, fecha en la que el club es rebautizado y refundado oficialmente como filial madridista con el nombre de Castilla C. F., hasta la temporada 1991-92, el equipo disputó sus partidos como local en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu.[57]​ En la temporada 1992-93, el filial se movió a la antigua Ciudad Deportiva del Real Madrid.[58]​ Allí permaneció hasta agosto de 2004, cuando el equipo se trasladó de forma temporal a la Ciudad del Fútbol de Las Rozas para poder entrenar y jugar los partidos como local[59]​ mientras tenían lugar las obras de demolición de la antigua Ciudad Deportiva y construcción de la nueva. En octubre de 2005, se mudó definitivamente a Valdebebas, lugar de la actual Ciudad Deportiva del club: la Ciudad Real Madrid.[14]​\n\nPara la temporada 2020-21, dado que el primer equipo seguiría disputando sus encuentros como local en el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano debido a las obras de remodelación que el club está acometiendo en el Estadio Santiago Bernabéu y al hecho de que no se permitía el ingreso de público en los estadios de equipos profesionales en España por la pandemia de COVID-19, el Castilla pasó a jugar sus partidos en el campo 7 de la Ciudad Real Madrid.[60]​\n\nLa oficialmente denominada Ciudad Real Madrid es un complejo deportivo donde se encuentran las residencias de jugadores y los campos de entrenamiento de las distintas categorías de la sección de fútbol, además de las sedes de la radio y la televisión del club. Se encuentra situada en el Parque de Valdebebas, en el norte de Madrid, muy cercana al aeropuerto de Madrid-Barajas. Es inaugurada en el año 2005, en sustitución de la antigua Ciudad deportiva del Paseo de la Castellana, tras una recalificación de los terrenos en propiedad del club en una operación junto con el Ayuntamiento de Madrid.\n\nTiene una superficie de 1 200 000 metros cuadrados, de los que hasta el momento se han desarrollado unos 300 000. El complejo incluye además de las instalaciones médicas y de entrenamiento para el primer equipo y las secciones inferiores de fútbol, residencias y doce campos de juego, incluyendo el Estadio Alfredo Di Stéfano.[61]​\n\nA lo largo de su historia, el equipo madridista ha visto como el nombre del club variaba por diversas circunstancias hasta la denominación actual de Real Madrid Castilla Club de Fútbol, vigente desde 2005. El club filial se inició bajo el nombre de Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, cuando en 1947 se oficializa el acuerdo de colaboración con la entidad de seguros, y con el de Castilla Club de Fútbol tras su oficialización en 1972.\n\nA continuación se listan las distintas denominaciones de las que ha dispuesto el club a lo largo de su historia:\n• Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra: (1947-1972) Nombre bajo el acuerdo como filial con la A. D. Plus Ultra.\n• Castilla Club de Fútbol: (1972-1990) Oficialización y compra de los derechos como filial a la A. D. Plus Ultra.\n• Real Madrid Club de Fútbol \"B\": (1991-2005) Cambio tras la normativa de la RFEF respecto a equipos filiales.\n• Real Madrid Castilla Club de Fútbol: (2005-Act.) Recuperación de la histórica denominación tras recibir el permiso de la RFEF.\n\nEl Castilla C. F. acumula en sus más de 66 años de historia como filial madridista numerosos trofeos nacionales. Entre sus mejores actuaciones destacan por importancia, una Liga —complementada con otras diez de divisiones inferiores— y un subcampeonato de la Copa del Rey que le permitió lograr el mayor logro deportivo de su historia: una participación en competición continental —concretamente en la Recopa de Europa y siendo equipo de Segunda División—, siendo el único filial en la historia del fútbol en lograr los tres citados honores.[62]​\n\nPosee tres récords únicos, el de único club militante de la Segunda División de España en disputar una competición europea en España, la Recopa de Europa en la temporada 1980-81 donde fue eliminado en treintaidosavos de final; el de único club filial europeo en disputar una competición internacional, la ya citada Recopa de Europa; y ser el único equipo filial en disputar una final de Copa del Rey. Estos dos últimos son inigualables al no estar ya permitida la participación de filiales tanto en competición europea como en la Copa del Rey.\n\nA raíz de su clasificación para la Recopa de Europa por su papel en la anterior Copa del Rey donde fue subcampeón tras enfrentarse al primer equipo, tanto la UEFA como la RFEF iniciaron un proceso de modificación de las normativas, efecto en la temporada 1990-91, para evitar que cualquier otro club filial pudiese participar tanto en competición nacional como internacional —a excepción de la Liga que le corresponda, siempre en divisiones inferiores a la de su primer equipo—.\n\nNota: en negrita competiciones vigentes en la actualidad. Indicado el récord del torneo\n\nSuma unos números a lo largo de sus participaciones ligueras que le han permitido colocarse en la vigesimosegunda posición histórica de la Segunda División, entre sus 172 participantes históricos,[n 11]​ superando a numerosos primeros equipos que pueden participar —a diferencia de los castillistas— en la máxima categoría del fútbol nacional. Es el mejor equipo filial en la historia del campeonato merced a sus 33 temporadas de participación,[n 12]​ y el único entre ellos en haberse proclamado campeón de la categoría,[63]​ la cual es su mejor resultado histórico. El peor lo sufrió en dos campañas, con un decimoctavo puesto.[n 13]​\n\nSu debut en Segunda División de produjo en la temporada 1949-50 en un partido frente a la Unión Deportiva Salamanca que finalizó con victoria del equipo filial madrileño —bajo su antigua denominación de A. D. Plus Ultra— por cuatro goles a tres. En lo referente a goleadas, el equipo logró su mejor victoria en la temporada 1960-61 cuando derrotó al Real Jaén Club de Fútbol por un contundente 11-0,[64]​ mientras que su peor resultado fue en la temporada 1988-89 cuando cayó derrotado frente a la Real Zaragoza por 7-0, quien fue el vencedor final de dicho torneo.[65]​\n\nEn la segunda competición por importancia, el Campeonato de España de Copa, lo disputó un total de treinta ocasiones antes de que la RFEF modificase los estatutos prohibiendo disputarla a los equipos filiales. Pese a ello, sumó un subcampeonato en 1979-80 como mejor resultado, que le permitió disputar la Recopa de Europa y ser el único equipo filial en disputarla en la historia del torneo. Su peor participación en Copa la repitió en diez ocasiones al ser eliminado en la primera ronda.[66]​\n\nDesde la temporada 1990-91 el Real Madrid Castilla C. F. no puede disputar la Copa del Rey debido a la nueva normativa de la RFEF sobre equipos filiales.\n\nHasta la temporada 1977-78 no existía la Segunda División \"B\" de fútbol en España por lo que la Tercera División —hasta entonces la tercera categoría del país—, pasó a convertirse en la cuarta categoría en detrimento de la nueva división creada. Del mismo modo, en 2021 hubo una nueva reestructuración en la que las nuevas categorías de la Federación conformaron un nuevo sistema. Así, la Segunda División \"B\" fue sustituida por la Primera Federación, y la Tercera por la Segunda División RFEF.\n\nLa Primera División y la Segunda División son las categorías profesionales de fútbol en España desde su creación en el año 1929, debido a la profesionalización de este deporte en 1925.\n\nEl equipo podría haber ascendido en tres ocasiones a la Primera División, pero por su condición de filial finalmente su derecho a ascender directamente o jugar la promoción de ascenso le correspodería al siguiente clasificado en la Liga. Estas fueron las temporadas de 1983-84, 1987-88 y 1995-96.\n\nAntes de ser nombrado Castilla C. F., por el primigenio Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra pasaron jugadores como José María Zárraga, Pedro Casado, José María Vidal, Fernando Serena, Goyo Benito, Enrique Mateos o Ramón Grosso, que posteriormente integraron e hicieron carrera en el primer equipo del club, el Real Madrid Club de Fútbol,[67]​ así como otros jugadores internacionales reconocidos del fútbol patrio como Juan Manuel Villa, Feliciano Rivilla, Luis Aragonés, José Macías o Ángel Lanchas.[68]​\n\nMás tarde, por las filas del Real Madrid Castilla han pasado históricos jugadores del primer equipo procedentes de «la fábrica blanca» como: José Antonio Camacho, Isidoro San José, Isidro Díaz, García Hernández, Agustín Rodríguez, Ricardo Gallego, Francisco Pineda, José Manuel Ochotorena, Miguel Porlán Chendo, Emilio Butragueño, Míchel González, Martín Vázquez, Manolo Sanchís, Sebastián Losada, Raúl González, José María Gutiérrez Guti, Álvaro Benito, Iker Casillas, Paco Pavón, Álvaro Arbeloa, Esteban Granero, Rubén de la Red, Nacho Fernández, Dani Carvajal, Lucas Vázquez, Carlos Casemiro, Fede Valverde o Vinícius Júnior, así como futbolistas que han desarrollado el grueso de su carrera en otros equipos importantes como Juan Macua, Rafa Benítez, Juan Señor, Javier Castañeda, Javier Maté, Rafael García Cortés, Poli Rincón, Miguel Pardeza —integrante histórico de la «Quinta del Buitre»—, José Aurelio Gay, Enrique Velasco, Pepe Mel, Julio Llorente, Julen Lopetegui, José Luis Caminero, Santiago Cañizares, Ismael Urzaiz, Torres Mestre, Christopher Ohen, Mutiu Adepoju, Juan Esnáider, Luis Miguel Ramis, Dani García, José Luis Morales, Samuel Eto'o, Fernando Sanz —hijo de Lorenzo Sanz—, Luis García, Esteban Cambiasso, David Barral, Miguel Ángel Ferrer Mista, Alberto Rivera, Roberto Soldado —quien es el máximo goleador histórico del filial madridista—, Juanfran Torres, Iván Sánchez-Rico Riki, Diego López, Filipe Luís, Álvaro Negredo, Borja Valero, Juan Mata, Dani Parejo, Javi García, José Callejón, Álvaro Morata, Pablo Sarabia, o Álex Fernández, Jesé Rodríguez, Denís Chéryshev, Antonio Adán, Raúl de Tomás, Diego Llorente, Fernando Pacheco, Rubén Yáñez, Marcos Llorente, Borja Mayoral, Martin Ødegaard, Mario Hermoso, Achraf Hakimi o Sergio Reguilón como ejemplos.[67]​\n\nNota: En negrita los jugadores activos en el club.\n\nMerecen ser destacadas algunas generaciones de futbolistas del club como la generación que posteriormente conformó el «Madrid de los García» —plantilla subcampeona de la Copa de Europa que consiguió alcanzar la final del máximo torneo continental tras quince años de ausencia— o los integrantes de la «Quinta del Buitre» —equipo que conquistó cinco Ligas consecutivas y dos Copas de la UEFA—. En lo individual, los canteranos Emilio Butragueño y Raúl González fueron galardonados con dos Balones de Bronce el primero, y un Balón de Plata y un Bronze FIFA World Player el segundo.\n• Como exigen las normas de la RFEF, los dorsales de los futbolistas se comprenderán entre los números 1 y 23, reservando el 1 y el 13 para los guardametas. En caso de ser necesario un tercer guardameta con licencia en el primer equipo se le reservará el dorsal número 24. Del dorsal 25 en adelante serán a todos los efectos jugadores pertenecientes a equipos filiales o dependientes, y como tales, podrán compaginar partidos con ambos equipos. Dichos jugadores deberán portar un dorsal fijo en cada uno de los partidos que intervengan.\n• Según normativa UEFA, un canterano debe permanecer al menos tres años en edad formativa en el club (15-21 años) para ser considerado como tal. 72 ​\n• Los equipos de la Primera Federación no están limitados a tener en la plantilla un número máximo de jugadores sin pasaporte de la Unión Europea. Según normativa UEFA, cada club solo puede tener en plantilla un máximo de tres jugadores extracomunitarios que ocupen plaza de extranjero. La lista incluye sólo la principal nacionalidad de cada jugador, algunos de los jugadores no europeos tienen otra nacionalidad de algún país de la UE:\n• None Los precios no se incluye IVA o sumas por objetivos, ya que no han sido efectivos.\n\nEl vigente entrenador desde 2019 es Raúl González —quien fuera integrante tanto del filial como del primer equipo, además de ser el jugador con más partidos disputados como madridista (741) y su máximos goleador histórico al momento de su retirada profesional (323 goles)—.[75]​ Tras superar el curso de entrenador UEFA Pro[76]​ pasó a formar parte de las divisiones inferiores del club en donde fue desarrollando su labor como técnico por las diferentes categorías logrando varios campeonatos.[77]​ En la temporada 2019-20 se convierte en el primer entrenador del filial, y momentáneamente del juvenil tras suspenderse las competiciones por la pandemia de COVID-19, para proclamarse Campeón de Europa.[78]​ Retomadas las competiciones, el equipo obtuvo plaza en la nueva Primera Federación.\n\nEntre los entrenadores del club también figuran otros exjugadores del club como Antonio Ruiz, Manuel Sanchís, Juan Santisteban —quien más partidos dirigió—, Amancio Amaro —quien dirigió a la «Quinta del Buitre»—, Ramón Grosso, Vicente del Bosque, Mariano García Remón, Rafa Benítez, Francisco García Hernández, Toni Grande, Paco Buyo, Míchel González, Zinedine Zidane o Santiago Solari por citar algunos.[79]​ Antes de todos ellos, cuando el equipo era aún la Agrupación Deportiva Plus Ultra, contó con ilustres exintegrantes del club como Antonio Bonet,[80]​ o Miguel Muñoz —antes de convertirse en el entrenador con más partidos dirigidos del primer equipo—.[81]​\n\nPese a que el club y sus competencias pertenecen al Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, el equipo filial ha contado con presidencia propia desde sus inicios hasta el año 1990. Tras dieciséis años sin presidente propio, y siendo el presidente de la entidad Florentino Pérez, instauró el 28 de julio de 2006 de nuevo el antiguo privilegio a Francisco Moreno Cariñena, socio de la entidad y compromisario desde 1982, nombrándole así primer máximo mandatario del filial blanco desde hacía décadas. El mandatario ya fue además directivo del Castilla desde 1988 hasta la llegada de Ramón Mendoza a la presidencia blanca. Este último fue sucedido en el cargo por Lorenzo Sanz.\n\nEn la actualidad la presidencia del equipo filial recae en Nicolás Martín-Sanz, tras suceder en el cargo al guadalajareño, quien obtuviese el cargo en el año 2009.\n\nA continuación se listan los presidentes de la historia del club filial:\n• None (2008).

WOW, what a wild ride it’s been!! But all worth it!! We celebrated our 2nd YEAR ANIVERSAY in APRIL 2024!! Crazy how time flies!!\n\nWhere our location has changed, our food and who we are has not. Barn Nork may have a new look from what some remember, but our goal is still the same; to cook food that makes you happy. What we do is basic; and honest. Our food is prepared with love, integrity and the highest quality ingredients we can possibly get our hands on. We care about you, and the food we feed you!!\n\nOur menu is ever changing however some dishes have become a mainstay for our regulars and local guests. We encourage people to explore our food and try new things, but at the same time, take comfort in dishes that give you joy.\n\nYou’ll see lots of the traditional Barn Nork usuals - Green Curry, Beef Massaman and of course Pad Thai, with features changing monthly. As we move forward, we’ll dig deeper into our roots to bring you more “street food”, a variety of “snacks/smaller plates” and eventually more noodle dishes!! We’re also working on baked goods and more flavours of ice-cream and sorbets!!\n\nOur Riverside location is quite small with just FOUR TABLES, as 75% of our restaurant is kitchen!! We have very limited sit-down-dining as we’re more of a “Thai market/industrial kitchen sorta place”, primarily serving take-out. Our little joint really “rocks” sometimes as we are blessed to be super busy, most of the time. We do our best to take as many orders as we can without jeopardizing the quality and care of our food. We’d rather is take a bit more time so it’s 100% delicious!!\n\nSummer months, allow us to have access to more outdoor space. You can order take-out, grab a drink and sit on the patio, or pull up a seat at our rail-side bar; plus, LOTS of green space in the park to through down a blanket and chill. AND DOGS? Dogs are always welcome!! Our love of dogs is equal, if not more than our love of food…..we’re not kidding!! Other than food, dogs are our life❤️\n\nThere are no “bells and whistles” at Barn Nork. We are casual, simple people and our food is a refection of what’s in our heart. There is no deliberate fusion-style adjustments or modern-day twists incorporated into how we cook, it’s just food from our perspective based what we love to eat and on what we grew up eating in Chang Mai. And it’s important to us you are full at the end of your meal!!\n\nEight-plus years ago when we started this adventure with fingers crossed, we never, EVER, EVER, imagined we could be so lucky to end up here!!?? It is our dream come true. We know that sounds “corny”, but it really is the truth.\n\nWe hope you enjoy what we have built and what we have to offer!!\n\nWe are grateful beyond words ❤️Revista de Valparaíso - Memoria Chilena: Cansados de contemplar el marasmo en que vegetan las letras en nuestro país [...], hacemos nuestra primera salida.\n\n\n\n Revista de Valparaíso tuvo tres apariciones durante el siglo XIX, en tres fechas distintas: 1842, 1873 y 1898. En los tres casos se trató de revistas diferentes que no tuvieron como objetivo homenajear a su predecesora, sino ser punto central de debate, difusión de ideas y textos literarios.\n\nLa utilización de este nombre en tres ocasiones se explica por el significativo rol que cumplió Valparaíso durante el siglo XIX en la sociedad chilena. Este puerto fue el principal punto de entrada de mercadería y tecnología, y también el principal acceso de ideas progresistas que se renovaban con más rapidez que el que podía ser procesado por los medios de comunicación. Por tal motivo, Valparaíso fue una ciudad fundamental para el desarrollo del pensamiento ilustrado, de la discusión política y del campo cultural. Esto queda de manifiesto en la presencia de importantes periódicos, librerías, imprentas, bibliotecas y revistas.\n\nEl historiador Armando de Ramón sostiene que hacia fines del siglo XIX y comienzos del XX, en plena época de esplendor, Valparaíso era más cosmopolita y tolerante en sus tradiciones que Santiago, ciudad \"esencialmente chilena\" y con una tradición católica más arraigada (133). El rasgo cosmopolita se ve reflejado y potenciado por la gran cantidad de extranjeros residentes que aportaban al progreso y desarrollo de Valparaíso. Tanto así que, en el año 1885, en una ciudad que contaba con 115.147 habitantes, los extranjeros suman 7664.\n\nEn Valparaíso la publicación de periódicos, diarios y revistas se cuenta \"por decenas y centenares; grandes y pequeños, de duración más bien efímera la mayoría\" (Castagneto, Piero. \"Bosquejo histórico de la prensa en Valparaíso (1826-1973)\". 239). Ninguno con la relevancia de El Mercurio, pero son muchos los medios escritos y de diferente naturaleza que dan \"cuenta del devenir de Valparaíso, desde hace casi dos siglos\" (Ibíd.), muchos de ellos con clara intención literaria.\n\nAsí, en el año 1842 apareció la primera Revista de Valparaíso, cuya importancia radicó en ser la primera revista en el país. En sus páginas, una elite intelectual proyectó una mirada conservadora y pendiente de lo que sucedía en el comercio en Europa y en los cambios que experimenta la sociedad chilena. Por su parte, la segunda Revista de Valparaíso, publicada en el año 1873, tuvo como figura central a la escritora y primera novelista chilena Rosario Orrego de Uribe. Finalmente, la tercera Revista de Valparaíso apareció hacia 1898, con un espíritu más magazinesco y con un impacto social, político y literario menor.\n\nEntre los colaboradores que publicaron en las tres versiones de Revista Valparaíso destacan escritores ligados a las sociedades ilustradas y a la intelectualidad liberal, tales como Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Juan Bautista Alberdi, Diego Barros Arana, Miguel Luis Amunátegui, así como a otros intelectuales que experimentaban con variedad de géneros como la crónica sobre temas económicos, de relevancia urbana y la escritura de poesía.Valparaíso y su Salud: Algunas Notas para el Estudio de la Gestión Hospitalaria (1906 – 1918) | Fronteira: Journal of Social, Technological and Environmental Science: Boletín de Estadística Industrial de la República de Chile, 1894-1895.

I am also a Caucasian person (relevant I think). I also have a natural fro, think Jewfro or something. (I'm not exaggerating when I refer to it as a fro, it is a big, round puffball of curls from my head)\n\nI have a friend group, almost all of us knew each other in high school. I'm not sure exactly how relevant this detail is, but almost everyone in the group is a person of color.\n\nWe get together every once in a while and the last time we we met up, the topic of cultural appropriation came up. Topics like this are not unusual for us as we sometimes talk about political or societal topics. We all have the same left wing beliefs so it's easy for us to talk about these things.\n\nIn the discussion about cultural appropriation, fros came up. (Afros more specifically) I didn't really think much of it for a while as it makes sense to me that someone mimicking the hair style of people of color would be offensive. I didn't really contribute to the conversation except for nodding along as I agree with what they say, but can't really add to it as I am white.\n\nAt some point in the conversation, I started to feel like people were looking at me. Not like conversational looks but kind of like looking me up and down before glancing away and repeating. I brushed this off as I've had issues with social anxiety when I was little so most of the time when I feel insecure I figure it's just my anxiety bursting through my medication to bite me in the butt.\n\nHowever, after a few minutes of feeling this way one friend commented how weird it was that I have my hair in a fro despite being white. All of my friends are well aware that my hair is completely natural and I don't do anything to get it this way, so I was taken aback.\n\nA few other people chimed in saying stuff like I should straighten it and that I was adding to racial tension and making people see me and think it's okay to appropriate fros.\n\nI snapped and said \"I'm sorry I was born this way\". I was using a loud tone which I'm not proud of as I myself am very adverse to anything that resembles yelling. (I wouldn't say I yelled, but I was speaking noticeably louder than the volume we'd maintained).\n\nSome of my friends looked disappointed while others looked kind of disgusted and they all kind of just left after that.\n\nIf anything I think ITA for how I responded but I'm also asking if ITA for having my hair like this? I'd talk to other friends or family about this, but I'm worried about them being disappointed in me. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nThank you to all of you who commented, which by now is a surprising amount. I appreciate all of the advice you guys gave. I'm still trying to get through all the comments and haven't even begun to try to respond to any of them. Not entirely sure if this counts as an update.\n\nI've spent a while mulling over advice. An overwhelming amount of you suggested that I stop considering these people friends along with a lot of people who suggested that they may have never been friends in the first place.\n\nReading responses has given me a new perspective on this, as I came here expecting ITA but wanting more of a view of which for and why.\n\nTo get it straight off the bat, I don't want to stop being friends with these guys, not unless it really comes down to it. I don't think this stems from prejudice or malice as some people believed, I think rather it came from ignorance and misunderstanding.\n\nI'm going to reach out to them in the coming days and try to explain my renewed view and maybe even share some of the comments with them. These are people I've known for years. We've helped each other through dark times and celebrated good times. If they're are completely unreceptive then I don't think we'll remain friends, but I don't want to lose these people for something that can be worked out. My hope is just that we can work through this and be better for it.\n\nThanks especially to people expressing concern for my wellbeing and their views on similar matters. Even bigger thanks to those who expressed concern for my hairs wellbeing and the idea to use hair products made for people of color. For some reason that I can only attribute to sheer lack of attention for my hair and it's health, I'd never really considered this. When I think about it, I'm coming out of this with friendship tips, worldviewing tips, and hair tips.\n\nI suppose more than anything right now I'm just tired. I feel like I need to just curl up in my bed for three days, but this is a bump in the road that I wish to overcome\n\nI highly doubt I'll update this. I decided not to post this on my main account so it wouldn't be associated with browsing on this site for obvious reasons. I'll try to get back to at least some comments. I guess more than anything this \"update\" is just to say thanks for caring enough to give me advice, whether it was a single word or three paragraphs.Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy.Search Documents (Preview) - Azure AI Search: Applies to: 2023-07-01-Preview. This version is no longer supported. Upgrade immediately to a newer version.\n\nA query request targets the documents collection of a single index on a search service. It includes parameters that define the match criteria, and parameters that shape the response. You can also use an index alias to target a particular index instead of using the index name itself.\n\nYou can use GET or POST for most queries, but you must use POST for vector search because vector query parameters don't fit within a URI. Query parameters are specified on the query string for GET requests, and in the request body for POST requests.\n\nIf you're using POST, add the \"search\" action as a URI parameter.\n\nWhen called with GET, the length of the request URL can't exceed 8 KB. This length is enough for most applications. However, some applications produce large queries, specifically when OData filter expressions are used. For these applications, HTTP POST is a better choice because it allows larger filters than GET.\n\nWith POST, the number of clauses in a filter is the limiting factor, not the size of the raw filter string since the request size limit for POST is approximately 16 MB. Even though the POST request size limit is large, filter expressions can't be arbitrarily complex. For more information about filter complexity limitations, see OData Expression Syntax for Azure AI Search.\n\nRemember to URL-encode specific query parameters when calling the GET REST API directly. For a Search Documents operation, URL-encoding might be necessary for the following query parameters:\n\nURL encoding is only recommended for individual parameters. If you inadvertently URL-encode the entire query string (everything after the ), requests will break.\n\nAlso, URL encoding is only necessary when calling the REST API directly using GET. No URL encoding is necessary when using POST, or when using the Azure AI Search .NET client library, which handles encoding for you.\n\nThe following table describes the required and optional request headers.\n\nFor GET: None.\n\nSometimes Azure AI Search can't return all the requested results in a single Search response. A partial response can happen for different reasons, such as when the query returns too many documents by not specifying $top, or by specifying a value for $ top that's too large. In such cases, Azure AI Search includes the @odata.nextLink annotation in the response body, and also @search.nextPageParameters if it was a POST request. You can use the values of these annotations to formulate another Search request to get the next part of the search response. This behavior is called a continuation of the original Search request, and the annotations are called continuation tokens. See the example in the Response section for details on the syntax of these annotations and where they appear in the response body.\n\nThe reasons why Azure AI Search might return continuation tokens are implementation-specific and subject to change. Robust clients should always be ready to handle cases where fewer documents than expected are returned and a continuation token is included to continue retrieving documents. Also note that you must use the same HTTP method as the original request in order to continue. For example, if you sent a GET request, any continuation requests you send must also use GET (and likewise for POST).\n\nA query accepts several parameters on the URL when called with GET, and as JSON properties in the request body when called with POST. The syntax for some parameters is slightly different between GET and POST. These differences are noted in the following table.\n\nStatus Code: 200 OK is returned for a successful response. There are two sample responses in this article, one each for semantic search and featuresMode.\n\nThe first example shows the full response for the topmost result for the semantic query \"how do clouds form\".\n• None \"@search.answers\" appears when you specify the answers parameter, and when the query and the targeted fields in the index contain content that can be recognized as an answer. The @search.answers array that has a key, text, and highlights. The score is an indicator of the strength of the answer.\n• None \"value\" is the body of the response. The @search.rerankerScore is assigned by the semantic ranking algorithm and is used to rank results (@search.score is from the BM25 similarity algorithm, used when scoring the initial results). Captions include plain text and highlighted versions. This example was created using OCR and entity recognition skills. Fields for the extracted and merged content are included in the response.\n\nThis example shows \"@search.features\" output from a query that includes featuresMode.\n\nYou can find more examples in OData Expression Syntax for Azure AI Search.\n\nFind documents in the index using simple query syntax. This query returns hotels where searchable fields contain the terms \"comfort\" and \"location\" but not \"motel\":\n\nFind documents in the index using Lucene query syntax (see Lucene query syntax in Azure AI Search). This query returns hotels where the category field contains the term \"budget\" and all searchable fields containing the phrase \"recently renovated\". Documents containing the phrase \"recently renovated\" are ranked higher as a result of the term boost value (3)\n\nInvoke the semantic ranking model with answers, captions, and highlighted content. The response for this query can be found in the previous section.\n\nFor an index that has fields of type and a vector configuration, you can specify vector query parameters. Vector query parameters include the vector fields that are in-scope for the query, the \"k\" number of top hits to return, and a vector representation of the query input.\n\nAdding a \"select\" parameter is helpful if the index includes text fields. Matching and relevance are based on vectors, but fields containing human-readable content are more useful to someone reading the results. Alternatively, you can write code that converts the vector data in your search results to text.\n\nSearch the index and return results sorted by date in descending order.\n\nExample: filter using an OData expression\n\nIn a faceted search, search the index and retrieve facets for categories, ratings, tags, as well as items with baseRate in specific ranges.\n\nNotice the last facet is on a sub-field. Facets count the parent document (Hotels) and not intermediate subdocuments (Rooms), so the response will determine the number of hotels that have any rooms in each price bucket.\n\nUsing a filter, narrow down the previous faceted query result after the user selects Rating 3 and category \"Motel\".\n\nExample: faceted search with limits on each category\n\nIn a faceted search, set an upper limit on unique terms returned in a query. The default is 10, but you can increase or decrease this value using the count parameter on the facet attribute. This example returns facets for city, limited to 5.\n\nSearch the index within specific fields (for example, a language field)\n\nSearch the index across multiple fields. For example, you can store and query searchable fields in multiple languages, all within the same index. If English and French descriptions coexist in the same document, you can return any or all in the query results:\n\nYou can only query one index at a time. Don't create multiple indexes for each language unless you plan to query one at a time.\n\nGet the first page of items (page size is 10):\n\nGet the second page of items (page size is 10):\n\nSearch the index and return fragments with hit highlights:\n\nSearch the index and return documents sorted from closer to farther away from a reference location:\n\nExample: \"find by me\" (boost relevance of nearby locations\n\nSearch the index assuming there's a scoring profile called \"geo\" with two distance scoring functions, one defining a parameter called \"currentLocation\" and one defining a parameter called \"lastLocation\". In the following example, \"currentLocation\" has a delimiter of a single dash ( ). It's followed by longitude and latitude coordinates, where longitude is a negative value.\n\nExample: query over full index instead of shards\n\nFind documents in the index while favoring consistent scoring over lower latency. This query calculates document frequencies across the whole index, and makes a best effort at targeting the same replica for all queries within the same \"session\", which helps generate a stable and reproducible ranking.\n\nFind documents in the index and return a list of information retrieval features for each result describing the scoring between the matched document and the query. The query also calculates document frequencies across the whole index to produce more consistent scoring.\n\nAn example of a response that includes looks similar to the following:\n\nThis section provides details about parameters that are too complex to cover in the main table.\n\nValid values for the queryLanguage parameter are provided in the following table, in the \"queryLanguage\" column, and aren't case-sensitive. The default for the parameter as a whole is \"en-us\". Within each language, there's a default variant for each two-character language code. For example, if you specify \"es\", then \"es-us\" is used by default. The queryLanguage parameter is required for a query request that includes \"queryType=semantic\" or \"speller=lexicon\". There's only one queryLanguage value for the entire request, and that value will be used for semantic ranking, captions, answers, and speller (there's no override for individual features).\n\nAt this time, language support varies by feature. Only English, Spanish, French, and German are supported for the full set of features, but notice that spell check implements fewer variants.\n\nIf you specify a language code that isn't supported by a given feature, such as EN-GB with speller, the service returns HTTP 400.\n\nFor more information about using each feature, see Enable semantic ranking and captions, Return a semantic answer, and Add spell check to queries.\n\nThe \"(preview)\" designation indicates that validation testing across all features (semantic ranking, captions, answers, and spell check) is either ongoing or pending. We encourage the use of all of the language variants in the following table, but recommend more testing of preview languages to ensure the results are valid for your content. Languages with a check mark and no preview designation have been validated using equivalent data sets, with measurable gain in relevance."}

The song was written by the band's second bassist, Gary Valentine, shortly before he left for a solo career prior to the recording of Plastic Letters; his departure necessitated Chris Stein playing bass on the album, as well as guitar. During recording Blondie was still signed to their old label, Private Stock Records. The album peaked at No. 10 in the UK and has been certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). The pink dress Debbie Harry wears in the cover art was designed by Anya Phillips.[4]\n\nPlastic Letters has been remastered digitally and reissued twice: the first time by Chrysalis Records in 1994 with two bonus tracks, and the second in 2001 by EMI-Capitol with four bonus tracks. The latter issue features the earliest demo of the band's future hit \"Heart of Glass\", then known as \"The Disco Song\".\n\nThe Globe and Mail wrote that \"some of Blondie's hardness has been made pliable with curious arrangements and an attempt to make the band seem more formidable than it really is.\"[13]\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Plastic Letters.[14]Amazon.com: Plastic Letters: CDs y Vinilo: Recoger en las ubicaciones de recolección cercanas\n\nSelecciona la opción “Recolección” en la página del producto o al proceder al pago.\n\nUna vez que tu paquete esté listo para recolección, recibirás una notificación por correo electrónico y por la aplicación.\n\nLleva tu identificador de pedido o el aviso de entrega (si aplica) a la ubicación de recolección elegida para recoger tu paquete.Sign Letters & Logos – Formed Plastic | Signage: Letters have pads at the bottom and pad/stud combinations at the top of the letter.

The population was 566 at the time of the 2020 census.[2]\n\nSwea City was platted in 1892; it was then called Reynolds. In February 1893, the name was officially changed to Swea City.[3] Swea City was petitioned for incorporation on December 11, 1894 with a population of 161. Several objections were filed with the reasons for objection listed as, \"One, the judges of the election administered the oath to themselves swearing in each other; and Two, the words 'for incorporation' were written on one ballot while 'against corporation' was written on another ballot.\" It was implied that the choice needed to be available on a single ballot in order to be valid. Later a second petition was filed this time on April 19, 1895 and the election was held at a schoolhouse. Each ballot had \"For incorporation\" and \"Against incorporation\" printed on them. The vote was 34 in favor of incorporation and 1 against, and the city was incorporated.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 0.74 square miles (1.92 km2), all land.[5]\n\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Swea City has a hot-summer humid continental climate, abbreviated \"Dfa\" on climate maps.\n\nAs of the census of 2020,[9] there were 566 people, 257 households, and 133 families residing in the city.

This family is one of the largest among lichen-forming fungi and is globally distributed, from Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests, favouring humid environments while being intolerant of arid conditions. Molecular phylogenetics has significantly advanced the understanding of their complex taxonomic history, revealing intricate evolutionary relationships and leading to a refined classification. Notable members include reindeer moss and cup lichens of the genus Cladonia, which consist of about 500 species and forms a significant part of the diet for large mammals in taiga and tundra ecosystems.\n\nA distinctive feature of many Cladoniaceae species is their dimorphic thallus: a scaly or crust-like form and a (shrub-like) secondary form known as a podetium or . These lichens typically grow on soil, decaying wood, or tree trunks, with a few species found on rocks. They form symbiotic associations with green algae, usually from the genus Asterochloris. The family is known for its diverse secondary metabolites—over 70 have been identified—which play roles in species identification and ecological functions such as protection against UV radiation and herbivore deterrence. Genomic studies have uncovered significant variation in mitochondrial DNA among Cladoniaceae species, contributing to the understanding of their evolution and diversity.\n\nSome Cladoniaceae species have economic value, particularly in decorative uses such as floral arrangements and model-making due to their unique structures. Six species are included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species, facing threats from habitat loss, climate change, and human activities. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect these vulnerable species.\n\nBefore the term 'lichen' was widely adopted, one of the earliest classification systems for these organisms was developed by the German botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius. In his 1741 system, Cladonia species were placed within the genus Coralloides. In his Species Plantarum, Carl Linnaeus formally described several species that are now classified within the Cladoniaceae. Although he initially placed them in the eponymously named genus Lichen, a dozen of these species are recognised as belonging to the genus Cladonia.[6] Among these was Cladonia pyxidata, a representative of the \"pixie cup\" or \"trumpet\" lichens—so named for their distinctive shape, as well as some well-known and widespread Cladonia species: C. coccifera, C. cornuta, C. deformis, C. digitata, C. fimbriata, C. gracilis, C. portentosa, C. rangiferina, C. stellaris, C. subulata, and C. uncialis. These 12 species represent about 14% of the 80 Lichen species Linnaeus described in his seminal 1753 work.[6]\n\nThe German naturalist Jonathan Carl Zenker formally introduced the Cladoniaceae to science in 1827, with his work appearing in a publication edited by Karl Goebel.[1] Zenker's initial concept of the family included genera such as Baeomyces, Icmadophila, and Stereocaulon, which have since been reclassified into separate families due to advances in taxonomic understanding. William Nylander included 53 Cladonia species worldwide in his 1860 work Synopsis lichenum.[9] When Edvard August Vainio published his three-volume monograph on the Cladoniaceae (Monographia Cladoniarum universalis, 1887,[10] 1894,[11] and 1897[12]), he included 134 species and subspecies. In his circumscription of the family, the genera Pycnothelia, Cladia, and Cladina were included in the genus Cladonia. In recent history, Teuvo Ahti's extensive research, including comprehensive monographs and revisions, has significantly advanced the understanding of Cladoniaceae taxonomy and biogeography.[14]\n\nCladoniaceae is now one of the largest families of lichen-forming fungi,[15] with about 560 species distributed amongst 18 genera. The type genus is Cladonia, circumscribed by the Irish physician and botanist Patrick Browne in 1756. He included eight species in his new genus. Of their occurrence, he wrote: \"All these species are found in great abundance in the mountains of Liguanea: they grow mostly on the ground, among other sorts of moss, but a few ... species chiefly are found upon the decaying trunks of trees.\"[16]\n\nAs is standard practice in botanical nomenclature,[17] the name Cladoniaceae is based on the name of the type genus, Cladonia, with the ending -aceae indicating the rank of family. The genus name comprises the Greek word: κλάδος (klādos), meaning \"branch\", \"bud\", or \"shoot\"; and the Latin -ia, a suffix commonly used in Latin to form nouns, particularly in taxonomy to denote genera.[18]\n\nIt is well known that reindeer feed on lichens, which has led to the widespread but misleading name \"reindeer moss\". This common name, along with \"reindeer lichen\" and \"caribou lichen\", is typically applied to the ground-dwelling, mat-forming species that were previously classified in the genus Cladina. Cladonia species with cup-shaped structures borne at the tips of vertical stalks (podetia) are often known as \"pixie cups\". Examples include the \"boreal pixie cup\" (C. borealis), the \"finger pixie cup\" (C. digitata), and the \"red-fruited pixie cup\" (C. pleurota) Additional names alluding to these characteristic structures include the \"powdered funnel lichen\" (C. cenotea), and the \"trumpet lichen\" (C. fimbriata). Some names reference the reddish hue of their fruiting structures, such as \"British soldiers\" (C. cristatella), the \"jester lichen\" (C. leporina), and the \"lipstick powderhorn\" (C. macilenta).\n\nMolecular phylogenetics studies have significantly advanced the scientific understanding of relationships within the Cladoniaceae, particularly in the large and diverse genus Cladonia. Early studies in the early 2000s began to reveal the complexity of relationships within the family, challenging traditional morphology-based classifications. More recent comprehensive analyses have identified 13 major clades within Cladonia, providing a framework for understanding the genus's evolution and diversity. These clades, while generally well-supported by molecular data, often lack clear morphological synapomorphies (shared physical characteristics inherited from a common ancestor), highlighting the challenges in Cladonia taxonomy. Some clades, such as clade Erythrocarpae (characterised by red apothecia) and clade Ochroleucae (with pale ochraceous apothecia), do share distinctive features. However, most clades encompass a wide range of morphological and chemical variation.[29]\n\nWithin these clades, several species complexes have been identified, such as the Cladonia gracilis group and the Cladonia humilis group. These complexes often include morphologically similar species that are difficult to distinguish based on traditional taxonomic characters. Molecular studies have revealed that many of these complexes contain cryptic diversity, with genetically distinct lineages that are not easily recognisable morphologically.[29]\n\nFocused molecular studies have further refined the understanding of specific groups within Cladoniaceae. For instance, detailed analyses of the Cladonia furcata complex have revealed high levels of homoplasy (the occurrence of similar traits due to convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry) in the morphological characters traditionally used for species delimitation. Similarly, studies on the Cladonia cariosa group and the Cladonia pyxidata group have uncovered previously unrecognised diversity and highlighted the need for integrative approaches combining molecular, morphological, and chemical data in species delimitation. These phylogenetic studies have also shed light on biogeographic patterns within Cladoniaceae. For example, some clades show distinct geographic distributions, such as a group of predominantly African species within clade Perviae, while others have more cosmopolitan distributions. Morphologically distinct genera like Carassea, Pycnothelia, and Metus form a sister clade to Cladonia. These genera share some morphological and chemical traits, such as dimorphic thalli and the production of atranorin. However, their geographic distributions vary, with Carassea being endemic to Brazil, while Pycnothelia has a bipolar distribution (i.e., found in the high latitudes of both hemispheres) and Metus is found primarily in Australasia.[29]\n\nGenomic studies have revealed significant variation in the size and structure of mitochondrial DNA in Cladoniaceae, uncovering significant variation in genome size and structure. Within the genus Cladonia, mitochondrial genomes span from approximately 45,000 to 66,000 base pairs, consistently containing respiratory genes and ribosomal RNA regions across all examined species. Crustose lichens tend to have smaller mitochondrial genomes compared to their fruticose and foliose counterparts. The genomes often harbour homing endonuclease genes, which may influence genomic evolution. Notably, substantial intraspecific variation has been observed, particularly in widespread species such as C. rangiferina and C. submitis. Unlike some other symbiotic organisms, Cladoniaceae do not exhibit mitochondrial genome reduction, suggesting complex evolutionary dynamics.[30]\n\nSeveral phylogenetic studies have shown that Cladoniaceae is a member of the order Lecanorales, and is closely related to the family Stereocaulaceae.[31][32][33][34][35] The family Cetradoniaceae, which was created in 2002 to contain the endangered species Cetradonia linearis,[3] was folded into the Cladoniaceae in 2006.[36]\n\nIn 2018, Ekaphan Kraichak and colleagues used a technique called temporal banding to reorganise the Lecanoromycetes, proposing a revised system of classification based on correlating taxonomic rank with geological (evolutionary) age. They synonymised the families Squamarinaceae and Stereocaulaceae with the Cladoniaceae, resulting in a large increase in the number of genera and species.[37] The Squamarinaceae had already been included in the Cladoniaceae by previous authors.[15] Although this reorganisation has been used in some later publications,[2] the folding of the Stereocaulaceae into the Cladoniaceae was not accepted in a recent analysis. Robert Lücking highlighted that merging the two families under the name Cladoniaceae is not permissible without a formal conservation proposal because Stereocaulaceae, established in 1826, predates Cladoniaceae, which was established in 1827. According to the rules of botanical nomenclature, the earliest validly published name has priority and must be used when two families are combined unless an exception is granted. This means that if the families were merged without a conservation proposal, the combined family would have to be named Stereocaulaceae due to its earlier establishment.[38] In a 2021 treatment of the British and Irish Cladoniaceae, the authors also keep these families separate, noting \"both families are monophyletic and easily distinguishable on both morphological and molecular terms\".[39]\n\nThe thallus (body) of Cladoniaceae lichens often have a unique structure known as growth, where two distinct forms develop simultaneously within the same organism.[40] The , which can be short-lived ( ) or long-lasting, grows close to the surface and may appear crusty, leafy, or scaly. From this base, a typically grows upright, bearing the reproductive structures (ascomata).[41] This secondary growth can range from a few millimetres to over 25 centimetres (10 inches) in height.[39] Due to this dual structure, the overall appearance of these lichens can be either fruticose (bushy) or foliose (leafy). However, some species in this family do not develop either the primary thallus or the upright structures, showing variations within the group.[29] As for vegetative propagules, isidia occur rarely in this family, whereas soredia are common.[39]\n\nThe ascomata are in the form of an apothecium, and are , meaning they are of the type – light in colour and soft in consistency. They often have a reduced margin.[41] Their colour is typically dark brown (sometimes pale brown), red, ochraceous, or black.[29] The (referring to all hyphae between the asci in the hymenium) consists of sparsely branched paraphyses, and is amyloid, indicating that stains blue to blue-black with iodine-based reagents. The asci (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat , meaning they have two layers that separate during ascus dehiscence. The ascus structure consists of an and a tube (both of which are amyloid), which is cylindrical to (club-shaped). number eight per ascus, and they are usually non-septate (lacking internal partitions), ellipsoid to more or less spherical in shape, hyaline (translucent), and non-amyloid.[41] Except for a few genera that produce septate ascospores (Calathaspis, Pycnothelia and Pilophorus), the hymenium does not generally have that are useful in taxonomy.[29] The conidiomata (asexual fruiting bodies) are in the form of pycnidia; the conidia (asexual spores) are non-septate, usually (thread-like), and hyaline.[41]\n\nIn the Cladoniaceae, over 70 different secondary metabolites (lichen products), primarily polyphenols, have been identified. These substances crucial roles in species identification and have ecological functions such as protection against UV radiation and deterrence of herbivores. To observe the fluorescence of certain depsides and depsidones, ultraviolet light is directly applied to the specimens. Traditional colour spot tests with reagents like KOH can be ineffective at low concentrations. Consequently, thin-layer chromatography, a laboratory technique used to separate chemical compounds, is essential for detecting and identifying lichen substances that are present in low concentrations.[42] Chemotaxonomy is an important aspect in the identification of Gray's pixie cup (Cladonia grayi): when lit by a UV light, it produces a light blue fluorescence.\n\nThe symbiotic algal partner (photobiont) of most Cladoniaceae taxa are unicellular green algae, usually in the genus Asterochloris, but occasionally in the genus Chlorella;[42] both of these genera are in the class Trebouxiophyceae. Eleven species of Asterochloris have found to be associated with genus Cladonia; the algal genus – one of the most common lichen symbionts – occurs in the thalli of more than 20 lichen genera.[44] The most common photobionts in this genus that associate with Cladonia are A. glomerata, A. italiana, and A. mediterranea, with some lineages showing dominance in one or several climatic regions.[45] In contrast, Myrmecia was shown to be the main photobiont for the Mediterranean species Cladonia subturgida.[46] The algal genus Trebouxia, a common lichen photobiont, has not been recorded associating with the Cladoniaceae.[29] Some Pilophorus species form tripartite associations, involving the fungus, green algae, and cyanobacteria within gall-like structures called cephalodia.[42] The cyanobacterial genera Nostoc and Stigonema are involved in these tripartite associations.[29] In a study of several Cladonia lichens collected from Southern Finland, the associated microbial community, which was found to be consistent amongst the different species, consisted largely of Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteriota.[47]\n\nThe development of several Cladoniaceae genera have been studied in detail,[48][49][50][51] although the interpretation of results has sometimes been controversial.[29] For example, two 1970 studies by Hans Jahns explored the development of fruiting bodies in Cladonia, significant for understanding the taxonomy and phylogeny within the Cladoniaceae. This work revealed two distinct ontogenetic types based on the formation of generative tissue and its role in developing the characteristic podetium of Cladonia species. This generative tissue, originating in the thallus horizontalis and growing vertically, is crucial for forming the podetium. The study identified variability within species, showing that different species can have more than one ontogenetic type, challenging previous assumptions about the uniformity of development patterns within the genus. This demonstrated variability had implications for the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships within Cladoniaceae, suggesting a complex evolution of reproductive structures that did not strictly align with previously conceived taxonomic groupings.[52][53]\n\nCladoniaceae species begin development with the formation of a prothallus – a fungal layer upon which an alga-containing thallus will develop. It comprises the hyphae from the germination of an ascospore. After the protothallus contacts the alga, lichenisation begins with the development of small squamules (scale-like thallus segments) that make up the primary thallus, which is squamulose (scaly) or crustose (crustose-like). The secondary thallus consists of vertical structures that are shrubby and hollow, although they can be solid in rare cases. If these structures are made of generative tissue, they are called podetia; when they are made of vegetative tissue, they are called pseudopodetia. The morphology of these structures determines to a large part the taxonomy of the Cladoniaceae, which can range from simple to complex branching patterns.[42] Cladonia minisaxicola, found in the mountains of Bahia (Brazil) is the only species in that large genus that is completely crustose and does not develop podetia.[54]\n\nThe tips of the podetia have a wide range of morphology in the Cladoniaceae. They can be straight, tapering from a wide base to a point (called ), or flaring on cup-shaped . The scyphi are sometimes closed, or have a central perforation, forming structures called funnels.[42] The podetia are slow-growing, with an annual growth rate generally ranging from 1 to 15 mm.\n\nBranching in the Cladoniaceae occurs on the podetium, driven by the growth patterns of fungal meristem tissue at its tip. There are two main branching patterns: in one, branches emerge later from a large meristem that changes shape, while in the other, smaller meristems split early but keep their shape. These growth patterns help scientists understand the evolutionary relationships within Cladoniaceae.[56] A shift from isotropous growth (uniform in all directions) to anisotropous growth (different in various directions) allows for more flexibility in development. This transition, from symmetrical to more irregular growth, may signal evolutionary adaptations. Despite these changes, the branching processes remain highly consistent even among species in the family that are not closely related.[57]\n\nAfter more than a century of discovery and research, including recent advances in understanding revealed by molecular phylogenetics studies, the Cladoniaceae encompass 18 genera and more than 500 species.[15][39] In terms of species diversity, the Cladoniaceae stood as the tenth-largest lichen-forming fungal family by 2017.[15] This is a list of the genera contained within the Cladoniaceae, based on the Catalogue of Life; this includes taxa formerly classified in the Squamarinaceae, but does not include the Stereocaulaceae. Following the genus name is the taxonomic authority, year of publication, and the number of species:\n\nMyelorrhiza was transferred from the Cladoniaceae to the Ramalinaceae by Sonja Kistenich and colleagues in 2018.[72] Neophyllis, originally classified in the Cladoniaceae, was transferred to Sphaerophoraceae in 1999.[73]\n\nCladoniaceae species have been recorded growing in many habitats and on a diversity of substrates, including soil, tree trunks, and rotten wood.[29] In a few cases, Cladoniaceae can grow on rocks, such as Cladonia salmonea which grows on the rock faces of vertical cliffs, or Cladonia pyxidata, which can grow on thin soil on rocks. Cladoniaceae species are generally absent from arid environments due to their preference for humid conditions. The range of their habitats includes boreal forests, bogs, temperate forests, the tundra of the Arctic and Antarctic, man-made habitats (e.g. roadsides), tropical highlands, and the sandy tropical lowlands of the Amazon rainforest.[29]\n\nIn his 2000 monograph on the Cladoniaceae of the Neotropical realm, Ahti included 184 species in 4 genera, and showed that South America is a hotspot of biodiversity for genus Clanodia.[14] Bioclimatic variables significantly influence the distribution of Cladoniaceae species richness in the Neotropics, particularly under conditions of low precipitation and temperature, and high climatic variability. Areas with stable climates and higher temperatures and precipitation tend to support greater species richness.[75] Twenty-six Cladoniaceae species (25 Cladonia and 1 Cladia) are known to occur in the Galápagos Islands. There, some species form mats on lava flows that have developed little soil.[76] A 2013 monograph of Northern European Cladoniaceae treated 100 species (95 Cladonia, 4 Pilophorus, and the monotypic genus Pycnothelia).[77] In the 2021 key to lichen species in Italy, 86 Cladoniaceae are included.[78] In Bulgaria, 55 species in two genera were reported in 2022.[79] In a study of the lichen biodiversity in Kazakhstan's Burabay National Park, the Cladoniaceae made up about 30 percent of the species diversity.[80]\n\nIn western North America, the Coast Mountains of British Columbia act as a key phytogeographic barrier. This results in distinct oceanic and continental taxa groupings on either side. The research also suggests that the southern boundaries of certain species may be determined more by historical rather than purely ecological factors, indicating possible range expansions. The highest diversity of Cladonia species is found in British Columbia between 52°N and 56°N, an area that was covered by glaciers until about 10,000 to 13,000 years ago. The Cladoniaceae biodiversity in this region represents the richest assemblage of the family in western North America. Species diversity declines sharply south of 52°N, with a loss of three to five taxa for each degree of latitude.[81]\n\nThe glacial history of the region has played a crucial role in shaping the current distribution of Cladoniaceae. During the Pleistocene, most species likely survived in areas south of the Cordilleran ice sheet, with some persisting in nunataks, arctic regions, or small coastal refugia. This glacial legacy is still evident in the family's current distribution patterns. Cladoniaceae show a preference for specific habitats, with greater floristic and chemical diversity observed in humid areas and lower forested elevations compared to arid regions and alpine zones. This suggests that many species in the family are adapted to environments with relatively short periods of desiccation. The post-glacial period has seen significant changes in the distribution of Cladoniaceae. Many species that likely existed in Washington, Oregon, and California during the Pleistocene are now absent from these areas. This change is thought to be a result of climate shifts since deglaciation, particularly an increase in summer moisture deficits. While most Cladoniaceae species have reached a stable distribution, some are still in flux. Species like Cladina stellaris and C. trassii appear to be continuing their southward expansion from northern glacial refugia.[81]\n\nEach of the six Cladoniaceae species that have been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature for the global IUCN Red List face a variety of threats impacting their survival. Cetradonia linearis (vulnerable, 2015) is endangered by ecosystem changes in spruce–fir forests, specifically the balsam woolly adelgid's impact on Fraser fir, and changes in humidity regimes and cloud immersion. The species is also vulnerable to threats from logging, mining, and road building if its legal protection status is removed.[82]\n\nCladonia appalachiensis (endangered, 2020) growing on high-elevation Anakeesta Knob rock, faces threats from visitor disruption and changes in cloud cover and humidity.[83] The species is particularly vulnerable due to its restricted range and specific habitat requirements.[29] The main threats to Cladonia perforata (endangered, 2003) include habitat loss, hurricanes, and improper fire management, with a single natural event potentially causing substantial subpopulation reduction.[84]\n\nCladonia submitis (endangered, 2020) is primarily threatened by habitat loss and degradation due to land development, particularly around metropolitan areas. Climate change also poses significant risks through altered fire regimes and sea level rise, affecting its pine barren and sand dune habitats.[85] The species' limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it particularly susceptible to these threats.[29] Pilophorus fibula (endangered, 2020) is threatened by habitat loss, alteration of hydrological regimes, recreational damage, and declining water quality.[86] The species is found in a limited number of locations, making it vulnerable to local extinctions.[29]\n\nGymnoderma insulare (endangered, 2014), primarily found in old-growth forests in Japan and Taiwan, faces threats from natural hazards like typhoons and is affected by the decline of its tree hosts, Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa.[87] The species' dependence on specific host trees and old-growth forest conditions makes it particularly vulnerable to forest degradation and climate change impacts.[29]\n\nOn the red list of China's macrofungi, Cladonia delavayi (vulnerable), Cladonia pseudoevansii (critically endangered), Gymnoderma coccocarpum (endangered), and Gymnoderma insulare (endangered) are the representatives of the Cladoniaceae.[88]\n\nCladonia lichens, particularly the \"reindeer lichens\" such as C. stellaris, C. rangiferina, and C. arbuscula, are a critical winter food source for reindeer (caribou) in northern boreal and arctic regions.[89] In some areas, these lichens can constitute up to 80% of reindeer winter diet.[90] The average annual linear growth rate of these reindeer lichens is about 5 mm per year, accounting for their slow recovery rate after grazing or disturbance.[91] Satellite-based studies have shown a significant decline in caribou lichen cover across large areas of Eastern Canada over the past three decades, likely due to factors such as climate change-induced shrub encroachment, increased wildfire frequency, and grazing pressure, which could have serious implications for caribou populations and ecosystem dynamics.[92] The abundance of lichen-rich forests has significant economic implications for reindeer husbandry, particularly for indigenous Sámi people in Fennoscandia.[93] However, lichen-dominated forests have declined significantly in recent decades due to factors such as intensive forestry practices, overgrazing, and fire suppression.[93] This decline has prompted efforts to restore lichen habitats, including experimental transplantation of lichen fragments to accelerate recovery after disturbances like forest fires.[94]\n\nSome Cladoniaceae species are exploited in a profitable export business for decorative uses,[95] with demand reaching thousands of kilograms. In Europe, Cladonia stellaris is used ornamentally in wreaths, floral decorations and architectural models. From 1970–1975, an average of nearly 3000 metric tonnes were exported each year from Finland, Norway and Sweden; most of these exports (about 80%) went to West Germany.[96] Fruticose Cladonia species, often dyed green and glycerol-treated for flexibility, are common in model train displays as miniature trees and shrubs.[97] The product commercially sold as \"ball moss\" or \"Icelandic moss\" in hobby and craft stores is often Cladonia stellaris and other similar species, often dyed in various colours. In Sweden, Cladonia lichens were used historically as a partial insulation for storm windows.[99]\n\nThe complex net-like structures of the Australasian lichen Pulchrocladia retipora have been described as \"of considerable beauty resembling lace or coral\", and have been utilised in floral and architectural design.[100] This species' branches, characterised by its numerous small holes, exemplify nature's efficient use of latticework structures. This design, widely used in construction for structures such as transmission towers or bridges, allows the organism to maintain structural integrity while minimising the amount of biological material used in its construction. The unique lichen architectures of five Cladoniaceae species are depicted in Ernst Haeckel's well-known and widely reproduced lichen-themed lithograph in his 1904 work Kunstformen der Nature (The art forms of nature). According to the lichenologists Robert Lücking and Toby Spribille, \"the Cladonia growth form continues to be one of the most widely recognized lichen architectures, with their basal scales and erect, often trumpet-shaped podetia\".Cladoniaceae | NatureSpot: Lichens are hard to classify as they are composite organisms where an algae (or cyanobacteria in some cases) lives within a fungal structure.

American filmmaker, writer, actor, and artist. He rose to fame in the early 1970s for his transgressive cult films, including Multiple Maniacs (1970), Pink Flamingos (1972) and Female Trouble (1974). Waters wrote and directed the comedy film Hairspray (1988), which was later adapted into a hit Broadway musical and a 2007 musical film. Other films he has written and directed include Desperate Living (1977), Polyester (1981), Cry-Baby (1990), Serial Mom (1994), Pecker (1998), and Cecil B. Demented (2000). His films contain elements of post-modern comedy and surrealism.\n\nAs an actor, Waters has appeared in the films Sweet and Lowdown (1999), Mangus! (2011), Excision (2012), and Suburban Gothic (2014), as well as the Child's Play franchise with the film Seed of Chucky (2004) and the third season of the television series Chucky (2024). He hosted and produced the television series John Waters Presents Movies That Will Corrupt You (2006). Throughout his career, Waters often collaborated with actor and drag queen Divine and his regular cast of the Dreamlanders.[1] More recently, he performs in his touring one-man show This Filthy World.\n\nWaters also works as a visual artist and across different media, such as installations, photography, and sculpture. The audiobooks he narrated for his books Carsick and Mr. Know-It-All were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2015 and 2020, respectively.[2] In 2018, Waters was named an officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in France.[3] He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2023.[4]\n\nWaters was born on April 22, 1946, in Baltimore, Maryland, one of four children born to Patricia Ann (née Whitaker) and John Samuel Waters, a manufacturer of fire-protection equipment.[5] He was raised Catholic by his mother, though his father was not Catholic. Through his mother, who immigrated to the United States from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, as a child, he is the third-great-grandson of George P. Whitaker of the Whitaker iron family.[5][7] Waters grew up in Lutherville, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore. His boyhood friend and muse, Glenn Milstead, later known as Divine, also lived in Lutherville.[8] Waters lived at 313 Morris Avenue in Lutherville from his early teenage years until he moved out in his early twenties. Waters and Milstead shot many of their early films at the house, dubbing the front lawn the \"Dreamland Lot\".[9]\n\nThe film Lili inspired an interest in puppets in the seven-year-old Waters, who proceeded to stage violent versions of Punch and Judy for children's birthday parties. Biographer Robrt L. Pela says that Waters's mother believes the puppets in Lili had the greatest influence on Waters's subsequent career (though Pela believes tacky films at a local drive-in, which the young Waters watched from a distance through binoculars, had a greater effect).[10]\n\nCry-Baby was also a product of Waters's boyhood, because of his fascination as a seven-year-old with the \"drapes\" then receiving intense news coverage because of the murder of Carolyn Wasilewski, a young \"drapette\", and his admiration for a young man living across the street who had a hot rod.[11][12] Waters was privately educated at the Calvert School in Baltimore. After attending Towson Jr. High School in nearby Towson,[13] and Calvert Hall College High School, he graduated from Boys' Latin School of Maryland.[14] While still a teen, he made frequent trips into downtown Baltimore to visit Martick's, a beatnik bar, where he and Milstead met many of their later film collaborators.[15] He was underage and could not enter the bar proper, but loitered in the adjacent alley, where he relied on older patrons to slip him drinks.[16]\n\nWaters's first short film was Hag in a Black Leather Jacket.[17] MGM's The Wizard of Oz (1939) had a profound effect on Waters' creative mind. He said about it:\n\nWaters has stated that he takes an equal amount of joy and influence from high-brow \"art\" films and sleazy exploitation films.[19] In January 1966, Waters and some friends were caught smoking marijuana on the grounds of New York University, and he was soon kicked out of his dormitory. He returned to Baltimore, where he completed his next two short films, Roman Candles and Eat Your Makeup. They were followed by the feature-length films Mondo Trasho and Multiple Maniacs.[20]\n\nWaters's films became Divine's primary star vehicles. All of Waters's early films were shot in the Baltimore area with his company of local actors, the Dreamlanders—which, in addition to Divine, included Mink Stole, Cookie Mueller, Edith Massey, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce, Susan Walsh, and others. Waters met Edith Massey while she was a bartender at Pete's Hotel.[21] Waters's early campy movies present exaggerated characters in outrageous situations with hyperbolic dialogue. Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Desperate Living, which he labeled the Trash Trilogy, pushed hard at the boundaries of conventional propriety and censorship.\n\nWaters's 1981 film Polyester starred Divine opposite former teen idol Tab Hunter.[22] It was the first time that Waters was not the primary camera operator for his own work, as he had started collaborating with local film student David Insley.[23][24] Since then, his films have become less controversial and more mainstream, although works such as Hairspray, Cry-Baby, Serial Mom, Pecker and Cecil B. Demented still retain his trademark inventiveness. Hairspray became a hit Broadway musical that swept the 2003 Tony Awards;[25] and a film adaptation of the Broadway musical was released in theaters on July 20, 2007, to positive reviews and commercial success.[26] Cry-Baby, itself a musical, also became a Broadway musical.[27]\n\nIn 2004, the NC-17-rated A Dirty Shame marked a return to Waters' earlier, more controversial work of the 1970s. Having received mixed reviews and bombing at the box-office, it is his last film so far. In 2007, Waters became the host (\"The Groom Reaper\") of 'Til Death Do Us Part, a program on America's Court TV network. In 2008, he planned to make a children's Christmas film, Fruitcake[28] starring Johnny Knoxville and Parker Posey.[29] Filming was set for November 2008,[30] but the project was shelved in January 2009.[31]\n\nWaters has been open about financing problems for his movies. In 2010, Waters told the Chicago Tribune that \"Independent films that cost $5 million are very hard to get made. I sold the idea, got a development deal, got paid a great salary to write it—and now the company is no longer around, which is the case with many independent film companies these days.\"[32] In 2017, he stated that \"they all want you to make a movie for under a million dollars, which I don’t want to. I don’t want to be a faux radical film-maker at 70. I did that. I don’t need to do it again.\"[33]\n\nIn October 2022, it was announced that Waters will adapt his novel, Liarmouth, into a film. Village Roadshow Pictures was set to produce, with Waters writing and directing.[34] However, in November 2024, it was reported that the film was \"no longer happening\".[35]\n\nWaters has often created characters with alliterated names for his films, such as Corny Collins, Cuddles Kovinsky, Donald and Donna Dasher, Dawn Davenport, Fat Fuck Frank, Francine Fishpaw, Link Larkin, Motormouth Maybelle, Mole McHenry, Penny and Prudy Pingleton, Ramona Ricketts, Sandy Sandstone, Sylvia Stickles, Todd Tomorrow, Tracy Turnblad, Ursula Udders, Wade Walker and Wanda Woodward.[36]\n\nOn September 18, 2023, Waters was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Dreamlanders Ricki Lake and Mink Stole were among the guest speakers.[37]\n\nWaters is a bibliophile, with a collection of over 8,000 books. In 2011, during a visit to the Waters house in Baltimore, Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson observed:\n\nWaters has had his fan mail delivered to Atomic Books, an independent bookstore in Baltimore, for over 20 years.[39] Puffing constantly on a cigarette, Waters appeared in a short film, shown in film art houses, announcing that \"no smoking is permitted\" in the theaters. The spot was directed by Douglas Brian Martin and produced by Douglas Brian Martin and Steven M. Martin. They also created two other short films, for the Nuart Theatre (a Landmark Theater) in West Los Angeles, California, in appreciation for their showing Pink Flamingos for many years. It is shown immediately before any of Waters' films, and before the midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Waters played a minister in Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat, directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis.[40]\n\nIn the 1980s, Waters taught inmates at the Patuxent Institution, a Maryland prison. He was hired to teach literature, but his classes also encompassed discussions of film.[41][42] In 1985, he made a film with his students called Reckless Eyeballs, but it was not intended for release and was never publicly screened.[41]\n\nWaters is a board member of the Maryland Film Festival, and has selected and hosted a favorite film there each year since its launch in 1999.[43] He is also on the advisory board of the Provincetown International Film Festival, and has hosted events and presented awards there every year since it was founded in 1999.[44][45] He is a contributor to Artforum magazine and author of its year-end Top Ten Films list.[46] Waters hosts an annual performance, \"A John Waters Christmas\", which was launched in 1996 at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, and in 2018 toured 17 cities over 23 days.[47]\n\nIn 2017, Waters began hosting an annual \"Camp John Waters\" event in Kent, Connecticut. Adult fans from as far away as Australia and Chile \"relive their sleepaway camping days\" with an \"extra-campy theme weekend\".[48] Notable guests have included Debbie Harry, Patricia Hearst, Kathleen Turner, Mink Stole and Randy Harrison.[49][50] In 2019, the Film Society of Lincoln Center celebrated its 50th anniversary at a gala where John Waters spoke in tribute to the Center along with Martin Scorsese, Dee Rees, Pedro Almodóvar, Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Moore, Paul Dano and Zoe Kazan.[51]\n\nSince the early 1990s, Waters has been making photo-based artwork and installations that have been internationally exhibited in galleries and museums. In 2004, the New Museum in New York City presented a retrospective of his artwork curated by Marvin Heiferman and Lisa Phillips. His most recent exhibition John Waters: Indecent Exposure was exhibited at the Baltimore Museum of Art from October 2018 to January 2019 and later traveled to the Wexner Center for the Arts.[52][53] Prior to that, Waters exhibited Rear Projection in April 2009, at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York and the Gagosian Gallery in Los Angeles.[54] Waters has been represented by C. Grimaldis Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, since 2002 and by Marianne Boesky Gallery in New York since 2006.[55][56]\n\nWaters's pieces are often comical, such as Rush (2009), a super-sized, tipped-over bottle of poppers (nitrite inhalants), and Hardy Har (2006), a photograph of flowers that squirts water at anyone who traverses a taped line on the floor. Waters has characterized his art as conceptual: \"The craft is not the issue here. The idea is. And the presentation.\"[57]\n\nIn November 2020, Waters promised to donate 372 artworks from his personal collection, including some of his own work as well as pieces by 125 artists, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Cy Twombly, Cindy Sherman and more, to the Baltimore Museum of Art. In recognition of the donation, the museum named its rotunda after Waters, but Waters also insisted the museum name an all-gender bathroom after him.[58] Both the rotunda and the bathroom were renamed for Waters in time for the opening of the first exhibition of his bequeathed collection, Coming Attractions: The John Waters Collection on November 20, 2022.[59] Waters, who serves on the museum's board of directors, has stated the museum will acquire all of his art after his death.[60]\n\nWith the motif \"My life is so over-scheduled, what will happen if I give up control?\", Waters completed a hitchhiking journey across the United States from Baltimore to San Francisco, turning his adventures into a book titled Carsick.[61] On May 15, 2012, while on the hitchhiking trip, Waters was picked up by 20-year-old Myersville, Maryland, councilman Brett Bidle, who thought Waters was a homeless hitchhiker standing in the pouring rain. Feeling bad for Waters, he agreed to drive him four hours to Ohio.[62]\n\nThe next day, indie rock band Here We Go Magic tweeted that they had picked John Waters up hitchhiking in Ohio. He was wearing a hat with the text \"Scum of the Earth\".[63] In Denver, Colorado, Waters reconnected with Bidle (who had made an effort to catch up with him); Bidle then drove him another 1,000 miles (1,600 km) to Reno, Nevada. Before parting ways, Waters arranged for Bidle to stay at his San Francisco apartment: \"I thought, you know what, he wanted an adventure, too ... He's the first Republican I'd ever vote for.\"[61]\n\nBidle later said: \"We are polar opposites when it comes to our politics, religious beliefs. But that's what I loved about the whole trip. It was two people able to agree to disagree and still move on and have a great time. I think that's what America's all about.\"[61]\n\nAlthough he has maintained apartments in New York City and San Francisco's Nob Hill, as well as a summer home in Provincetown,[47] Waters mainly resides in Baltimore.[64][65] All his films are set and shot there.[66] He is recognizable by his trademark pencil moustache.[64]\n\nAs a gay man, Waters is an avid supporter of gay rights and gay pride.[67] In a 2019 interview, he said that he dislikes publicly discussing his personal life, adding that he had a partner but that they both preferred to keep the relationship private.[68]\n\nWaters was a great fan of the music of Little Richard when growing up. He has said that, ever since he shoplifted a copy of the Little Richard song \"Lucille\" in 1957, at the age of 11, \"I've wished I could somehow climb into Little Richard's body, hook up his heart and vocal cords to my own, and switch identities.\" In 1987, Playboy magazine employed Waters, then aged 41, to interview his idol, but the interview did not go well, with Waters later remarking: \"It turned into kind of a disaster.\"[69]\n\nWaters advocated for the parole of former Manson family member Leslie Van Houten, writing in his 2010 book Role Models, \"Her crime was a long, long time ago and she has paid her dues to society\".[70][71][72][73] After Van Houten was paroled in 2023, Waters said he would not speak further about her, in deference to her privacy.[74]\n\nThroughout his life, Waters has been open about his recreational drug use, including marijuana and LSD, particularly with regard to his creative process. Waters began using LSD as a teenager, \"tak[ing] LSD and see[ing]...movies all the time\".[75] Waters was often on LSD while making his early films, claiming in a 2016 interview \"I was on LSD [during Multiple Maniacs], I don't remember [how long it took to shoot the film]!\"[76] He tried LSD again in his 70s, and documented the experience in his 2019 book Mr. Know-It-All.[77]\n\nWaters was a smoker before quitting around 2004, saying \"the only thing I've ever regretted in my whole life [was] smoking cigarettes. Because it was a nightmare giving up. It's the only thing the government ever told me that was true: It does kill you!\"[78] In 2022, Waters said that if he were to write his younger self a letter, he would say \"quit smoking [cigarettes] and do everything else\".[79]\n• This Filthy World – Waters's touring one-man show, made into a feature film directed by Jeff Garlin 137\n• The Little Mermaid Special Edition DVD (2006) – Interview on 'making of' documentary about Howard Ashman, the theatre (i.e. Little Shop of Horrors), and the inspiration behind the character Ursula: Divine\n• Breaking Up with John Waters – Waters's third CD compilation rumored as \"currently in the works\" in 2004 141\n• The Other Hollywood – Commentary and opinions about pornography throughout the book 142\n• \"The Creep\" (featuring Nicki Minaj) – Appeared on a television set in The Lonely Island's music video \"The Creep\", which made its debut on Saturday Night Live.

If I ever got sentenced to prison I would have to because I wouldn’t have the proper tools to keep it. I don’t think they sell Maybelline eye line pencil in the prison commissary. I’d have to be like grinding down ashes and stuff from illegal cigarettes. I don’t think I’d go that far.\n\nHave you been to jail?\n\nOf course, for a night or something. I was never sentenced or anything, but I’ve been arrested. I don’t trust anyone that hasn’t been to jail at least once in their life. You should have been or something’s the matter with you.\n\nYou seem attracted by outcasts and criminals. Patty Hearst, who was convicted of bank robbery and later pardoned, appeared in your film Cry-Baby and you are friends with Leslie van Houten, who is still in prison today for her involvement in the Charles Manson murders. What is it about these people that you are drawn to?\n\nThey survived incredibly extreme situations. Way more than I ever have. That’s what Role Models was about, my book, just about people that have survived. Patty Hearst was great. Whatever she did, she did to stay alive. Even though she got life in prison, Leslie van Houten still tries to make herself a better person than she would have been if she hadn’t done that crime, which is all you really can do when you’ve done something that bad. Which is, to me, admirable and amazing. I don’t know if I’d be that brave.\n\nSome people say that the bad guys are really the good guys in your films.\n\nThey are! The good guys in my movies mind their own business and they don’t judge other people. And the bad guys are jealous, they judge other people without knowing the whole story, they want all the attention and they’re mean spirited. So yes, I think my films are politically correct in a weird way.\n\nCould you even say that your films are driven by a sense of social justice?\n\nYes. I think social justice is important. I think it’s not fair. Life is a rotten lottery. I’ve had a pretty amazing life, a good life, and God knows I’m thankful, but I do believe that after 30, stop whining! Everybody’s dealt a hand, and it’s not fair what you get. But you’ve got to deal with it. Stop blaming your parents. If you’re really angry at 60 years old, you’re an idiot! You’ve got to work some of it out. You can be angry at social issues. But the only way I’ve learned to change anyone’s mind politically is to make them laugh. My whole career has been about that.\n\nYour films aren’t just funny, they are also really weird. Whenever I watch your films I feel like I’m being a bit naughty.\n\nAw, that’s okay! That’s good! I think I invite you to come into a world that you might be uncomfortable with but if I’m your guide, then you feel safe. That’s all right. I’m a filth elder, I’m a good uncle. I’ll get you an abortion, take you to rehab. I think that I’m a good family member.\n\nMy brother wouldn’t let me watch Pink Flamingos growing up because of the scene where Divine eats dog shit.\n\nOh, but it was okay to watch artificial insemination? Or blow jobs between mother and son? Or chicken fucking? Your brother said that was the only scene? There was worse stuff! (Laughs)\n\nA lot of your films have included similarly revolting scenes. Was it important for you to be subversive or transgressive with your work?\n\nTransgressive was too highfalutin a word, really. But certainly I’m flattered when… At first, when I was young, I was called pernicious. I didn’t know what that meant, so I looked it up and you can never be called anything as scary as that! So, everything afterwards was a let down after I was called pernicious.\n\nYour dad loaned you money to help finance your early films, but is it true that he never saw them?\n\nOf course he didn’t. Why would I make my father watch Multiple Maniacs? Those movies were made to horrify parents. My parents knew what they were, they read about them in the paper and stuff. My mother came to Mondo Trasho and she said, “You’re going to die, end up in a mental institution, commit suicide, or OD,” and I said, “Oh, you liked it?” (Laughs) But they grew to understand it. What parent would be happy – like Divine’s mother – what mother would be happy that their son is in drag eating dog shit? Really, no parent’s that liberal.\n\nBut that style is what made you into a cult filmmaker.\n\nWell cult is a word you would never say in Hollywood. Cult means that it lost money and three smart people liked it. In any film business, if you’re trying to get your next film made, you would never say, “Oh, my last film was a cult film.” I’d say, “Oh great, well I hope this one isn’t!” I always say to Johnny Knoxville, “How do you do it? You sort of do the same thing we did, except you made millions and I made hundreds.” (Laughs) Johnny Knoxville would eat dog shit. If we hadn’t done it, he would’ve done it.\n\nI remember watching the first Jackass movie in a very blue-collar neighborhood in Baltimore and there were these blue-collar fathers and their butch, heterosexual sons watching and enjoying men putting toy cars up their asses – and they’re bonding over this. And I thought, “That’s great.” He has a gift, you see, that he can do this. He just sent me a good present in the mail last week, a real product called anal bleach. I wanted to take it to California to show it to a friend this Thursday, but I can’t because if they find that in my luggage at the security, I’ll be so embarrassed! Nobody would believe me that it was a joke. I don’t want to go through the airport and explain what my anal bleach is.\n\nYou don’t mind explaining all the weird stuff in your films?\n\nThat’s in my movies! This is in my real life.\n\nIs it easier to talk about your movies than your real life?\n\nWell, I have to talk about my movies. I have to give interviews to promote what I’m doing. But no one really knows my personal life. And if you don’t have a personal life I feel bad for you. That’s the reason why if I go out for dinner with you and it’s not tax deductible it’s a compliment really. Not every meal is about business. I definitely have a great personal life, actually. I always feel bad when I meet celebrities and I can just tell every single thing about their personal life, I just say, “Well, they don’t have friends. Or a therapist.” Once you have both, you don’t have to share everything with people, because then you don’t have a private life, and then you’re, I guess, a workaholic.Unscramble FILMEAN: F I L M E A N Letter Values in Word Scrabble and Words With Friends Here are the values for the letters F I L M E A N in two of the most popular word scramble games.

The band was active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.[2]\n\nTheir first single, \"Sultans of Swing\", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by a series of hit singles including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1981), \"Private Investigations\" (1982), \"Twisting by the Pool\" (1983), \"Money for Nothing\" (1985), and \"Walk of Life\" (1985).[3] Their most commercially successful album, Brothers in Arms (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide; it was the first album to sell a million copies on CD[4][5] and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK history. According to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, as of 2005, Dire Straits had spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, the fifth-most at that time.[6]\n\nDire Straits drew from influences including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz.[7] Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who remained with the band for its entire history.[8] After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told Rolling Stone: \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\"[9] They disbanded permanently in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has declined numerous reunion offers,[10] and confirmed in April 2024 that he would never play as part of the group again.[11]\n\nDire Straits were called \"the biggest British rock band of the 80s\" by Classic Rock magazine;[12] their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia.[13] Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (including Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards.[14] They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold between 100 million and 120 million records worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[15][16]\n\nBrothers Mark and David Knopfler were born in Glasgow[17] and raised in Blyth in the northeast of England. With John Illsley and Pick Withers, from Leicester in the East Midlands, they formed Dire Straits in Deptford, south east London,[18] in 1977.[19] Withers was already a 10-year music business veteran, having been a session drummer for Dave Edmunds, Gerry Rafferty, Magna Carta and others through the 1970s. He was house drummer at Rockfield Studios in Monmouthshire[20] and was part of the group Spring, which recorded an album for RCA in 1971. At the time of the band's formation, Mark was working as an English teacher,[21] Illsley was studying at Goldsmiths' College, and David was a social worker.[22] Mark and Withers had both been part of the pub rock group Brewers Droop around 1973.[23]\n\nThe new band was initially known as the Café Racers. The name Dire Straits was coined by a musician flatmate of Withers, allegedly thought up while they were rehearsing in the kitchen of a friend, Simon Cowe, of Lindisfarne. In 1977, the group recorded a five-song demo tape which included their future hit single, \"Sultans of Swing\", as well as \"Water of Love\" and \"Down to the Waterline\".[24][25] After a performance at the Rock Garden in 1977, they took a demo tape to MCA in Soho but were turned down. They sent a tape to DJ Charlie Gillett, presenter of Honky Tonk on BBC Radio London.[26] The band simply wanted advice, but Gillett liked the music so much that he played \"Sultans of Swing\" on his show. Two months later, Dire Straits signed a recording contract with the Vertigo division of Phonogram Inc. In October 1977, the band recorded demo tapes of \"Southbound Again\", \"In the Gallery\" and \"Six Blade Knife\" for BBC Radio London; in November, demo tapes were made of \"Setting Me Up\", \"Eastbound Train\" and \"Real Girl\".[26]\n\nThe group's first album, Dire Straits, was recorded at Basing Street studios in Notting Hill, London in February 1978, at a cost of £12,500.[27] Produced by Muff Winwood, it was first released in the United Kingdom on Vertigo Records, then a division of Phonogram Inc. It came to the attention of A&R representative Karin Berg, working at Warner Bros. Records in New York City. She felt that it was the kind of music audiences were hungry for, but only one person in her department agreed at first.[27] Many of the songs on the album reflected Mark Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds and London. \"Down to the Waterline\" recalled images of life in Newcastle; \"In the Gallery\" is a tribute to Leeds sculptor/artist Harry Phillips (father of Steve Phillips); \"Wild West End\" and \"Lions\" were drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.[28][29]\n\nThat year, Dire Straits began a tour as opening band for Talking Heads, after the re-released \"Sultans of Swing\" finally started to climb the UK charts.[30] This led to a United States recording contract with Warner Bros. Records; before the end of 1978, Dire Straits had released their self-titled debut worldwide. They received more attention in the US, but also arrived at the top of the charts in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Dire Straits eventually went top 10 in every European country.\n\nThe following year, Dire Straits embarked on their first North American tour. They played 51 sold-out concerts over a 38-day period.[31] \"Sultans of Swing\" scaled the charts to No. 4 in the US and No. 8 in the United Kingdom.[30][32] The song was one of Dire Straits' biggest hits and became a fixture in the band's live performances. Bob Dylan, who had seen the band play in Los Angeles, was so impressed that he invited Mark Knopfler and drummer Pick Withers to play on his next album, Slow Train Coming.[33]\n\nRecording sessions for the group's second album, Communiqué, took place in December 1978 at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas. Released in June 1979, Communiqué was produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett and went to No. 1 on the German album charts, with the debut album Dire Straits simultaneously at No. 3. In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at No. 5 in the album charts. Featuring the single \"Lady Writer\", the second album continued in a similar vein to the first and displayed the expanding scope of Knopfler's lyricism on the opening track, \"Once Upon a Time in the West\".[34] In the coming year, however, this approach began to change, along with the group's line-up.\n\nIn 1980, Dire Straits were nominated for two Grammy Awards for Best New Artist and Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for \"Sultans of Swing\".[35] In July 1980, the band started recording tracks for their third album. Produced by Jimmy Iovine, with Mark Knopfler also sharing credit, Making Movies was released in October 1980. During the recording sessions, tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career.[36] The remaining trio continued the album, with a session guitarist Sid McGinnis on rhythm guitar, although he was uncredited on the album, and Roy Bittan from Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band guesting on keyboards. After the recording sessions were completed, keyboardist Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joined Dire Straits as full-time members for the On Location tour of Europe, North America, and Oceania.[27]\n\nMaking Movies received mostly positive reviews and featured longer songs with more complex arrangements, a style which would continue for the rest of the band's career. The album featured many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions. The most successful chart single was \"Romeo and Juliet\" (number 8 in the UK Singles Chart), a song about a failed love affair, with Knopfler's trademark in keeping personal songs under fictitious names.[37] Although never released as a hit single, \"Solid Rock\" was featured in all Dire Straits' live shows from this point on for the remainder of their career, while the album's lengthy opening track, \"Tunnel of Love\", with its intro \"The Carousel Waltz\" by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, was featured in the 1982 Richard Gere film An Officer and a Gentleman. Although \"Tunnel of Love\" reached only no. 54 in the UK when released as a single in 1981, it remains one of Dire Straits' most famous and popular songs and immediately became a favourite live staple, entering the band’s concert repertoire from this point onwards. Making Movies stayed in the UK Albums Chart for five years, peaking at No. 4.[38] Rolling Stone ranked Making Movies number 52 on its list of the \"100 Best Albums of the Eighties\".[39]\n\nDire Straits' fourth studio album Love Over Gold, an album of songs filled with lengthy passages that featured Alan Clark's piano and keyboard work, was well received when it was released in September 1982, going gold in America and spending four weeks at number one in the United Kingdom. The title was inspired by graffiti seen from the window of Knopfler's old council flat in London. The phrase was taken from the sleeve of an album by Captain Beefheart. Love Over Gold was the first Dire Straits album produced solely by Mark Knopfler, and its main chart hit, \"Private Investigations\", gave Dire Straits their first top 5 hit single in the United Kingdom, where it reached the number 2 position, despite its almost seven-minute length, and became another of the band's most popular live songs.[40]\n\nIn other parts of the world, \"Industrial Disease\", a song that looks at the decline of the British manufacturing industry in the early 1980s, focusing on strikes, depression and dysfunctionality, was the main single from the album, particularly in Canada, where it became a top 10 hit. As well as the title track and \"It Never Rains\", Love Over Gold featured the 14-minute epic \"Telegraph Road\". Also written by Knopfler during this period was \"Private Dancer\", which did not appear on the album, but was eventually given to Tina Turner for her comeback album of the same name. Love Over Gold reportedly sold two million copies during the first six weeks after its release. Shortly after the release of Love Over Gold, drummer Pick Withers left the band. His replacement was Terry Williams, formerly of Rockpile and a range of other Welsh bands, including Man.[41]\n\nIn January 1983, a four-song EP titled ExtendedancEPlay was released while Love Over Gold was still in the album charts. It featured the hit single \"Twisting By the Pool\", which reached the Top 20 in the UK and Canada. The band won Best British Group at the 1983 Brit Awards.[42] Dire Straits embarked on an eight-month-long Love over Gold Tour, which finished with two concerts at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 22 and 23 July 1983. King Crimson saxophonist Mel Collins and session keyboardist Tommy Mandel, who had played with Bryan Adams since 1981, joined the live line-up to help Clark cover his increasingly detailed keyboard parts and arrangements. The double album Alchemy Live was a recording of excerpts from the final two concerts and was reportedly released without studio overdubs. It was released in March 1984, reaching the Top 3 in the UK Albums Chart.[43]\n\nDuring 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits, some of which other band members contributed towards. Knopfler and Terry Williams contributed to Phil Everly´s and Cliff Richard´s UK hit single \"She Means Nothing To Me\", released in early 1983, and Knopfler had also expressed his interest writing film music, and after producer David Puttnam responded[44][45] he wrote and produced the music score to the film Local Hero. The album was released in April 1983[46] and received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Film Music the following year.[47] Alan Clark contributed significantly, and other Dire Straits members Illsley, Lindes and Williams played on one track, \"Freeway Flyer\", while Gerry Rafferty sang lead vocals on \"The Way It Always Starts\".[48] The closing track on the album and played during the credits in the film is the instrumental \"Going Home: Theme of the Local Hero\" which was released as a single, and remains very popular among football fans, especially those of Knopfler’s home town club, Newcastle United, as it is played as the team runs out before every home game.[49] The track immediately became a popular live staple for Dire Straits, entering the band's repertoire from 1983 onwards.[50][51]\n\n\"Local Hero\" was followed in 1984 by Cal, which was also released on album and to which John Illsley and Terry Williams contributed, and Comfort and Joy, which also featured contributions from Williams. Also, during this time Knopfler produced Bob Dylan's Infidels which also featured Alan Clark, as well as albums for Aztec Camera and Willy DeVille. Also in 1984, John Illsley released his first solo album, Never Told a Soul, to which Knopfler, Clark and Williams all contributed.[52] Knopfler also teamed up with Bryan Ferry to contribute lead guitar to one track from his solo album Boys and Girls, released in June 1985.\n\nDire Straits returned to recording at the end of 1984 and began recording tracks at George Martin's AIR Studios in Montserrat for their upcoming fifth studio album, to be titled Brothers in Arms, with Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman producing.[53] The recording sessions saw further personnel changes. Taking the place of Tommy Mandel, Guy Fletcher, who had previously worked as a session musician with Roxy Music and had worked with Knopfler on the Cal and Comfort and Joy soundtracks, joined Dire Straits full time so that the band had a permanent second keyboardist.[27] Hal Lindes left the band early on during the recording sessions and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni, a New York-based guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler (although Sonni's contribution to the album was minimal).[54]\n\nAccording to a Sound on Sound magazine interview with Neil Dorfsman, the drumming style of Terry Williams was considered to be unsuitable for the desired sound of the album during the first month of the recording sessions at Montserrat.[55] Williams was released from the recording sessions and temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded the album's drum parts within three days before leaving for other commitments.[56] Both Hakim and Williams are credited on the album,[57] although Williams’ sole contribution on the finished album was the improvised crescendo at the beginning of \"Money for Nothing\". According to another interview with Neil Dorsman, Williams played toms and tom fills throughout \"Money for Nothing\", while Omar Hakim played drums on all the remaining tracks on the album.[58] According to Williams, he recorded all his drum parts to a click track which he felt hindered his ability to channel the rhythmic feel he wanted. Around six weeks after the recording sessions started, Williams voiced his disappointment to Mark Knopfler over some of his playing so far after listening to a playback of what was recorded; shortly after this, he was dismissed from the sessions.[59] Williams would however be back in the band as a full time member for the music videos and the 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour that followed.[57]\n\nReleased in May 1985, Brothers in Arms entered the UK Albums Chart at number 1 and spent a total of 228 weeks in the charts[60] and sold over 4.3 million copies.[61] It went on to become the best-selling album of 1985 in the UK.[30] Brothers in Arms was similarly successful in the US, peaking at No. 1 on Billboard 200 for nine weeks, going multi-platinum and selling nine million copies there.[35][62] The album spent 34 weeks at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts, and it remains the longest-running number one album in Australia.[63]\n\nThe album featured a more lavish production and overall sound than Dire Straits' earlier work and spawned several big chart singles: \"Money for Nothing\", which reached number 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and number 4 in the UK Singles Chart, \"So Far Away\" (No. 20 UK, No. 19 US), \"Brothers in Arms\" (No. 16 UK), \"Walk of Life\" (No. 2 UK, No. 7 US), and \"Your Latest Trick\" (No. 26 UK).[35] \"Money for Nothing\" was the first video to be played on MTV in the UK and featured guest vocals by Sting, who is credited with co-writing the song with Mark Knopfler, although it was the inclusion of the melody from \"Don't Stand So Close To Me\" that triggered the copyright credit, as no actual lyrics were written by Sting. It also won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in February 1986.[64]\n\nBrothers in Arms was the first album recorded entirely digitally, because of Knopfler pushing for improved sound quality.[65][66] Written during Britain's involvement in the Falklands War of 1982, the album's title track, \"Brothers in Arms\", deals with the senselessness of war.[53][67] In 2007, the 25th anniversary of the war, Knopfler recorded a new version of the song at Abbey Road Studios to raise funds for British veterans who he said \"are still suffering from the effects of that conflict.\"[68] \"Brothers in Arms\" has become a favourite at military funerals.[69] Reported to be the world's first CD single, it was issued in the UK as a promotional item distinguished with a logo for the tour, Live in '85, while a second to commemorate the Australian leg of the tour marked Live in '86.[70] \"Walk of Life\", meanwhile, was nearly excluded from the album when co-producer Neil Dorfsman voted against its inclusion, but the band members out-voted him. The result was Dire Straits' most commercially successful hit single in the UK, peaking at number two.[30]\n\nThe album is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the first compact disc (CD) to sell a million copies,[71] and it has been credited with popularising the CD format.[65][72] The Guardian ranked the Brothers in Arms CD number 38 in their list of the 50 key events in rock music history.[65] The album featured the full version of the \"Money for Nothing\" cut, rather than the LP version, and it also includes extended versions of all tracks on the first side of the LP, with the exception of \"Walk of Life\".[73]\n\nThe 1985–1986 Brothers in Arms world tour which followed the album's release was phenomenally successful, with over 2.5 million tickets sold.[74] The tour included dates in Europe, Israel, North America, and Australia and New Zealand. The band, joined by saxophonist Chris White, played 248 shows in over 100 different cities.[75] The tour began on 25 April 1985 in Split, Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia). While playing a 13-night residency at Wembley Arena in London, the band moved down the road to Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of 13 July 1985, to appear in a Live Aid slot,[76] in which their set included \"Money For Nothing\" with Sting as guest vocalist. John Illsley states, \"It was a very special feeling to be part of something so unique. Live Aid was a unique privilege for all of us. It’s become a fabulous memory.\"[77] The tour ended at the Sydney Entertainment Centre, Australia, on 26 April 1986, where Dire Straits still holds the record for consecutive appearances at 21 nights.[78] The band also made an impromptu attempt at the Australian folk song \"Waltzing Matilda\". With 900,000 tickets sold in Australia and New Zealand, it was the biggest concert tour in Australasian music history, until it was overtaken in 2017–2018 by Ed Sheeran.[79]\n\nAdditionally, in 1985, a group that set out from London to Khartoum to raise money for famine relief, led by John Abbey, was called \"The Walk of Life\". Dire Straits donated the Brothers in Arms Gold disc to the participants in recognition of what they were doing. The band's concert of 10 July 1985 at Wembley Arena, in which they were accompanied by Nils Lofgren for \"Solid Rock\" and Hank Marvin joined the band at the end to play \"Going Home\" (the theme from Local Hero), was televised in the United Kingdom on The Tube on Channel 4 in January 1986.[80] (Although never officially released, bootleg recordings of the performance entitled Wembley does the Walk (2005) have been circulated.)\n\nIn 1986, Brothers in Arms won two Grammy Awards and also won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards.[64][81] Q magazine placed the album at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever in 2000.[82] The album also ranked number 351 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2003.[83] Brothers in Arms is also ranked number 3 in the best albums of 1985 and number 31 in the best albums of the 1980s, and as of December 2017, the album was ranked the eighth-best-selling album in UK chart history, and is the 107th-best-selling album in the United States.[84] In August 1986, MTV Europe was launched with Dire Straits' \"Money for Nothing\".[85]\n\nAfter the Brothers in Arms tour ended, Mark Knopfler took a break from Dire Straits, and, during 1987, he concentrated on solo projects and film soundtracks. Dire Straits regrouped in 1988 for the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert, staged on 11 June 1988 at Wembley Stadium, in which they were the headline act. Guitarist Jack Sonni was unable to play the show as it coincided with the birth of his twin daughters, so Eric Clapton played rhythm guitar with the band, and during the set performed his hit \"Wonderful Tonight\" with them.[86][87] Sonni and Terry Williams both officially left the band shortly afterwards.[88]\n\nMark Knopfler announced the dissolution of Dire Straits in September 1988. He told Rob Tannenbaum in Rolling Stone: \"A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest.\"[89] The tremendous success of the Brothers in Arms album and the tour that went with it left the band members under a significant amount of stress, and Knopfler announced that he wanted to work on more personal projects. A best of / greatest hits compilation, Money for Nothing, was released in October 1988 and reached number one in the UK.[40] The group's first hit single \"Sultans of Swing\" was re-released as a single in the UK to promote the album.[90] Also in 1988, John Illsley released his second solo album, Glass, which featured Mark Knopfler, Alan Clark, Guy Fletcher and Chris White.[91] During this period, Alan Clark joined Eric Clapton's band for three years, during which time Knopfler also briefly joined.\n\nIn May 1989, Dire Straits reunited for a one off charity concert at the Mayfair Ballroom in Newcastle in honour of 11-year-old Joanne Gillespie – the National Children of Courage and North East Personality award winner who published the 1989 book Brave Heart about her fight against cancer. The concert raised more than £35,000. This was the last ever appearance by Terry Williams as the band’s drummer, and Brendan Croker played rhythm guitar in place of Jack Sonni.[92][93][94] Also in 1989 over a meal at a Notting Hill wine bar,[86] Knopfler formed the Notting Hillbillies, a country band featuring Guy Fletcher, Brendan Croker, and Steve Phillips, and their manager, Ed Bicknell on drums. The Notting Hillbillies' one album, Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time, with its single \"Your Own Sweet Way\", was released in March 1990. The Notting Hillbillies toured for the remainder of the year and appeared on Saturday Night Live. Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences on his 1990 collaboration with the guitarist Chet Atkins, Neck and Neck.[95]\n\nIn 1990, Dire Straits (Knopfler, Illsley, Clark and Fletcher), performed alongside Eric Clapton and his band at the Knebworth Festival, playing \"Solid Rock\", \"Money for Nothing\" and \"I Think I Love You Too Much\". Knopfler explained that the latter was an experimental song and was unsure if they should record it on a following record.[96] The song, a blues rock track with solos by Knopfler and Clapton, also appeared on the 1990 album Hell To Pay as a gift[97] to Canadian blues/jazz artist Jeff Healey from Knopfler. This was prior to the time that Knopfler, Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform the band the following year.[98]\n\nIn 1990, Dire Straits reunited. Retaining Bicknell as their manager, Mark Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher were joined in the studio by saxophonist Chris White, steel guitarist Paul Franklin, percussionist Danny Cummings and guitarist Phil Palmer, with drums split between Jeff Porcaro of Toto and Manu Katché.[98][99] The new album was produced by Knopfler, Clark and Fletcher.\n\nDire Straits released their sixth studio album, On Every Street, in September 1991, which turned out to be their final studio release. It was met with more moderate success and mixed reviews, as well as a significantly reduced audience. Some retrospective reviewers, including the All Music Guide,[100] dubbed On Every Street an \"underwhelming\" follow-up to Brothers in Arms. However, it had sold 15 million copies by 2008,[101] and on release, it went straight to number 1 in the UK Albums Chart.[102] The album also reached number 1 in numerous European countries and Australia, and was particularly successful in France, where it achieved Diamond certification. In the US, it peaked at number 12.[30][32]\n\nSeveral singles were released from the album, some of which achieved success in Europe, Australasia and the US; however, none were successful in the UK.[103] An edited version of the opening track \"Calling Elvis\" was the first single released from the album. With a video based on the 1960s television show Thunderbirds, the track charted at number 21 on its first week in the UK Singles Chart but dropped out of the charts within four weeks. The track fared much better elsewhere, however, reaching the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand and throughout Europe, peaking as high as the number 2 position in several countries, including Denmark and Switzerland, and number 1 in Italy.\n\nThe follow-up single, \"Heavy Fuel\", failed to reach the Top 50 in the UK Singles chart; however, it reached number one in the US on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart,[104] their second song to do so (after \"Money for Nothing\"). The track reached the top 20 in Canada and Belgium and peaked inside the top 30 in other European countries, as well as Australia. The album's title track was also relatively unsuccessful in the UK, failing to reach the top 40, although it reached the top 25 in France. The final single released in the UK was \"The Bug\", which reached the top 25 in Canada and contains backing vocals by Vince Gill, who was invited to join the band full-time but declined and pursued a solo career.[105] \"You and Your Friend\" was also released as a single in France and Germany, but not in the UK.\n\nDire Straits, with Chris Whitten on drums,[106] embarked on a world tour to promote the album, which lasted until October 1992. The On Every Street Tour featured 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans.[107] While musically more elaborate than the previous 1985–86 world tour, the band's gruelling final tour was not as critically acclaimed nor as commercially successful. This proved to be too much for Dire Straits, and by this time Mark Knopfler had enough of such massive operations. This led to the second and final break-up. Bill Flanagan described the sequence of events in GQ: \"The subsequent world tour lasted nearly two years, made mountains of money and drove Dire Straits into the ground. When the tour was over, both Knopfler's marriage and his band were gone.\"\n\nManager Ed Bicknell also said, \"The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the zeitgeist was that we had been part of, it had passed.\" John Illsley agreed, saying \"Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.\"[108] The last stop and final touring concert of the group took place on 9 October 1992 in Zaragoza, Spain.[109]\n\nAfter the end of the tour, Mark Knopfler expressed a wish to give up touring on a big scale and took some time out from the music business. A live album, On the Night, was released in May 1993, which documented the tour, again to very mixed reviews. Nevertheless, it reached the UK Top 5, a rare achievement for a live album.[30] The four track Encores EP was also released and rose to number one in the French and Spanish singles charts and reached number 31 in the UK.[110][111]\n\nDire Straits' final album, Live at the BBC, is a collection of live recordings from 1978 to 1981, which mostly feature the original line-up of the band.[112] Released in June 1995, their third and final live album was a contractual release to Vertigo Records (now a division of Mercury Records).[112] At this time, Mark Knopfler quietly disbanded Dire Straits and prepared to work on his first full-fledged solo album (still signed to Mercury Records).[113] Knopfler later recalled that, \"I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. It's self-protection, a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing.\"[114] Knopfler spent two years recovering from the experience, which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.\n\nAfter disbanding Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler started a career as a solo artist, releasing his first solo album, Golden Heart, in March 1996 after nearly 20 years of collaborations. Brothers in Arms was certified nine times platinum in the US in August 1996.[35] During that year, the entire Dire Straits catalogue was remastered by Bob Ludwig and re-released on CD on Mercury Records, in most of the world outside the US. The remasters were released in September 2000 in the US on Warner Bros.\n\nKnopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher reunited for one last time on 19 June 1999, with Ed Bicknell on drums, playing five songs, including Chuck Berry's \"Nadine\", for Illsley's wedding.[115] In July 2002, Knopfler was joined by Illsley, Fletcher, Danny Cummings and Chris White for four charity concerts under the name of \"Mark Knopfler and friends\".[116] Brendan Croker joined Knopfler during the first half, playing mainly material composed with The Notting Hillbillies. Illsley came on for a Dire Straits session toward the end of which, at a Shepherd's Bush concert, Jimmy Nail provided backing vocals for Knopfler's solo composition, \"Why Aye Man\". This song appeared on The Ragpicker's Dream (2002), an album that contained references to Knopfler's home area in the north east of England.[117]\n\nA compilation album, The Best of Dire Straits & Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations, was released in November 2005 and reached the UK Top 20. Featuring material from the majority of Dire Straits' studio albums and Knopfler's solo and soundtrack material, it was released in two editions, a single CD with a grey cover and a double CD in a blue cover. The only previously unreleased track on the album, \"All the Roadrunning\", was a duet with singer Emmylou Harris. The album was well received. In 2005, Brothers in Arms was re-released in a limited 20th anniversary edition which won a Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album at the 48th Grammy Awards ceremony.[118]\n\nSince the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in re-forming the band and is quoted as saying he was not interested in \"getting all that stuff back together again.\"[10] He said, \"I would only do that for a charity. I'm glad I've experienced it all – I had a lot of fun with it – but I like things the way they are.\" Keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost all of Knopfler's solo work to date and Danny Cummings has been a frequent contributor, notably to Knopfler's solo album releases All the Roadrunning (with Emmylou Harris), Kill to Get Crimson, Get Lucky and One Deep River.[119][120]\n\nIn 2007, Knopfler said he did not miss the global fame that came his way at the height of the band's success. He said, \"It just got too big.\"[10] In October 2008, Illsley told the BBC that he hoped Knopfler would agree to re-form Dire Straits for a comeback tour. Knopfler declined, saying that he was reluctant to re-form the group and that he was not \"a fan of Dire Straits' early hits.\"[121][122] In the same interview, Illsley said Knopfler was enjoying his continuing success as a solo artist. \"He's doing incredibly well as a solo artist, so hats off to him. He's having a perfectly good time doing what he's doing.\"[10] Guy Fletcher stated on his website that Knopfler had no interest in re-forming Dire Straits.[123]\n\nIn December 2009, the band were commemorated with a Heritage Award from PRS for Music. A plaque was placed on a block of flats in Deptford, London, where Dire Straits was formed and played their first gig.[124] In 2011, Alan Clark, Chris White, and Phil Palmer, along with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' drummer Steve Ferrone, formed a new band, the Straits, to perform at a charity show at the Royal Albert Hall in London.[125]\n\nOn 13 December 2017, Dire Straits were announced as inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for 2018.[126] Speaking to Billboard magazine, Illsley said he was pleased to have his work as a musician recognised,[109] but felt that Knopfler was not enthusiastic about a possible reunion performance. Knopfler did not appear at the ceremony.[127]\n\nIn 2009, Illsley and Clark performed several Dire Straits songs in an open air concert in San Vigilio, and since then, Clark, Palmer, Illsley, Cummings, Collins, Sonni and Withers, in various line-ups, have toured as the Dire Straits Legends and continue as the Dire Straits Legacy. They have released an album, 3 Chord Trick.[128] In a 2018 US tour they were joined by Trevor Horn on bass and Steve Ferrone on drums.[129]\n\nIn September 2021, Alan Clark released his piano solo album Backstory, and in November 2021 Illsley published his autobiography My Life in Dire Straits. Former Straits guitarist Jack Sonni died on 30 August 2023 at the age of 68.[130]\n\nIn November 2023, Illsley reiterated in an interview that he and Knopfler had no interest in reforming Dire Straits, in spite of having received large financial offers to get back together. He reflected that the band members had \"reached the end of the road\" after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was \"pretty happy\" when the band’s run came to an end, recalling feeling \"mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted\" by the time Dire Straits disbanded.[131][132] He said he and Knopfler had enjoyed the success of the band, despite the stress of keeping it working, and quoted Knopfler's comment that \"success is great, but fame is [...] something you don’t really want\".[133] Knopfler said: \"I had an absolute ball for as long as it lasted, until it got so big that I didn't know the names of all the roadies [...] It got so big, we were actually leapfrogging stages [running duplicate convoys of equipment].\"[134]\n\nDire Straits remains one of the most popular British rock bands as well as one of the world's most commercially successful artists, with total worldwide album sales of more than 120 million.[16]\n• Grammy Award 1986 – Best Rock Performance by a Duo Or Group (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Grammy Award 1986 – Brothers in Arms Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical (for Brothers in Arms, Mark Knopfler Neil Dorfsman engineer)\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Video of the Year (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Group Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Brit Awards 1987 – British Album of the Year (for Brothers in Arms)\n• Grammy Award 1987 – Best Music Video (for \"Brothers in Arms\")\n• Grammy Award 2006 – Best Surround Sound Album (for his surround sound production for Brothers in Arms—20th Anniversary Edition, Chuck Ainlay, surround mix engineer; Bob Ludwig, surround mastering engineer; Chuck Ainlay and Mark Knopfler, surround producers)\n• Grammy Award 1980 – Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group (for \"Sultans of Swing\")\n• American Music Award 1986 – Favorite Pop/Rock Single (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Brit Awards 1986 – British Album of the Year (for Brothers in Arms)\n• Brit Awards 1986 – British Single (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Brit Awards 1986 – British Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Grammy Award 1986 – Album of the Year (for Brothers in Arms)\n• Grammy Award 1986 – Record of the Year (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Grammy Award 1986 – Song of the Year (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Concept Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Most Experimental Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Stage Performance in a Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Overall Performance in a Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Direction in a Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Visual Effects in a Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Art Direction in a Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Best Editing in a Video (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• MTV Video Music Award 1986 – Viewer's Choice (for \"Money for Nothing\")\n• Brit Awards 2010 – British Album of Thirty Years (for Brothers in Arms)\n• \"Between dire straits\": The Three Weeks\n• None Illsley, John (2021).

Which should I visit while I’m here?Dire Straits - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Dire Straits (pronunciación: /daɪr streɪts/) fue una banda de rock británica formada en Londres en 1977 por Mark Knopfler (voz principal y guitarra principal), David Knopfler (guitarra rítmica y coros), John Illsley (bajo y coros) y Pick Withers (batería y percusión), estando activos hasta el año 1995. Dire Straits es considerado como uno de los grupos musicales más exitosos de la historia de la música rock.[1]​\n\nSu primer sencillo, \"Sultans of Swing\", de su álbum debut homónimo de 1978, llegó a los diez primeros en las listas de éxitos del Reino Unido y los Estados Unidos. Le siguieron éxitos como \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1981), \"Private Investigations\" (1982), \"Twisting by the Pool\" (1983), \"Money for Nothing\" (1985) y \"Walk of Life\" (1985).[2]​ Su álbum de mayor éxito comercial, Brothers in Arms (1985), ha vendido más de 30 millones de copias; fue el primer álbum en vender un millón de copias en disco compacto[3]​[4]​ y es el octavo álbum más vendido en la historia del Reino Unido. Según el Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits ha pasado más de 1100 semanas en la lista de álbumes del Reino Unido, la quinta mayor cantidad de todos los tiempos.[5]​\n\nEl sonido de Dire Straits —cuyo nombre, según el mismo Mark Knopfler, en inglés significa «situación desesperada» o «estar en apuros»— se basa en varias influencias, incluyendo jazz, folk y country y el blues rock de J. J. Cale y Eric Clapton.[6]​ Su sonido despojado contrastaba con el punk rock y demostraba una influencia del roots rock que surgió del pub rock. Hubo varios cambios en el personal, con Mark Knopfler e Illsley siendo los únicos miembros consistentes. Después de disolverse en 1995, Knopfler lanzó su carrera en solitario a tiempo completo. Dire Straits ganó cuatro premios Grammy, tres Brit Awards (Mejor grupo británico dos veces), dos MTV Video Music Awards y varios otros premios.[7]​ Fueron incluidos en el Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll en 2018.\n\nEn 1973, tras graduarse en filología inglesa en la Universidad de Leeds, Mark Knopfler, un joven escocés de Glasgow, decide trasladarse a Londres para intentar hacerse un hueco en el panorama musical. Mark cuenta con experiencias musicales previas poco relevantes de su etapa escolar, y durante su estancia en Leeds conoce a Steve Phillips con quien forma un dúo que se hace llamar The Duolian String Pickers. Los cinco años durante los cuales colaboran juntos son de los más importantes en el desarrollo de Mark como guitarrista.[8]​\n\nLos primeros pasos del joven Mark en la capital los da con una banda de R&B llamada Brewer's Droop con la que hace algunas grabaciones en los Rockfield Studios, propiedad de Dave Edmunds, y participa en unos cuantos conciertos en colegios y otros clubs.[9]​ Es en esta banda donde conoce a Pick Withers, experimentado batería que impresiona muy gratamente a Mark. Después de dos meses de colaboración, tras la grabación del álbum Booze Brothers la banda se disolvió. Pick volvió a trabajar como batería de estudio para otros músicos mientras que Mark inicia una etapa difícil en la que, según sus propias palabras, se moría literalmente de hambre.[9]​ Afortunadamente, su título universitario le permite conseguir finalmente un trabajo como profesor en el Loughton College de Essex, etapa durante la cual vivió dos años en un piso alquilado en Buckhurst Hill y dio también lecciones de guitarra en la Staples Road School.\n\nEn 1976, Mark decide formar con amigos del Loughton College una banda que se hace llamar Café Racers con la que toca en pubs y escuelas cercanas al colegio donde imparte clases. Por esas fechas, su hermano menor David se traslada a Londres y, tras unas semanas alojado en casa de Mark, acaba viviendo en Farrer House, un bloque de apartamentos en el barrio de Deptford, al sudeste de Londres, donde comparte un piso de la primera planta con un bajista de Leicester llamado John Illsley. Una mañana, al regresar a casa después de haber estado fuera toda la noche, John Illsley se encuentra a Mark durmiendo en el suelo del salón con la cabeza recostada en una silla. Fue el primer encuentro entre ambos poco antes de su primera actuación juntos. Una noche en la que el bajista de Café Racers estaba enfermo Mark le pide a John que le sustituya, dando comienzo a una larga y estrecha colaboración. Ambos se dan cuenta pronto de que, a pesar de tener una buena reputación en el ámbito de los pequeños clubs locales, Café Racers tienen un futuro limitado.[8]​\n\nEn abril de 1977, Mark deja su piso de Buckhurst Hill y se traslada a vivir con David y John a Farrer House. Mark mantiene su puesto de profesor, mientras que John trabajaba en una tienda de discos y David como asistente social en Deptford. Desde esa fecha hasta principios del verano de 1977, los tres compañeros dedicaban buena parte de su tiempo libre a ensayar en el apartamento composiciones propias, principalmente de Mark Knopfler. Fue entonces cuando los tres deciden formar un grupo, aunque les falta un batería. Mark piensa en seguida en el antiguo componente de Brewer's Droop, Pick Withers, con quien había tocado en 1973 y que considera ideal para el tipo de música que hacen. Tenía experiencia ya que había tocado con The Primitives y una buena reputación como músico de estudio.\n\nLa llegada de Pick Withers, además de aportar algo de experiencia profesional en el mundo musical, permite completar una verdadera banda de rock, una vieja aspiración de Mark, y empezar a tomarse las cosas más en serio. Las dotes de Mark como músico y compositor se ponen de manifiesto desde un principio, así como su personalidad y su exigencia en conseguir un estilo musical que les distinga del resto. Poco a poco se va erigiendo como líder de la incipiente banda.\n\nEn un comienzo, siguen actuando con el nombre de Café Racers interpretando tanto canciones propias como versiones de temas de otros artistas como Ry Cooder o Brenda Lee. El 9 de julio de 1977 se estrenan con ese nombre en un concierto punk ofrecido en una explanada que había detrás del bloque de apartamentos de Farrer House, para el que tienen que tomar la electricidad del piso en el que viven.[8]​ A este estreno le siguen agotadores ensayos y otros pequeños conciertos, pero apenas ganan lo suficiente para pagar el alquiler del equipo de sonido y poco más. Además, el nombre de Café Racers no termina de convencerles. Finalmente, es un amigo de Pick Withers el que, en alusión a su penosa situación económica, les propone adoptar el nombre con el que saltarían a la fama: Dire Straits (que en castellano viene a significar ‘graves apuros’ o ‘problemas económicos’).\n\nEl 27 de julio de 1977 el grupo graba una maqueta de cinco canciones en los Pathway Studios, al norte de Londres, tras reunir las 120 libras esterlinas que aproximadamente costaba entonces su producción. Las canciones incluidas en ella eran Wild West End, Down to the Waterline, Water of Love, Sacred Loving y el que sería su mayor éxito, Sultans of Swing. La maqueta acaba en las manos de Charlie Gillet, afamado crítico musical londinense y conocido de John Illsley, que queda gratamente impresionado con la música que recibe y decide emitirla en el programa Honky Tonk que presentaba por aquel entonces en la BBC Radio London. Era el domingo 31 de julio de 1977.[10]​ Desde ese momento, ejecutivos de diferentes compañías empiezan a buscar a los autores de aquellos temas, entre ellos John Stainze, responsable del departamento de A&R de la casa discográfica Phonogram Records, de quien se dice que estaba duchándose la primera vez que los escuchó en la radio.[8]​\n\nUnas semanas después, el 10 de septiembre, Dire Straits participa en el Clapham Common Festival, dos conciertos presentados por el propio Gillet y organizados por su programa de radio para promocionar a pequeños grupos musicales. Tras su actuación en el festival, consiguen un contrato para tocar regularmente en dos clubes londinenses de mayor reputación, el Rock Garden y el Hope and Anchor,[10]​ lo cual permite que la situación del grupo vaya mejorando poco a poco a partir de entonces. Los honorarios que reciben les permite cubrir gastos aunque sin lujos, ya que buena parte lo emplean en conseguir un buen sonido en sus actuaciones.\n\nPor fin, a finales de 1977 los Dire Straits consiguen salir del circuito de pequeños locales y dar el salto al mundo de la industria discográfica. El 9 de diciembre, coincidiendo con su última actuación en el Hope and Anchor en el marco del Front Row Festival, firman un contrato exclusivo para el sello Vertigo Records de Phonogram Records de John Stainze, quien inmediatamente se pone a trabajar. Ed Bicknell, mánager de grupos que entonces trabajaba para la agencia de giras y espectáculos NEMS, recibe la petición de Stainze de que consiga algunos conciertos para los Dire Straits. Tras oír el 13 de diciembre una de sus actuaciones en el Dingwalls Club,[8]​[10]​ al norte de Londres, Bicknell llega a un acuerdo para representar oficialmente a la banda y les coloca como teloneros en la inminente gira británica del grupo estadounidense Talking Heads del prometedor David Byrne. Entre el 20 de enero y el 5 de febrero de 1978 dan 16 conciertos, recibiendo críticas tan favorables que no tardan en grabar su primer disco.\n\nDire Straits grabó su primer álbum homónimo entre el 14 de febrero y el 8 de marzo de 1978 en los Basin Street Studios, un tiempo muy escaso para un disco medianamente cuidado que supieron administrar bien, pues empezaban a sentir la presión comercial. El LP, cuyo coste ascendió a doce mil quinientas libras, contenía nueve temas, entre ellos Sultans of Swing, Down to the Waterline o Water of Love, y en él el grupo muestra su agradecimiento a dos figuras importantes hasta ese momento: Charlie Gillet, a quien está dedicado, y el abogado Robert Allan, quien les asesoró en la firma de su contrato.\n\nTras la grabación del disco, Dire Straits se prodigan por toda Inglaterra ofreciendo actuaciones en directo en diversos locales, lo cual les permite darse a conocer y adquirir experiencia a pasos agigantados. La presión sobre la banda es tal que se ven obligados a permitir la retransmisión radiofónica de dos de ellas: una del 13 de abril en Mánchester retransmitida por la BBC, y otra del 19 de abril en Chester ofrecida por Radio Liverpool.[10]​ Phonogram tenía previsto lanzar el disco en mayo, pero debe retrasarse porque el grupo graba el sencillo de Sultans of Swing a finales de abril en los Pathway Studios y faltan algunos pequeños detalles.\n\nEl 22 de mayo inician una minigira por Europa junto al grupo Styx que los lleva a tocar en París, La Haya y Hamburgo, regresando en seguida a Londres para preparar la inminente gira promocional en solitario del disco, que se publicó finalmente el 8 de junio en el Reino Unido. La acogida fue buena por parte de la crítica especializada, pero escasa por el lado del gran público británico. El disco alcanza el puesto 37 en las dos primeras semanas, pero desaparece de los primeros puestos enseguida. Sólo la progresiva publicación del álbum en Europa, Estados Unidos y Oceanía (donde alcanzan rápidamente el número uno en ventas) y el éxito de sus giras en directo hace que el disco se afiance hasta convertirse en un superventas.\n\nA finales de 1978, el grupo inicia en los estudios Compass Point de Nassau (Bahamas) la grabación de su segundo álbum, Communiqué, mientras preparan su primera gira por los Estados Unidos. Las sesiones se desarrollan entre el 28 de noviembre y el 28 de diciembre, aunque la banda decide finalmente que las mezclas finales se lleven a cabo en los Muscle Schoals Studios de Sheffield (Alabama), ya en el mes de enero de 1979. Tras ello, el grupo realiza entre el 6 y el 18 de febrero una pequeña gira por Holanda y Alemania, dos de sus principales mercados hasta ese momento, con varias actuaciones en programas de televisión y radio, y otros cuantos conciertos en los que se agotan las entradas. También ese mismo mes, el álbum Dire Straits alcanza el número uno en ventas en Francia y se convierte en disco de platino en Australia y Nueva Zelanda.\n\nA finales de febrero, Dire Straits inicia su debut en los Estados Unidos con una gira que dura desde el 23 de febrero al 2 de abril de 1979, treinta y ocho días frenéticos en los que ofrecen 51 conciertos ―todos ellos en locales de pequeño aforo con lleno absoluto― en 19 ciudades de ambas costas, incluidas Toronto y Montreal en Canadá; conceden más de 300 entrevistas y visitan numerosos estudios de radio. La gira es un éxito total que dispara las ventas de su primer álbum en tierras americanas hasta convertirse en disco de platino en Estados Unidos en pocas semanas. Entre los miles de espectadores que acudieron a sus conciertos se encontraba Bob Dylan, quien les descubrió en esta gira y no tardó en trabar tal amistad con los miembros del grupo que Mark Knopfler y Pick Withers acudieron en el mes de mayo a su invitación para participar en la grabación de su álbum Slow Train Coming.\n\nPor fin, tras varias semanas de espera el 21 de mayo de 1979 se pone a la venta el nuevo álbum Communiqué. El 8 de junio la banda inicia una nueva gira por su país que se extenderá nuevamente a Estados Unidos (septiembre), Europa Occidental (noviembre) y terminará en diciembre de ese año en Irlanda y Londres. Dire Straits completan un año 1979 realmente triunfal en todos los sentidos, aunque el nivel de exigencia hace que acaben física y mentalmente agotados y se tomen un respiro de seis meses. A ello contribuyen también los primeros síntomas de desavenencias internas protagonizados por David Knopfler, el hermano de Mark, disconforme con la presión que el entorno musical ejerce sobre el ya famoso grupo.\n\nEstos dos primeros trabajos son los que configuraron el sonido de la banda, y en ellos se encuentran algunos de los temas más emblemáticos, como el ya mencionado «Sultans of Swing», en el álbum Dire Straits o «Once upon a Time in the West» y «Portobello Belle», en Communiqué.\n\nEn junio de 1980, tras un largo descanso, los Dire Straits inician las grabaciones de lo que será su tercer disco. Las sesiones se extienden entre el 27 de junio y el 14 de agosto, durante las cuales se produce el abandono de David Knopfler, quien el 25 de julio anuncia oficialmente su retirada del grupo. Sid McGinnis sustituiría a David durante el resto de la grabación, aunque ninguno de los dos aparece en los créditos del álbum.\n\nEl 17 de octubre se publica en todo el mundo el tercer álbum de los Dire Straits, Making Movies, que cuenta con la colaboración a los teclados de Roy Bittan (de la poderosa E Street Band de Bruce Springsteen), que marcó un cambio hacia unos arreglos y una producción más elaborados, tendencia que se mantendría a lo largo de la carrera de la banda. En este disco se incluyen temas como «Tunnel of Love» y «Romeo and Juliet», que toma el título de la obra de Shakespeare y trata de un amor imposible. También están otros grandes éxitos como «Expresso Love» y «Solid Rock».\n\nPara cubrir el hueco dejado por David y proseguir por la senda del sonido iniciado en el último disco, la banda decide incorporar a la formación al guitarrista Hal Lindes, californiano de Monterey, y al tecladista Alan Clark, inglés de Durham. Con el nuevo personal, el siguiente álbum fue publicado en 1982 bajo el título Love Over Gold, con sólo cinco canciones aunque todas ellas de larga duración. Tras concluir su grabación, en julio de 1982, el baterista Pick Withers deja la banda, siendo sustituido por el baterista Terry Williams, quién trabajó con Dave Edmunds de Rockpile. Este cambio hizo volver a sus orígenes de pub-band británica (al igual que lo era Rockpile); con un sonido más sencillo y desenfadado, frente al rock complejo de sus últimos trabajos. El resultado fue un EP con tres canciones bailables, titulado Extended Dance, que incluiría los conocidos temas «Twisting By The Pool» y «Two Young Lovers», además del menos conocido «If I had You».\n\nEl siguiente disco de larga duración en salir al mercado fue el directo Alchemy en 1984, en el que se recogen casi todos los mejores temas de la banda, incluido «Going Home», de la película Local Hero, cuya banda sonora fue publicada como trabajo en solitario de Mark Knopfler. También firmaría en solitario en estos años las bandas sonoras de Comfort & Joy y Cal, donde conocería al tecladista Guy Fletcher.\n\nLos cambios continuaron en la alineación de la banda; el guitarra-rítmica Hal Lindes se fue de la banda en una de las sesiones y entró Jack Sonni para sustituirlo. Además, la banda contrata a Guy Fletcher como un segundo tecladista. En 1985, se lanza a la venta el álbum Brothers in Arms, que se convirtió en un gigantesco éxito en ese año, del que salieron varios singles, incluyendo el que fue número uno, «Money for Nothing». En el álbum participaba también Sting, entre otros. La portada de este disco, con una de las guitarras de Mark Knopfler en ella, es una de las más famosas de la historia de la música contemporánea. En este disco se encuentran, además del ya mencionado «Money for Nothing», temas como «So Far Away», «Walk of Life» o «Brothers in Arms», canción que trata del horror de la guerra con un fondo musical que hace la letra aún más estremecedora, si cabe.\n\nLa gira mundial que siguió al álbum en 1985-86 fue un auténtico éxito, incluyendo una aparición en Live Aid el 13 de julio de 1985, con Sting como vocalista invitado. La gira finalizó en el Entertainment Centre de Sídney, Australia, en 1986, donde Dire Straits todavía mantiene el récord de apariciones consecutivas (veintiún noches), la última de las cuales es conocida por su versión calypso de «So Far Away» y una improvisación de la canción folk australiana «Waltzing Matilda». En un período de dos años, Dire Straits tocó 247 conciertos en más de cien ciudades diferentes.\n\nAyudó al gran éxito de este disco, Brothers in Arms, el hecho de que fue uno de los primeros trabajos grabado digitalmente en su totalidad y que estuvo disponible en el novedoso (en aquel momento) formato Compact Disc. Esto tuvo el efecto colateral de hacerlo uno de los álbumes más vendidos entre los consumidores partidarios de esta nueva tecnología. Asimismo, el nuevo formato era un excelente escaparate para una meticulosa producción de Knopfler de sus primeros álbumes, lo que llevó a muchos seguidores a volver a comprar los anteriores trabajos. En parte como resultado de esto Dire Straits fue la banda con mayores ventas en el mundo a mediados de los años 80.\n\nEn los siguientes seis años tuvieron un largo periodo de inactividad, donde los distintos miembros de la banda continuaron con sus trabajos en solitario. Tan solo rompieron el silencio con la publicación del recopilatorio Money for Nothing (1988) y con la exitosa aparición en el concierto de celebración del 70.º aniversario de Nelson Mandela junto a Eric Clapton (Wembley Stadium, Londres, 11 de junio de 1988), el cual interpretó su exitosa canción \"Wonderful Tonight\" junto a la banda, aparte de colaborar como guitarrista rítmico en las otras interpretaciones de Dire Straits en dicho concierto. Su último álbum de estudio, On Every Street, se lanzó en 1991. En él participaba el personal de Brothers In Arms entre un conjunto de músicos de estudio. El álbum, a diferencia de su antecesor Brothers In Arms, fue recibido con división de opiniones y con un éxito más moderado. La gira de 1991-92 (inicialmente planificada para 300 conciertos hasta bien entrado el 93) que siguió a On Every Street no tuvo tanto éxito como la anterior de 1985-86. El último concierto de Dire Straits tuvo lugar el 9 de octubre de 1992 ante unas 40.000 personas en el estadio de La Romareda, en Zaragoza. Más adelante, publicarían los directos On The Night (de la gira 1991-92) y Live at the BBC (con temas en directo grabados en la emisora pública inglesa en los primeros años de actividad de la banda) en los años 1993 y 1995, respectivamente. Después de todo esto, la banda volvió al silencio.\n\nFinalmente, en 1995, la banda anunció su disolución. Mark Knopfler se concentraría en proyectos en solitario y bandas sonoras para películas; muchas de ellas, en colaboración con el teclista de Dire Straits, Guy Fletcher. El bajista John Illsley, el único miembro junto a Mark Knopfler que se había mantenido desde la formación inicial de la banda, pasó a dedicarse a la pintura, en 2008 regresó al panorama musical con un álbum titulado Beautiful You y en 2010 publicó Streets Of Heaven. Otros antiguos miembros continuaron sus carreras musicales, como David Knopfler o el baterista Pick Withers, que pasó a trabajar en bandas de jazz.\n\nEn 2008, John Illsley anunció la posible vuelta de la banda para el Festival Rock In Rio. La noticia fue desmentida en repetidas ocasiones, y desde entonces Mark Knopfler ha expresado su rechazo a una reunión siempre que se le ha preguntado.[11]​ En 2012 se forma la banda tributo The Straits formada por antiguos miembros de Dire Straits, como Alan Clark, Chris White o Phil Palmer, aunque este último abandonaría la banda poco después.\n\nThe Straits ―el septeto liderado por Alan Clark y Chris White y completado por Steve Ferrone (batería de Tom Petty), Terence Reis (voz, guitarra), Mike Feat (bajo), Adam Phillips (guitarra) y Jamie Squire (más teclado, que canta como Michael Jackson)― inició una larga gira europea (18 fechas en Escandinavia, Alemania, Iberia) a partir de marzo del 2012.\n\nEl 13 de diciembre de 2017, se anunció que Dire Straits finalmente ingresaría al Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll junto a Bon Jovi, Nina Simone, The Moody Blues, Sister Rosetta Tharpe y The Cars.[12]​ Los miembros honorados fueron Mark Knopfler, John Illsley, Pick Withers, David Knopfler, Guy Fletcher y Alan Clark.[13]​ De esta manera, Dire Straits se convirtió en una de las pocas agrupaciones en ingresar al Salón de la Fama tras ser nominados por primera vez. Con el anuncio, comenzaron los rumores de una posible reunión con motivo de la Ceremonia de Inclusión al Salón de la Fama del Rock And Roll. Varios de los miembros de la banda habían anunciado su asistencia, pero aclararon que una reunión sobre el escenario sólo ocurriría si Mark Knopfler accedía a reunir nuevamente a Dire Straits. Los miembros Alan Clark, Guy Fletcher y John Illsley asistieron a la ceremonia de inducción, que se celebró en abril de 2018. Sin embargo, el guitarrista y líder no dio ninguna declaración al respecto, ni tampoco asistió a dicha ceremonia.[14]​\n\nLa discografía de Dire Straits se compone de seis álbumes de estudio, tres álbumes en directo, tres álbumes recopilatorios, dos EP y 23 sencillos.\n• Cómo se organizaba un concierto de R & R el siglo pasado ─Dire Straits en Barcelona el 5 y 6 de junio de 1985─\n• 38 años que los Dire Straits actuaron por primera vez en EspañaBrothers in Arms (album) - Wikipedia: Brothers in Arms is the fifth studio album by the British rock band Dire Straits, released on 17 May 1985,[2] by Vertigo Records internationally and Warner Bros. Records in the United States. It was the first album in history to sell over one million copies in CD format.[3]\n\nBrothers in Arms spent a total of 14 non-consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart (including ten consecutive weeks between 18 January and 22 March 1986), nine weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 in the United States and 34 weeks at number one on the Australian Albums Chart. It was the first album to be certified ten-times platinum in the UK[4] and is the eighth-best-selling album in UK chart history.[5] It is certified nine-times platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and is one of the world's best-selling albums, having sold more than 30 million copies worldwide.[6][7][8]\n\nThe album won a Grammy Award in 1986 for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical and Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards; the 20th Anniversary reissue won another Grammy in 2006 for Best Surround Sound Album. In 2020, Rolling Stone placed Brothers in Arms at number 418 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Q magazine ranked Brothers in Arms number 51 on its list of the \"100 Greatest British Albums Ever\".\n\nBrothers in Arms was recorded from November 1984 to February 1985 at AIR Studios on the island of Montserrat, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean.[9] The album was produced by songwriter Mark Knopfler and Neil Dorfsman, who had engineered Dire Straits' 1982 album Love over Gold and Knopfler's 1983 soundtrack album Local Hero.[10]\n\nBrothers in Arms was one of the first albums recorded on a Sony 24-track digital tape machine. The decision to move to digital recording came from Knopfler's constant striving for better sound quality. \"One of the things that I totally respected about him,\" Dorfsman observed, \"was his interest in technology as a means of improving his music. He was always willing to spend on high-quality equipment.\"[10]\n\nBefore arriving at Montserrat, Knopfler had written all the songs and rehearsed them with the band. The studio lineup was Knopfler (vocals, guitar), John Illsley (bass), Hal Lindes (guitar), Alan Clark (keyboards), Terry Williams (drums) and new member Guy Fletcher (keyboards, backing vocals). Lindes left the band early on in the sessions, and was replaced in December 1984 by Jack Sonni, a New York-based guitarist and longstanding friend of Knopfler. (Sonni's only contribution to the album was the guitar synthesizer on \"The Man's Too Strong\", with all the other guitar parts played by Knopfler).[11]\n\nThe studio itself was small, with a 20-by-25-foot (6 m × 8 m) recording space that offered virtually no isolation. \"It was a good-sounding studio,\" Dorfsman later recalled, \"but the main room itself was nothing to write home about. The sound of that studio was the desk,\" referring to the Neve 8078 board.[10] Knopfler and Dorfsman utilised the limited space to best effect, placing the drum kit in the far left corner, facing the control room, miked with Sennheiser MD 421s on the toms, an Electro-Voice RE20 and AKG D12 on the kick drum, a Shure SM57 and AKG C451 with a 20 dB pad on the snare, 451s for overheads and the hi-hat, and Neumann U87s set back a little to capture \"some kind of ambience\".[10] They placed the piano in a tight booth in the far right corner of the studio, miked with AKG C414s. The Hammond B3 was placed nearby, with its Leslie speaker crammed into an airlock next to the control room. Illsley's bass amplifier was recorded inside a small vocal booth with a Neumann FET 47 and a DI unit. Knopfler's amplifiers were miked with 57s, 451s, and Neumann U67s. Fletcher's synths were placed in the control room.[10]\n\nDuring the recording of \"Money for Nothing\", the signature sound of Knopfler's guitar may have been enhanced by a \"happy accident\" of microphone placement. Knopfler was using his Gibson Les Paul going through a Laney amplifier. While setting up the guitar amplifier microphones in an effort to get the \"ZZ Top sound\" that Knopfler sought, guitar tech Ron Eve, who was in the control room, heard the \"amazing\" sound before Dorfsman was finished arranging the mics. \"One mic was pointing down at the floor,\" Dorfsman remembered, \"another was not quite on the speaker, another was somewhere else, and it wasn't how I would want to set things up—it was probably just left from the night before, when I'd been preparing things for the next day and had not really finished the setup.\"[10] What they heard was exactly what ended up on the record; no additional processing or effects were used during the mix.[10]\n\nAccording to a Sound on Sound magazine interview with Neil Dorfsman, during the first month of the recording sessions at Montserrat the performance of Terry Williams was considered to be unsuitable for the desired sound of the album.[10] According to Williams himself, he had recorded all his drum parts to a click track, which he felt hindered his ability to channel the rhythmic feel he wanted. About six weeks into the sessions, after listening to a playback of what had been recorded so far, he voiced his disappointment to Mark Knopfler over some of his own playing. Shortly after this, he was dismissed from the sessions.[12][13]\n\nDorfsman and Knopfler made the decision to erase Williams' contributions.[12] Williams was replaced in the sessions by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded all the album's drum parts during a two-day stay before leaving for other commitments.[10] All of the drumming on the final album was performed by Hakim, with the exception of the improvised crescendo at the beginning of \"Money for Nothing\".[14] (In another interview, Dorfsman has said that Williams' fills and tom-toms were also used in the rest of \"Money for Nothing\").[15] Both Hakim and Williams are credited on the album.[16]\n\nA defective batch of recording tape at AIR Studios resulted in the loss of part or all of three album tracks, leading to follow-up sessions being recorded at the Power Station in New York during early 1985[11] (including the addition of a Jack Sonni guitar synthesizer part to “The Man's Too Strong”)[citation needed]. During this time, overdubs were recorded with further New York musicians including Michael and Randy Brecker, Mike Mainieri (who'd previously contributed vibraphone to Love Over Gold) and percussionist Jimmy Maelen, plus trumpeter Dave Plews and Average White Band saxophonist Malcolm Duncan.\n\nWhen Illsley broke both elbows after a fall whilst jogging in Central Park, several prominent New York studio bassists were hired to record or re-record several basslines on the record. Tony Levin contributed to \"Why Worry\". Saturday Night Live house band bassist Neil Jason was brought in for a week's work which included takes on \"So Far Away\", \"Walk of Life\", \"Ride Across the River\", \"Your Latest Trick\" and \"The Man's Too Strong\", although the only fully confirmed released results from the Jason sessions were the slap-style funk bassline on \"One World\" and \"slides on my fretless — almost like a Syndrum effect\" on the intro to the extended version of “Money for Nothing”.[11][17]\n\nAlthough Andy Kanavan was briefly recruited as Dire Straits' new drummer, Terry Williams ended up rejoining the band for the promotional concert world tour which lasted until April 1986.[16] All the music videos that were released from the album featured Williams.[12]\n\nBrothers in Arms has been described musically as a pop rock album.[18] The music video for \"Money for Nothing\" received heavy rotation on MTV, and it was the first to be aired on MTV Europe when the network launched on 1 August 1987.[19] It is one of only two Dire Straits songs on a studio album not to be solely credited to Knopfler (the other being \"The Carousel Waltz\", which opens Making Movies), with guest vocalist Sting given a co-writing credit due to the melody of the repeated \"I want my MTV\" (sung by Sting) at the start echoing the melody of the Police's \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\".[20]\n\n\"Walk of Life\" was a number two hit in the UK Singles Chart in early 1986 and a number seven hit in the US Billboard Hot 100 later that year. The song was nearly left off the album, but was included after the band out-voted producer Neil Dorfsman.\n\nOn the second side of the album, three songs (\"Ride Across the River\", \"The Man's Too Strong\" and \"Brothers in Arms\") are lyrically focused on militarism. \"Ride Across the River\" uses immersive Latin American imagery, accompanied by synthesized pan flute, mariachi trumpet, a reggae-influenced drum part and eerie background noises. \"The Man's Too Strong\" depicts the character of an ancient soldier (or war criminal) and his fear of showing feelings as a weakness. Written during the 1982 Falklands War, \"Brothers in Arms\" deals with the senselessness of war.[21]\n\nIn 2007, the 25th anniversary of the war, Knopfler recorded a new version of the song at Abbey Road Studios to raise funds for British veterans who he said \"are still suffering from the effects of that conflict\".[22]\n\nThe guitar featured on the front of the album cover is Mark Knopfler's 1937 14-fret National Style \"O\" Resonator.[23] The Style \"O\" line of guitars was introduced in 1930 and discontinued in 1941. The photographer was Deborah Feingold.[24] The back cover features a painting of the same guitar, by German artist Thomas Steyer. A similar image was also used, with a similar colour scheme, for the 1989 album The Booze Brothers by Brewers Droop, which features Knopfler on a few tracks.\n\nBrothers in Arms was one of the first albums directed at the CD market, and it was a full digital recording (DDD) at a time when most popular music was recorded on analog equipment. It was also released on vinyl (abridged to fit on one LP) and cassette. Producer Neil Dorfsman says the digital multitrack was mixed on a Solid State Logic analog board, with the resulting two track mix re-digitized via a Prism A/D converter and recorded on a DAT machine.[25]\n\nBrothers in Arms was the first album to sell one million copies in the CD format and to outsell its LP version. Rykodisc co-founder Rob Simonds subsequently wrote, \"[In 1985] we were fighting to get our CDs manufactured because the entire worldwide manufacturing capacity was overwhelmed by demand for a single rock title (Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms).\"[26]\n\nIt was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 for most of the world outside the United States and on 19 September 2000 in the United States, the remastering for both reissues was done by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering using the Super Bit Mapping process.[27] In 2000, it was released on XRCD2 format, this edition was remastered by Hiromichi Takiguchi using K2 20bit technology.[28] A 20th Anniversary Edition was issued in Super Audio CD on 26 July 2005 (becoming the 3000th title for the SACD format), it featured a 5.1 surround sound remix done by Chuck Ainlay at British Grove Studios, it was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering.[29] The 5.1 mix was also released on DualDisc format with DVD-Audio 24 bit/96 kHz track on 16 August 2005. Ainlay's 5.1 remix won a Grammy for Best Surround Sound Album at the 48th Grammy Awards ceremony.[30][31] In 2006, a half-speed–mastered vinyl version of the album was issued. Mastered by Stan Ricker, this version consists of four sides on two 33 1/3 rpm discs, containing the full-length songs on vinyl for the first time. In 2013, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a hybrid SACD mastered from the original tapes by Shawn R. Britton, it includes the original stereo mix only.[32] In 2014, a new master was released in Japan on SHM-SACD - it's made from the original analogue master tapes and contains the original LP length of the album: 47:44 min, this edition was transferred by Mick McKenna and Richard Whittaker at FX Copyroom using Direct Stream Digital. On 19 May 2014, Vertigo reissued the album on double 180g vinyl, this edition contains the full-length songs of the album, it was mastered by Bob Ludwig, Bernie Grundman and Chris Bellman from the original analogue and digital tapes, this version was also included on The Studio Albums 1978 - 1991 the previous year.[33] In 2015, Mobile Fidelity also released the album on double 45 RPM vinyl, this edition was mastered by Krieg Wunderlich.[34] The same year, the album re-entered the UK Album Charts at #8 following the record being made available at a discounted price on digital music retailers. In March 2021, a new half-speed mastered edition was released, mastered at Abbey Road Studios by Miles Showell. The release was a double-LP, 45 rpm, 180 gram edition, with the complete version of the album, for only the second time (the first being issued by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab in 2015). The album has spent a total of 356 weeks on the UK Album Charts.\n\nInitial reviews of Brothers in Arms from the UK music press in 1985 were generally negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow criticised Knopfler's \"mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit\". He also accused the album of the \"tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio\".[45] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror dismissed the \"West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock.\"[42]\n\nThe reviews from other UK music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that \"it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here.\"[44] Melody Maker's Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that \"this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise... Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR\". He concluded, \"the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story\".[46]\n\nUS reviews were more positive. Writing for Spin magazine, E. Brooks praised Knopfler's guitar work and noted that \"when the intensity of his words approaches that of his ravishing stratocaster licks, the song soars. That doesn't happen as often as I'd like on this new album [...] but I find myself returning to certain cuts the way one might come back to a favorite chair.\" Brooks singled out the \"haunting ballad\" \"Your Latest Trick\", the \"acerbic satire of vid-rock culture\" in \"Money for Nothing\" and the \"outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music\" of the title track, which was \"not a new message, but at least something other than sex, cars, or drugs is being talked about here. Take that and the quality of the musicianship, and you've got a lot.\"[47] Debby Bull gave the album a mixed review for Rolling Stone magazine, praising the \"carefully crafted\" effort, writing, \"The record is beautifully produced, with Mark Knopfler's terrific guitar work catching the best light\". Although she found the lyrics literate, Bull noted that the scenarios \"aren't as interesting as they used to be on records like Making Movies\". Despite the production values and notable contributions from guest artists like drummer Omar Hakim and the Brecker Brothers, Bull concluded that \"the music lacks the ache that made Knopfler's recent soundtracks for Comfort and Joy and Cal so powerful.\"[48] In Rolling Stone's end-of-year round-up of 1985's key albums, Fred Schruers said that \"Knopfler's nimble, evocative guitar style and gentle vocalizing are still as appealing as they were on previous scenario-rich albums\".[49]\n\nLater reviews have praised the record. Reviewing the remastered Dire Straits albums in 1996, Rob Beattie of Q awarded Brothers in Arms five stars out of five and wrote that \"repeated listening reveals it as a singularly melancholic collection – see the guitar slashing of 'The Man's Too Strong' and the title track, where joy is as sharp as sorrow\".[41] In a 2007 review for BBC Music, Chris Jones called Brothers in Arms \"a phenomenon on every level... a suite of Knopfler's very fine brand of JJ Cale-lite\".[50] In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, crediting the international success of the album not only to the clever computer-animated video for \"Money for Nothing\", but also to Knopfler's \"increased sense of pop songcraft\". According to Erlewine, Dire Straits had \"never been so concise or pop-oriented, and it wore well on them\". Erlewine concluded that the album remains \"one of their most focused and accomplished albums, and in its succinct pop sense, it's distinctive within their catalog\".[35]\n\nIn 2010, when Brothers in Arms was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the past 30 years by the Brit Awards, music broadcaster and author Paul Gambaccini described the list of nominees as \"risible\" but added, \"Brothers in Arms runs away with it for the quality of songwriting and musicianship.\"[51][52]\n\nBrothers in Arms won Best British Album at the 1987 Brit Awards[53] (in a first-time occurrence, it had actually been nominated for Best Album a year earlier at the 1986 Brit Awards but lost out to Phil Collins' No Jacket Required, before being nominated again the following year due to its chart longevity).[54] Also in 1986, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while the 20th Anniversary Edition won another Grammy in 2006 for Best Surround Sound Album.[55]\n\nIn 2000, Q magazine placed the album at number 51 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever.[56] In 2003, the album ranked number 351 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\",[57] and number 352 in a 2012 revised list, and number 418 in the 2020 revision.[58][59] The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.[60]\n\nIn November 2006 the results of a national poll conducted by the public of Australia revealed their top 100 favourite albums. Brothers in Arms came in at number 64 (see \"My Favourite Album\"). Brothers in Arms is ranked number three in the best albums of 1985 and number 31 in the best albums of the 1980s.[citation needed]\n\nAs of July 2016 Brothers in Arms is the eighth-best-selling album of all-time in the UK.[61] In the Netherlands, the album held the record for longest run ever on the Dutch Album chart with 269 weeks (non-consecutive) but was surpassed by Adele's album 21 in 2016.\n\nAll songs written by Mark Knopfler, except \"Money for Nothing\", written by Knopfler and Sting. The CD and cassette versions feature full versions of \"So Far Away\", \"Money for Nothing\", \"Your Latest Trick\" and \"Why Worry\". Because of this, side two of the cassette version has about 10 minutes of blank tape.\n• Bob Ludwig – mastering at Masterdisk (New York City, New York, USA)\n• In the Netherlands, the album broke the all-time record for most weeks on chart, with 269 non-consecutive weeks (since overtaken by Adele's 21 and the Buena Vista Social Club's eponymous debut album). 68\n• In the UK, the album spent 14 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, 69 and as of August 2018 has spent 271 weeks on the chart. 70\n• In the United States, the album reached number one on the Billboard 200 and remained there for nine weeks. 71\n• List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom\n• List of best-selling albums in New Zealand\n• Brothers in Arms Archived 26 October 2020 at the Wayback Machine at Mark Knopfler's websiteWear Your Why: Brothers in Arms is a distinguished community of guardians, united by an unwavering dedication to the highest values of protection, unity, and self-improvement.

It was written in 1982, the year of Britain's involvement in the Falklands War.\n\nIn 2007, the 25th anniversary of the war, Mark Knopfler recorded a new version of the song at Abbey Road Studios to raise funds for British veterans who he said \"are still suffering from the effects of that conflict.\"[2] \"Brothers in Arms\" has become a favourite at military funerals.[3]\n\nThis song was written during the Falklands War and is described by some as an anti-war song.[4]\n\n\"Brothers in Arms\" was first released as a single on 18 October 1985. The song is reported to be the first CD single ever released;[5][better source needed] it was released in the United Kingdom in 1986.\n\nThe song's lyrics, influence, and impact were discussed from a variety of musical and personal perspectives in the BBC radio programme and podcast Soul Music first broadcast in September 2012.[6]\n\nClassic Rock critic Paul Rees rated \"Brothers in Arms\" to be Dire Straits' 5th greatest song, citing its \"dignified but lasting power\" and a \"stunning guitar solo.\"[7]\n\nSpin noted the, \"political theme with outstanding craftsmanship in the words and music. The singing is quiet but authoritative, and Knopfler's Les paul cuts a dark swath across the battle-scarred landscape conjured up by the lyrics.\"[8]\n\nThe music video, directed and animated by Bill Mather, produced by Simon Fields through Limelight Films and cinematographed by Francis Kenny,[9] uses rotoscoping and shows the band performing, overlaid with images of the First World War. In contrast with the at-that-time very modern clip in \"Money for Nothing\", the video clip has a very classic appearance in noisy black and white images.[10]\n\n\"Brothers in Arms\" won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video at the 29th Annual Grammy Awards on 24 February 1987.\n\nThe song appeared in several television programmes including the second season finale of The West Wing: \"Two Cathedrals\" from 2001,[11] a 1998 episode of Canadian police procedural Due South (\"I Coulda Been a Defendant\"), and the final episode of The Grand Tour hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May, as they rounded off 22 years of presenting motoring television in 2024. It has further appeared as the end credits to Civvies (1992), a TV mini series about former forces personnel trying to navigate the civilian world, as well as in television show Miami Vice (\"Out Where the Buses Don't Run\" from 1985), the series finale of Cold War thriller The Americans and the 2001 action thriller Spy Game.\n• \"Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero)\" (Live) – 4:45\n• \"Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero)\" (Live) – 4:45"}

PRF is the only non-profit organization solely dedicated to finding treatments and the cure for Progeria, and is making phenomenal progress toward that goal.Progeria - Wikipedia: Progeria is a specific type of progeroid syndrome, also known as Hutchinson–Gilford syndrome or Hutchinson–Gilford progeroid syndrome (HGPS).[8] A single gene mutation is responsible for causing progeria. The affected gene, known as lamin A (LMNA), makes a protein necessary for holding the cell nucleus together. When this gene mutates, an abnormal form of lamin A protein called progerin is produced. Progeroid syndromes are a group of diseases that cause individuals to age faster than usual, leading to them appearing older than they actually are. People born with progeria typically live until their mid- to late-teens or early twenties.[9][10] Severe cardiovascular complications usually develop by puberty, later on resulting in death.\n\nMost children with progeria appear normal at birth and during early infancy.[11] Children with progeria usually develop the first symptoms during their first few months of life. The earliest symptoms may include a failure to thrive and a localized scleroderma-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent, usually around 18–24 months. Limited growth, full-body alopecia (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow, recessed jaw and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.[5]\n\nSigns and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular problems.[12] Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of older adults. The head is usually large relative to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor function.[citation needed]\n\nHutchinson-Gilford progeroid syndrome (HGPS) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder in which symptoms resembling aspects of aging are manifested at an early age.[8] Its occurrence is usually the result of a sporadic germline mutation; although HGPS is genetically dominant, people rarely live long enough to have children, preventing them from passing the disorder on in a hereditary manner.[13]\n\nHGPS is caused by mutations that weaken the structure of the cell nucleus, making normal cell division difficult. The histone mark H4K20me3 is involved and caused by de novo mutations that occur in a gene that encodes lamin A. Lamin A is made but is not processed properly. This poor processing creates an abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized heterochromatin. Patients also do not have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability.[14]\n\nIn normal conditions, the LMNA gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A, which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A.[15] Prelamin A contains a \"CAAX\" where C is a cysteine, A an aliphatic amino acid, and X any amino acid. This motif at the carboxyl-termini of proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications. First, protein farnesyltransferase catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine. Second, an endoprotease that recognizes the farnesylated protein catalyzes the peptide bond's cleavage between the cysteine and -aaX. In the third step, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesyl cysteine. The farnesylated and methylated protein is transported through a nuclear pore to the interior of the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the protein is cleaved by a protease called zinc metallopeptidase STE24 (ZMPSTE24), which removes the last 15 amino acids, which includes the farnesylated cysteine. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as lamin A. In most mammalian cells, lamin A, along with lamin B1, lamin B2, and lamin C, makes up the nuclear lamina, which provides shape and stability to the inner nuclear envelope.[citation needed]\n\nBefore the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a point mutation in position 1824 of the LMNA gene, which replaces a cytosine with thymine.[16] This mutation creates a 5' cryptic splice site within exon 11, resulting in a shorter than normal mRNA transcript. When this shorter mRNA is translated into protein, it produces an abnormal variant of the prelamin A protein, referred to as progerin. Progerin's farnesyl group cannot be removed because the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site is lacking from progerin, so the abnormal protein is permanently attached to the nuclear rim. One result is that the nuclear lamina does not provide the nuclear envelope with enough structural support, causing it to take on an abnormal shape.[17] Since the support that the nuclear lamina normally provides is necessary for the organizing of chromatin during mitosis, weakening of the nuclear lamina limits the ability of the cell to divide.[18] However, defective cell division is unlikely to be the main defect leading to progeria, particularly because children develop normally without any signs of disease until about one year of age. Farnesylated prelamin A variants also lead to defective DNA repair, which may play a role in the development of progeria.[19] Progerin expression also leads to defects in the establishment of fibroblast cell polarity, which is also seen in physiological aging.[20]\n\nTo date, over 1,400 SNPs in the LMNA gene are known.[21] They can manifest as changes in mRNA, splicing, or protein amino acid sequence (e.g. Arg471Cys,[22] Arg482Gln,[23] Arg527Leu,[24] Arg527Cys,[25] and Ala529Val).[26] Progerin may also play a role in normal human aging, since its production is activated in typical senescent cells.[18] Unlike other \"accelerated aging diseases\", such as Werner syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, or xeroderma pigmentosum, progeria may not be directly caused by defective DNA repair. These diseases each cause changes in a few specific aspects of aging but never in every aspect at once, so they are often called \"segmental progerias\".[27]\n\nA 2003 report in Nature[28] said that progeria may be a de novo dominant trait. It develops during cell division in a newly conceived zygote or in the gametes of one of the parents. It is caused by mutations in the LMNA (lamin A protein) gene on chromosome 1; the mutated form of lamin A is commonly known as progerin. One of the authors, Leslie Gordon, was a physician who did not know anything about progeria until her own son, Sam, was diagnosed at 22 months. Gordon and her husband, pediatrician Scott Berns, founded the Progeria Research Foundation.[29]\n\nA subset of progeria patients with heterozygous mutations of LMNA have presented an atypical form of the condition, with initial symptoms not developing until late childhood or early adolescence. These patients have had longer lifespans than those with typical-onset progeria.[11] This atypical form is extremely rare, with presentations of the condition varying between patients with even the same mutation.[30] The general phenotype of atypical cases is consistent with typical progeria, but other factors (severity, onset, and lifespan) vary in presentation.[31]\n\nLamin A is a major component of a protein scaffold on the inner edge of the nucleus called the nuclear lamina that helps organize nuclear processes such as RNA and DNA synthesis.[citation needed]\n\nPrelamin A contains a CAAX box at the C-terminus of the protein (where C is a cysteine and A is any aliphatic amino acids). This ensures that the cysteine is farnesylated and allows prelamin A to bind membranes, specifically the nuclear membrane. After prelamin A has been localized to the cell nuclear membrane, the C-terminal amino acids, including the farnesylated cysteine, are cleaved off by a specific protease. The resulting protein, now lamin A, is no longer membrane-bound and carries out functions inside the nucleus.[citation needed]\n\nIn HGPS, the recognition site that the enzyme requires for cleavage of prelamin A to lamin A is mutated. Lamin A cannot be produced, and prelamin A builds up on the nuclear membrane, causing a characteristic nuclear blebbing.[32] This results in the symptoms of progeria, although the relationship between the misshapen nucleus and the symptoms is not known.\n\nA study that compared HGPS patient cells with the skin cells from young and elderly normal human subjects found similar defects in the HGPS and elderly cells, including down-regulation of certain nuclear proteins, increased DNA damage, and demethylation of histone, leading to reduced heterochromatin.[33] Nematodes over their lifespan show progressive lamin changes comparable to HGPS in all cells but neurons and gametes.[34] These studies suggest that lamin A defects are associated with normal aging.[33][35]\n\nThe presence of progerin also leads to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria within the cell. These mitochondria are characterized by a swollen morphology, caused by a condensation of mtDNA and TFAM into the mitochondria, which is driven by a severe mitochondrial dysfunction (low mitochondrial membrane potential, low ATP production, low respiration capacity and high ROS production).[36][37][38] Therefore, contributing substantially to the senescence phenotype. Although, the explanation for this defective-mitochondria accumulation in progeria is about to be elucidated, it has been proposed that low PGC1-α expression[36][37][39] (important for mitochondrial biogenesis, maintenance and function) along with low LAMP2 protein level and lysosome number (both important for mitophagy: the degradation of defective mitochondria pathway),[36] could be implicated.\n\nSkin changes, abnormal growth, and loss of hair occur. These symptoms normally start appearing by one year of age. A genetic test for LMNA mutations can confirm the diagnosis of progeria.[40][41] Prior to the advent of the genetic test, misdiagnosis was common.[41]\n\nIn November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved lonafarnib, which helps prevent buildup of defective progerin and similar proteins.[43] A clinical trial in 2018 points to significantly lower mortality rates – treatment with lonafarnib alone compared with no treatment (3.7% vs. 33.3%) – at a median post-trial follow-up time span of 2.2 years.[44] The drug, given orphan drug status and Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, is taken twice daily in the form of capsules and may cost US$650,000 per year, making it prohibitive for the vast majority of families. It is unclear how it will be covered by health insurance in the United States. Common side effects of the drug include \"nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, infections, decreased appetite, and fatigue\".[13]\n\nOther treatment options have focused on reducing complications (such as cardiovascular disease) with coronary artery bypass surgery and low-dose acetylsalicylic acid.[45] Growth hormone treatment has been attempted.[46] The use of Morpholinos has also been attempted in mice and cell cultures in order to reduce progerin production. Antisense Morpholino oligonucleotides specifically directed against the mutated exon 11–exon 12 junction in the mutated pre-mRNAs were used.[47]\n\nA type of anticancer drug, the farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs), has been proposed, but their use has been mostly limited to animal models.[48] A Phase II clinical trial using the FTI lonafarnib began in May 2007.[49] In studies on the cells another anti-cancer drug, rapamycin, caused removal of progerin from the nuclear membrane through autophagy.[17][50] It has been proved that pravastatin and zoledronate are effective drugs when it comes to the blocking of farnesyl group production.[citation needed]\n\nFarnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are drugs that inhibit the activity of an enzyme needed to make a link between progerin proteins and farnesyl groups. This link generates the permanent attachment of the progerin to the nuclear rim. In progeria, cellular damage can occur because that attachment occurs, and the nucleus is not in a normal state. Lonafarnib is an FTI, which means it can avoid this link, so progerin can not remain attached to the nucleus rim, and it now has a more normal state.[citation needed]\n\nStudies of sirolimus, an mTOR Inhibitor, demonstrate that it can minimize the phenotypic effects of progeria fibroblasts. Other observed consequences of its use are abolishing nuclear blebbing, degradation of progerin in affected cells, and reducing insoluble progerin aggregates formation. These results have been observed only in vitro and are not the results of any clinical trial, although it is believed that the treatment might benefit HGPS patients.[17]\n\nRecently, it has been demonstrated that the CRM1 protein (a key component of the nuclear export machinery in mammalian) is upregulated in HGPS cells, which drives to the abnormal localization of NES containing proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.[51] Moreover, the inhibition of CRM1 in HGPS alleviates the associated-senescence phenotype[51] as well as the mitochondrial function (an important determinant in senescence) and lysosome content.[36] These results are under in vivo validation with selinexor (a more suitable CRM1 inhibitor for human use[52]).\n\nAs there is no known cure, life expectancy of people with progeria is 15 years, as of 2024.[53] At least 90 percent of patients die from complications of atherosclerosis, such as heart attack or stroke.[54]\n\nMental development is not adversely affected; in fact, intelligence tends to be average to above average.[55] With respect to the features of aging that progeria appears to manifest, the development of symptoms is comparable to aging at a rate eight to ten times faster than normal. With respect to those that progeria does not exhibit, patients show no neurodegeneration or cancer predisposition. They also do not develop conditions that are commonly associated with accumulation of damage, such as cataracts (caused by UV exposure) and osteoarthritis.[40]\n\nAlthough there may not be any successful treatments for progeria itself, there are treatments for the problems it causes, such as arthritic, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems, and recent medicinal breakthroughs enabled one patient to live until age 28.[56] People with progeria have normal reproductive development, and there are known cases of women with progeria who delivered healthy offspring.[57]\n\nA study from the Netherlands has shown an incidence of 1 in 20 million births.[58] According to the Progeria Research Foundation, as of September 2020, there are 179 known cases in the world, in 53 countries; 18 of the cases were identified in the United States.[59][13] Hundreds of cases have been reported in medical history since 1886.[60][61][62] However, the Progeria Research Foundation believes there may be as many as 150 undiagnosed cases worldwide.[63]\n\nThere have been only two cases in which a healthy person was known to carry the LMNA mutation that causes progeria.[64] One family from India had four of six children with progeria.[65]\n\nA mouse model of progeria exists, though in the mouse, the LMNA prelamin A is not mutated. Instead, ZMPSTE24, the specific protease that is required to remove the C-terminus of prelamin A, is missing. Both cases result in the buildup of farnesylated prelamin A on the nuclear membrane and in the characteristic nuclear LMNA blebbing.\n\nIn 2020, BASE editing was used in a mouse model to target the LMNA gene mutation that causes the progerin protein instead of the healthy Lamin A[66][67] while in 2023 a study designed a peptide that prevented progerin from binding to BubR1[68] which is known to regulate aging in mice.[69]\n\nRepair of DNA double-strand breaks can occur by either of two processes, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). A-type lamins promote genetic stability by maintaining levels of proteins that have key roles in NHEJ and HR.[70] Mouse cells deficient for maturation of prelamin A show increased DNA damage and chromosome aberrations and have increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.[19] In progeria, the inability to adequately repair DNA damages due to defective A-type lamin may cause aspects of premature aging[71] (also see DNA damage theory of aging).\n\nFibroblast samples from children with progeria syndrome exhibit accelerated epigenetic aging effects according to the epigenetic clock for skin and blood samples.[72]\n\nProgeria was first described in 1886 by Jonathan Hutchinson.[73] It was also described independently in 1897 by Hastings Gilford.[74] The condition was later named Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome. Scientists are interested in progeria partly because it might reveal clues about the normal process of aging.[75][64][76]\n\nThe word progeria comes from the Greek words pro (πρό) 'before, premature', and gēras (γῆρας), 'old age'.[77]\n\nYan Hui, a student of Confucius, aged rapidly and died at a young age, appearing as an old man by his late 20s. He may be one of the earliest potential examples of progeria in history.[78][failed verification] In 1987, fifteen-year-old Mickey Hays, who had progeria, appeared along with Jack Elam in the documentary I Am Not a Freak.[79] Elam and Hays first met during the filming of the 1986 film The Aurora Encounter,[80] in which Hays was cast as an alien. The friendship that developed lasted until Hays died in 1992, on his 20th birthday. Elam said, \"You know I've met a lot of people, but I've never met anybody that got next to me like Mickey.\"[This quote needs a citation]\n\nHarold Kushner, who among other things wrote the book When Bad Things Happen to Good People, had a son, Aaron, who died at the age of 14 in 1977 of progeria.[81] Margaret Casey, a 29-year-old woman with progeria who was then believed to be the oldest survivor of the premature aging disease, died on Sunday, May 26, 1985. Casey, a freelance artist, was admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital on the night of May 25 with respiratory problems, which caused her death.[82] Sam Berns was an American activist with the disease. He was the subject of the HBO documentary Life According to Sam. Berns also gave a TEDx talk titled \"My Philosophy for a Happy Life\" on December 13, 2013.[83]\n\nHayley Okines was an English progeria patient who spread awareness of the condition.[84] Leon Botha, the South African painter and DJ who was known, among other things, for his work with the hip-hop duo Die Antwoord, lived with progeria.[85] He died in 2011, aged 26. Tiffany Wedekind of Columbus, Ohio, is believed to be the oldest survivor of progeria at 44 years old as of September 2022.[86] Alexandra Peraut is a Catalan girl with progeria; she has inspired the book Una nena entre vint milions ('A girl in 20 million'), a children's book to explain progeria to youngsters.[87][88] Adalia Rose Williams, born December 10, 2006, was an American girl with progeria, who was a notable YouTuber and vlogger who shared her everyday life on social media. She died on January 12, 2022, at the age of 15.[89]\n\nAmy Foose, born September 12, 1969, was an American girl with progeria, who died at the age of 16 on December 19, 1985. [90] Sister of American automobile designer, artist, and TV star, Chip Foose, who started a foundation in her name called Amy's Depot. [91] The Progeria Research Foundation gives out The Amy Award every few years, in honor of Amy. [92]\n\nSammy Basso, born December 1, 1995, was an Italian biologist, activist and writer who studied progeria and campaigned to raise awareness of the disease, died at the age of 28 on October 5, 2024. At the time of his death he was the longest-living survivor of the condition.[93][94]\n• None Legge J (2009). The Confucian Analects, the Great Learning & the Doctrine of the Mean. Cosimo, Inc. p. 113. ISBN .Progeria - Symptoms and causes: Progeria (pro-JEER-e-uh), also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, is an extremely rare, progressive genetic disorder. It causes children to age rapidly, starting in their first two years of life.\n\nChildren with progeria generally appear healthy at birth. During the first year, symptoms such as slowed growth, loss of fat tissue and hair loss begin to appear.\n\nHeart problems or strokes are the eventual cause of death in most children with progeria. The average life expectancy for a child with progeria is about 15 years. Some with the condition may die younger and others may live longer, even to about 20 years.\n\nThere's no cure for progeria, but new treatments and research show some promise for managing symptoms and complications.\n\nUsually within the first year of life, you'll notice that your child's growth has slowed. But motor development and intelligence are not affected.\n\nSymptoms of this progressive disorder cause a distinctive appearance. They include:\n• Slowed growth and poor weight gain, with below-average height and weight.\n• Lack of fat that's stored just beneath the skin.\n• Head that is large compared with the face.\n• Thin, curved nose with a slight hook at the end, which may look like a bird's beak.\n• Veins easily seen through the skin.\n• Severe progressive heart and blood vessel disease, also known as cardiovascular disease.\n• Delayed tooth formation and tooth shape that is not usual.\n• Loss of fat under the skin and loss of muscle.\n• Problems with the growth and development of bones.\n• A hip that's forced out of the correct position, known as hip dislocation.\n• Insulin resistance, which means the body doesn't respond well to insulin made by an organ called the pancreas.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nProgeria is usually found in infancy or early childhood. This often happens at regular checkups, when a baby first shows the distinctive signs of premature aging.\n\nIf you notice changes in your child that could be symptoms of progeria, or you have any concerns about your child's growth or development, make an appointment with your child's health care provider.\n\nA change in one gene causes progeria. This gene, known as lamin A (LMNA), makes a protein that's needed to hold the center of a cell, called the nucleus, together. When the gene has a change, a flawed lamin A protein called progerin is made. Progerin makes cells unstable and appears to lead to progeria's aging process.\n\nThe changed gene that causes progeria is rarely passed down in families. In most cases, the rare gene change that causes progeria happens by chance.\n\nThere are other syndromes that may include problems with progerin-like proteins. These conditions are called progeroid syndromes. The changed genes that cause these syndromes are passed down in families. They cause rapid aging and a shortened life span:\n• Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch syndrome, also known as neonatal progeroid syndrome, starts in the womb, with symptoms of aging apparent at birth.\n• Werner syndrome, also known as adult progeria, begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It causes premature aging and conditions more common in old age, such as cataracts and diabetes.\n\nThere are no known factors, such as lifestyle or environmental issues, that increase the risk of having progeria or giving birth to a child with progeria. But the age of the father has been described as a possible risk factor. Progeria is extremely rare. If you've had one child with progeria, the chances of having a second child with progeria are slightly higher than the general population but are still low.\n\nIf you have a child with progeria, a genetic counselor can give you information about the risk of having other children with progeria.\n\nSevere hardening of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis, is common in progeria. Arteries are blood vessels that carry nutrients and oxygen from the heart to the rest of the body. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which the walls of the arteries stiffen and thicken. This often limits blood flow. The condition especially affects arteries in the heart and brain.\n\nMost children with progeria die of complications related to atherosclerosis, including:\n• Problems with blood vessels that supply the heart, resulting in heart attack and congestive heart failure.\n• Problems with blood vessels that supply the brain, resulting in stroke.\n\nOther health problems frequently linked with aging — such as an increased cancer risk — usually don't develop as part of progeria.Progeria (Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome — HGPS): Symptoms & Causes: Progeria is an extremely rare genetic disease that causes rapid aging in children. Newborns with the disorder appear to be healthy at birth but usually start to show signs of premature aging during their first one to two years of life. Their growth rate slows and they don’t gain weight as expected. Children with the condition have typical intelligence. However, their rapid aging causes distinct physical characteristics, including:\n• Loss of fat under the skin.\n\nProgeria gets its name from the Greek word “geras,” which means, “old age.” The classic type of progeria is called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, or HGPS. Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson and Dr. Hastings Gilford originally described the disease in the late 1800s.\n\nProgeria is always fatal. The average age of death is 14.5 years, although some adults with progeria will live into their early 20s. A drug called lonafarnib has been shown to slow down the progression of the disease.\n\nDeath most often occurs as a result of complications of severe atherosclerosis. This is the same heart disease that affects millions of typically aging adults but at a much younger age. Atherosclerosis occurs when plaque builds up within the walls of your arteries. This makes them less elastic and therefore, stiffer. Complications can lead to heart attack or stroke.\n\nProgeria is a rare genetic condition that can affect anyone. It most often occurs as a result of a new (de novo) genetic mutation. This means there’s no biological family history of the disorder.\n\nProgeria is extremely rare. It occurs in 1 in every 4 million live births worldwide. About 400 children and young adults around the world currently live with progeria.Progeria - Síntomas y causas - Mayo Clinic: La progeria, también conocida como síndrome de progeria de Hutchinson-Gilford, es un trastorno genético progresivo extremadamente raro. Provoca una aceleración del envejecimiento de los niños a partir de los primeros dos años de vida.\n\nLos niños con progeria suelen parecer sanos cuando nacen. Durante el primer año, empiezan a aparecer síntomas como el crecimiento lento, la pérdida de tejido adiposo y la caída del pelo.\n\nLos problemas cardíacos o los accidentes cerebrovasculares son las causas finales de muerte en la mayoría de los niños que padecen progeria. La expectativa de vida media de un niño con progeria es de unos 15 años. Algunas personas con la enfermedad pueden morir más jóvenes y otras vivir más tiempo, incluso hasta los 20 años.\n\nLa progeria no tiene cura, pero los nuevos tratamientos e investigaciones son prometedores para controlar los síntomas y las complicaciones.\n\nPor lo general, durante el primer año de vida, notarás que el crecimiento de tu hijo es más lento. Sin embargo, el desarrollo motor y la inteligencia no se ven afectados.\n\nLos síntomas de este trastorno progresivo causan una apariencia característica. Entre estos, se incluyen los siguientes:\n• Crecimiento lento y escaso aumento de peso, con una estatura y un peso por debajo de la media.\n• Escasez de la grasa que se almacena justo debajo de la piel.\n• Cabeza grande en comparación con la cara.\n• Nariz fina y curvada, con la punta ligeramente en gancho, que puede parecer el pico de un pájaro.\n• Ojos grandes y párpados que no se cierran por completo.\n• Caída del pelo, incluso de pestañas y cejas.\n• Venas fácilmente visibles a través de la piel.\n\nLos síntomas también incluyen problemas de salud:\n• Enfermedad grave y progresiva del corazón y los vasos sanguíneos, también conocida como enfermedad cardiovascular.\n• Endurecimiento y tirantez de la piel.\n• Retraso en la formación de los dientes y forma de los dientes inusual.\n• Pérdida de grasa debajo de la piel y pérdida de músculo.\n• Problemas de crecimiento y desarrollo de los huesos.\n• Problemas articulares, como rigidez en las articulaciones.\n• Cadera desplazada de su posición correcta, lo que se conoce como dislocación de cadera.\n• No hay progresión significativa de la pubertad.\n• Resistencia a la insulina, lo que significa que el organismo no responde bien a la insulina producida por un órgano llamado páncreas.\n\nLa progeria suele aparecer en la infancia o en los primeros años de la niñez. A menudo se detecta en las revisiones periódicas, cuando el bebé muestra por primera vez los signos distintivos del envejecimiento prematuro.\n\nSi notas cambios en tu hijo que podrían ser síntomas de progeria o tienes alguna duda sobre su crecimiento o desarrollo, pide cita con el pediatra.\n\nUn cambio en un gen causa la progeria. Este gen, conocido como lamina A, produce una proteína necesaria para mantener unido el centro de la célula, llamado núcleo. Cuando el gen experimenta un cambio, se produce una proteína lamina A defectuosa llamada progerina. La progerina hace que las células sean inestables y se cree que deriva en el proceso de envejecimiento de la progeria.\n\nEl gen alterado que causa la progeria rara vez se transmite de padres a hijos. En la mayoría de los casos, el raro trastorno genético que causa la progeria se produce por azar.\n\nHay otros síndromes que pueden incluir problemas con las proteínas similares a la progerina. Estas afecciones se denominan síndromes progeroides. Los genes alterados que causan estos síndromes se transmiten de padres a hijos. Provocan un envejecimiento rápido y una expectativa de vida más corta:\n• El síndrome Wiedemann-Rautenstrauch, también denominado síndrome progeroide neonatal, comienza en el útero, con síntomas de envejecimiento aparente en el nacimiento.\n• El síndrome Werner, también denominado progeria del adulto, comienza en la adolescencia o al principio de la edad adulta. Provoca el envejecimiento prematuro y afecciones más comunes en edades avanzadas como las cataratas o la diabetes.\n\nNo se conocen factores, como el estilo de vida o el entorno, que aumenten el riesgo de padecer progeria o de dar a luz a un niño con progeria. Sin embargo, la edad del padre se ha descrito como un posible factor de riesgo. La progeria es muy poco frecuente. Si has tenido un hijo con progeria, las probabilidades de tener un segundo hijo con progeria son ligeramente superiores a las de la población general, pero siguen siendo bajas.\n\nSi tienes un hijo con progeria, un consejero genético puede darte información sobre el riesgo de tener otros hijos con progeria.\n\nLa progeria se caracteriza por un endurecimiento grave de las arterias, conocido como aterosclerosis. Las arterias son vasos sanguíneos que transportan nutrientes y oxígeno desde el corazón al resto del cuerpo. La aterosclerosis es una enfermedad en la que las paredes de las arterias se endurecen y se hacen más gruesas, lo que a menudo limita el flujo sanguíneo. Esta enfermedad afecta sobre todo a las arterias del corazón y el cerebro.\n\nLa mayoría de los niños con progeria mueren por complicaciones relacionadas con la ateroesclerosis, como:\n• Problemas con los vasos sanguíneos que irrigan el corazón, lo que provoca ataques cardíacos e insuficiencia cardíaca congestiva.\n• Problemas con los vasos sanguíneos que irrigan el cerebro, lo que provoca accidentes cerebrovasculares.\n\nOtros problemas de salud que suelen estar relacionados con el envejecimiento, como un mayor riesgo de cáncer, normalmente no se desarrollan como consecuencia de la progeria."}

He worked for The Texas Company at Beacon, New York during the wartime, followed by a position in the Clinton Laboratory (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), and finally joined MIT in 1955, and retired in 1986.\n\nHe died on March 31, 2001, at the age 85.\n\nClifford G. Shull was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian Bertram Brockhouse.[1] The two won the prize for the development of the neutron scattering technique. He also conducted research on condensed matter. Professor Shull's prize was awarded for his pioneering work in neutron scattering, a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.\n\nWhen a beam of neutrons is directed at a given material, the neutrons bounce off, or are scattered by, atoms in the sample being investigated. The neutrons' directions change, depending on the location of the atoms they hit, and a diffraction pattern of the atoms' positions can then be obtained. Understanding where atoms are in a material and how they interact with one another is the key to understanding a material's properties.\n\n\"Then we can think of how we can make better window glass, better semiconductors, better microphones. All of these things go back to understanding the basic science behind their operation,\" Professor Shull, then 79, said on the day of the Nobel announcement. ...\n\nHe started [his pioneering work] in 1946 at what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At that time, he said, \"Scientists at Oak Ridge were very anxious to find real honest-to-goodness scientific uses for the information and technology that had been developed during the war at Oak Ridge and at other places associated with the wartime Manhattan Project.\"\n\nProfessor Shull teamed up with Ernest Wollan, and for the next nine years they explored ways of using the neutrons produced by nuclear reactors to probe the atomic structure of materials.\n\nIn Professor Shull's opinion the most important problem he worked on at the time dealt with determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in materials.\n\n\"Hydrogen atoms are ubiquitous in all biological materials and in many other inorganic materials,\" he once [when?] said, \"but you couldn't see them with other techniques. With neutrons it turned out that that was completely different, and we were very pleased and happy to find that we could learn things about hydrogen-containing structures.\"\n\nAs he refined the scattering technique, Professor Shull studied the fundamental properties of the neutron itself. He also initiated the first neutron diffraction investigations of magnetic materials. ... \"If there is a ... 'Father of Neutron Scattering' in the United States, it is Professor Shull,\" wrote Anthony Nunes ..., professor of physics at the University of Rhode Island. ...\n\nProfessor Shull came to MIT as a full professor in 1955 and retired in 1986, though he continued to visit and to \"look over the shoulders\" of students doing experiments in the \"remnants of my old research laboratory.\"\n\nProfessor Shull's awards include the Buckley Prize, which he received from the American Physical Society in 1956, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1956) and to the National Academy of Sciences (1975).

Shull, in the section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, known as Glenwood, which obviously relates to their selection of my middle name. I was preceded by an older sister, Evalyn May, and an older brother, Perry Leo, so that I grew up as the baby in the family. Both my father and mother had origins in rural, central Pennsylvania, in farming sections of Perry County. After moving with his then family to the big city, Pittsburgh, my father started a small business that evolved into a hardware store and an associated home repair service.\n\nMy early years of growth were entirely normal and happy ones and I had the usual collection of friends and buddies, who were often seen on the ball field or on roller skates. Grade schooling was nearby, a few blocks from our home, and this led later on to junior high school in the adjoining Hazelwood section but still within walking distance of our home. Following this, I had decided to go to Schenley High School for the remaining three years of school work and this required a more troublesome commute of 45 minutes by public street car. My first interest in physics as a career speciality came during my senior year at Schenley when I took the physics course taught by Paul Dysart. Somewhat older than the usual high school teacher and with a PhD degree in his background, he was a very impressive teacher who delighted in demonstrations from his laboratory and in explaining the principles behind them. Thereafter my original interest in aeronautical engineering was in heavy competition with physical science.\n\nIt seemed natural, in view of limited family financial straights, that I should continue into college study by living at home and commuting to the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). Carnegie Tech was also located in the Schenley Park district of Pittsburgh so that essentially the same commute was called for and it offered good, reputable curricula in the engineering and physical sciences. I was pleased when offered admission to the fall term of 1933 and particularly so when given a half-tuition scholarship in view of my good high school record. Once there, my interest in physics as a major subject sharpened quckly, helped along no doubt by the brilliant lectures in my freshman physics course given by Harry Hower, the chairman of the Physics Department. Hower was more aptly labeled an optical and illuminating engineer than a physicist, because of his extensive consulting activities in coastal lighthouse lens design and other architectural problems, but his lectures were delightful, inspiring and not often-to-be-missed by his students.\n\nShortly after my admission at Carnegie Tech, a family crisis developed when my father died unexpectedly in January, 1934. By this time, my sister had married and, with her husband, were living at home along with my brother (who had just finished college as an art major), my mother and myseelf. My brother decided to forego his art teaching and operate my father’s business and this continued until I had finished Carnegie Tech in 1937. The four years spent there were entirely pleasurable ones, in spite of the time-consuming commute, and I enjoyed the association with my fellow students and professors in the department. I was able to work in the summer periods at jobs both on and off campus and this helped to meet my rather minimal expenses during the year. Among the professors, I valued very much the friendly encouragement and counsel offered by Emerson Pugh during my junior and senior years, leading to my continuance into graduate school at New York University in the fall of 1937.\n\nNew York University was then a very large university, perhaps the largest in the nation, with several distributed, more or less autonomous, campuses. I was located with the Physics Department at the University Heights campus in the upper Bronx section of New York City and my teaching assistantship provided living subsistence, teaching meaning laboratory course help and problem assignment grading. We graduate students were encouraged at an early stage to join and help in one of the half dozen or so ongoing research projects within the department. I became associated with a nuclear physics group headed by Frank Myers and Robert Huntoon, who were in the process of building a 200 keV Cockcroft-Walton generator for accelerating deuterons. Much valuable experience was obtained with this exposure by Craig Crenshaw, another graduate student, and myself and we were able to help in the initial experiment with this accelerator, a study of the D-D nuclear reaction.\n\nDuring the third year of my graduate study, the Department decided that it could support the construction of a new 400 keV Van de Graaff generator to be used for accelerating electrons. Frank Myers took on this responsibility with me as his assistant and the thought that it could be used to repeat the electron-double-scattering (EDS) experiment as a possible thesis topic for me. This EDS type of experiment loomed important at the time because it was considered a direct test that electrons have a spin or polarization. Several earlier experiments had given either negative or inconclusive results and it seemed worthwhile that the experiment be performed again under new conditions. The construction and testing of the new facility went smoothly and I turned to getting ready for my thesis EDS experiment. By this time, Frank Myers had decided to take his overdue sabbatical leave with Robert Van de Graaff at MIT. I was fortunate in getting Richard Cox, a senior professor in the department, to supervise and offer expert and friendly advice on my efforts. Finally after four months of data collection and analysis, the experiment was successful and I was able to prepare a thesis and take my PhD degree in June 1941.\n\nAmong the other research programs being pursued by the NYU department was the study of neutron interactions with materials as started by Alan Mitchell and carried on by Martin Whitaker. Using a Ra-Be neutron source surrounded by a paraffin howitzer, a modest beam of thermalized neutrons was available for experimentation and, during my period at the Heights, this was directed towards a search for the expected paramagnetic scattering from certain materials. Theoretical prediction of this had been given by O. Halpern and M. Johnson and their students in the Department. I was familiar with this problem through my contemporary graduate student William Bright who worked with Whitaker on the experiment and indeed found myself working on the same problem a decade later.\n\nI have neglected to mention an important event that occurred in my first year in New York City. Through my good friend Craig Crenshaw, I was introduced to a young lady, Martha-Nuel Summer, who had recently come from South Carolina to the graduate school at Columbia University to study early American History. Our friendship flourished during the years of our professional studies and we married shortly after I took my degree and had a job in waiting. She has remained my loving companion to the present and along the way we have been favored by three fine sons, John, Robert and William, who have beautiful families of their own.\n\nI had arranged for a position at Beacon, NY with the research laboratory of The Texas Company, and Martha and I set up housekeeping there in July 1941. This laboratory addressed problems associated with the production and use of petroleum fuels and lubricants and included a small group of physicists. I was asked to study the microstructure of catalysts using gas adsorption and x-ray diffraction and scattering as tools for characterizing the physical structure of these materials. These catalysts were used in the production of high-performance aviation fuel and this area of investigation became increasingly important after the US entry in the World War in December 1941. Of singular significance to the scientific community in the first year of our wartime activity was the growth of the Manhattan Project dealing with the development of an atomic weapon. Many scientists had been drawn into this, including a number of my old colleagues and professors from graduate school. I was encouraged to join them and would have done so except that The Texas Company would not agree to my wartime job change. The matter was finally settled in their favor by an adjudication hearing at an area manpower board and I stayed in Beacon through the war years.\n\nMy work at Beacon was interesting and challenging and gave me the opportunity of learning things about diffraction processes, crystallography and the new field of solid state physics. Through visits and early meetings of the American Society for X-ray and Electron Diffraction, I was able to know established personages such as Warren, Buerger, Fankuchen, Zachariasen, Ewald, Harker, Gingrich and Donnay. Once the war was over, my interest in participating in the exciting new developments in nuclear physics within the Manhattan Project returned, and I paid a visit to the Clinton Laboratory (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in Tennessee. The activity there fascinated me very much and I convinced Martha that we should move there, which we did in June 1946 along with our one and a half year old son.\n\nIt was arranged that I would work with Ernest Wollan, who had been at the Laboratory since its formation during the war period and who had just assembled a rudimentary two-axis spectrometer for obtaining neutron diffraction patterns of crystals and materials. Wollan had shown me his first powder diffraction pattern on my earlier visit and I was delighted to be able to join him in exploring how neutron patterns could be used to supplement those obtained with x-rays or electrons. Our collaboration on common problems was to continue for nearly a decade until I left Oak Ridge in 1955 for academic life at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I regret very much that Wollan’s death in 1984 precluded his sharing in the Nobel honor that has been given to Brockhouse and me since his contributions were certainly deserving of recognition.\n\nI was attracted to MIT by the prospects of teaching and of training graduate research students at the soon-to-be-completed MITR-I research reactor on campus. This reactor was among the early group of condensed volume reactors using isotopically enriched fuel which were being explored in that period. Together with occasional post-doctoral students and a regular flow of graduate thesis students, our group carried on investigations using neutron radiation from this reactor in many fields until my retirement from MIT in 1986. These studies included: internal magnetization in crystals, development of polarized beam technology, dynamical scattering in perfect crystals, interferometry, and fundamental properties of the neutron. The opportunity of being at MIT with its fine faculty and excellent students has certainly been most stimulating and satisfying.\n\nThis autobiography/biography was written at the time of the award and later published in the book series Les Prix Nobel/ Nobel Lectures/The Nobel Prizes.

Shull, co-winner of 1994 Nobel Prize in physics, is dead at 85: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- MIT Professor Emeritus Clifford G. Shull, co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1994, died on March 31 at Lawrence Memorial Hospital in Medford, MA, following a brief illness. Professor Shull was 85 and lived in Lexington, MA.\n\nProfessor Shull shared the 1994 Nobel Prize with Professor Bertram S. Brockhouse of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.\n\n\"Clifford G. Shull has helped answer the question of where atoms 'are' and Bertram N. Brockhouse, the question of what atoms 'do,'\" the Nobel citation said.\n\nProfessor Shull's prize was awarded for his pioneering work in neutron scattering, a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.\n\nWhen a beam of neutrons is directed at a given material, the neutrons bounce off, or are scattered by, atoms in the sample being investigated.

All of these things go back to understanding the basic science behind their operation,\" Professor Shull, then 79, said on the day of the Nobel announcement.\n\nThe Nobel citation noted that thousands of people now work in the field of neutron scattering, using the technology to study ceramic superconductors, the structure of viruses, surfaces of relevance to catalytic exhaust cleaning, and more.\n\nUniversity of Toronto President and former MIT Dean of Science Robert J. Birgeneau said in 1994 of the two Nobel winners, \"Thermal neutron scattering has proven to be the most important single technique for elucidating the structure and dynamics of solids and fluids. Professors Shull and Brockhouse have made singular contributions which provide the essential foundations of the field.\"\n\nProfessor Shull's pioneering work on neutron diffraction began about 50 years before he became a Nobel winner.\n\nHe started in 1946 at what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At that time, he said, \"Scientists at Oak Ridge were very anxious to find real honest-to-goodness scientific uses for the information and technology that had been developed during the war at Oak Ridge and at other places associated with the wartime Manhattan Project.\"\n\nProfessor Shull teamed up with the late Ernest Wollan, and for the next nine years they explored ways of using the neutrons produced by nuclear reactors to probe the atomic structure of materials.\n\nIn Professor Shull's opinion the most important problem he worked on at the time dealt with determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in materials.\n\n\"Hydrogen atoms are ubiquitous in all biological materials and in many other inorganic materials,\" he once said, \"but you couldn't see them with other techniques. With neutrons it turned out that that was completely different, and we were very pleased and happy to find that we could learn things about hydrogen-containing structures.\"\n\nAs he refined the scattering technique, Professor Shull studied the fundamental properties of the neutron itself. He also initiated the first neutron diffraction investigations of magnetic materials. This yielded information about the magnetic properties of materials at the atomic level, opening up an entirely new field of study.\n\n\"If there is a 'Central Clearing House for Thermal Neutron Physics,' or a 'Father of Neutron Scattering' in the United States, it is Professor Shull,\" wrote Anthony Nunes (MIT PhD 1969), professor of physics at the University of Rhode Island of Professor Shull, in a biographical article published in 1986. Professor Shull was Nunes' thesis advisor at MIT.\n\nIn his 1986 article, published in Physica, Professor Nunes went on to note that Professor Shull's \"abilities as an experimental physicist are amplified and extended by his completely candid relations with coworkers\" who \"find him to be modest to a fault. He is very careful to 'give credit where credit is due,' usually citing originators of ideas even in casual conversation.\"\n\n\"I consider the intellectual stimulation, the unending optimism and the simple scientific fun of my student years with this man to be priceless,\" concluded Professor Nunes.\n\nProfessor Shull was the fourth member of the MIT physics faculty to receive the Nobel Prize in physics and the 15th present or former faculty member to receive a Nobel Prize. One staff member and 11 alumni also have won Nobels.\n\nProfessor Shull came to MIT as a full professor in 1955 and retired in 1986, though he continued to visit and to \"look over the shoulders\" of students doing experiments in the \"remnants of my old research laboratory.\"\n\nCommenting on his life at MIT, Professor Shull wrote, \"I was attracted to MIT by the prospects of teaching and of training graduate research students at the soon-to-be-completed MITR-I research reactor on campus. The opportunity of being at MIT with its fine faculty and excellent students has certainly been most stimulating and satisfying.\"\n\nProfessor Shull's awards include the Buckley Prize, which he received from the American Physical Society in 1956, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1956) and to the National Academy of Sciences (1975). In 1993 he received the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences' Gregori Aminoff prize for his \"development and application of neutron diffraction methods for studies of atomic and magnetic structures of solids.\"\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, PA, in 1915, Professor Shull graduated from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh then received his BS from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1937. He entered Carnegie Tech to study aeronautical engineering, but after six months found himself drawn to physics. He received the PhD from New York University (NYU) in 1941.\n\nHe was a teaching assistant at NYU from 1937 to 1941, a research physicist with the Texas Company (now Texaco) in Beacon, NY, from 1941-46, and a research physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1946-55.\n\nHis hobbies included stamp collecting, camping, hiking, coin collecting, model trains and golf, said his son Robert D. Shull (MIT 1968 SB).\n\nProfessor Shull is survived by his wife of 60 years, Martha-Nuel Summer; three sons: John C. of Texas, Robert D. of Maryland, and William F. Shull of South Carolina; and five grandchildren. One grandson, Craig M. Shull, received the SB degree in mechanical engineering from MIT in 1996.\n\nA Memorial Service for Professor Shull will be held on Friday, April 6, from 1:30-3pm in the MIT Chapel at MIT, with a reception following the service in the Physics Reading Room at MIT, Building 26-152, from 3-4pm.\n\nOther arrangements are being made through the Douglass Funeral Home, Worthen Road, Lexington, MA.The Nobel Prize in Physics 1994: Six prizes were awarded for achievements that have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind. The 12 laureates' work and discoveries range from proteins' structures and machine learning to fighting for a world free of nuclear weapons.\n\nSee them all presented here.Shull and Wollan, neutron pioneers « ORNL and the Nobel Prize: Neutron scattering grew from the nuclear science of the Manhattan Project during the 1940s at what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\n\nIn 1942, the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved at the University of Chicago, in a reactor described by physicist Enrico Fermi as “a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers.”\n\nIn attendance was physicist Ernest Wollan, who traveled a year later to ORNL—then known as Clinton Laboratories—to witness the start-up of the X-10 Graphite Reactor.\n\nWollan soon moved to Oak Ridge to begin work at the one-of-a-kind facility, which was the first nuclear reactor built for continuous operation, 1,000 times more powerful than Fermi’s Chicago Pile-1. During the Manhattan Project, he studied the use of neutrons to measure nuclear materials. That experience, along with his background in x-ray scattering, quickly led him to realize the potential neutrons held as a powerful new method for studying a much wider range of materials.\n\n“That particle called the neutron became my absorbing interest,” Wollan said at the time.\n\nAs rumor has it, Wollan left Chicago in the dark of night with an x-ray diffractometer that he would later retrofit to become the world’s first neutron scattering instrument.\n\nIn 1944, he wrote a research proposal asking for funding to use the equipment he brought with him from Chicago to measure the diffraction of neutrons using single crystals, identifying an opening in the reactor in which the work could be done.\n\nHis proposal was accepted, and shortly thereafter Wollan successfully made the first powder diffraction measurements recorded using neutrons.\n\nThe many firsts of Shull and Wollan, neutron pioneers\n\nIn 1946, impressed by Wollan’s results, physicist Clifford Shull accepted his colleague’s invitation to work alongside him at the Graphite Reactor to further develop the technique. Shull’s addition had a profound and immediate impact, so much so that he would later be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1994 for his contributions to the field. In his acceptance speech, Shull expressed his regret that Wollan had not lived to share the award. (Bertram N. Brockhouse shared the prize with Shull. For information on his work on the development of neutron spectroscopy and other advances, see the Award ceremony speech for the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics.)\n\nTheir collaborations quickly led to the construction of the first instrument exclusively for neutron scattering—the double-crystal neutron spectrometer—as well as the adaptation of automated data recording, which took the place of pen and paper and allowed researchers to collect data overnight.\n\nBy 1955, the two pioneers had measured scattering patterns from more than 100 elements and 60 different isotopes. A prolific class of successors emerged who would continue to push the field forward and, in turn, mentor what is the present-day neutron scattering workforce. —Jeremy Rumsey"}

Her compositions include songs, works for piano, chamber music, orchestral works, choral works and operas.\n\nSmyth tended to be marginalised as a \"woman composer\", as though her work could not be accepted as mainstream.[2] Yet when she produced more delicate compositions, they were criticised for not measuring up to the standard of her male peers. She was the first female composer granted a damehood.\n\nEthel Smyth was born in Sidcup, Kent, which is now in the London Borough of Bexley, on 22 April 1858, the fourth of eight children. While 22 April is the actual date of her birth, Smyth habitually stated it was 23 April, the day that was celebrated by her family, as they enjoyed the coincidence with William Shakespeare's.[3] Her father, John Hall Smyth, who was a major general in the Royal Artillery, was very much opposed to her making a career in music.[2] She lived at Frimhurst, near Frimley Green[4] for many years, before moving to Hook Heath on the outskirts of Woking. Her youngest brother was Robert (\"Bob\") Napier Smyth (1868–1947), who rose to become a Brigadier in the British Army. She was the aunt of Lieutenant General Sir Ralph Eastwood.\n\nSmyth was a child prodigy. She was a stellar pianist at a very young age and was able to compose her first hymn by the age of 10. She decided to study music at the age of 12.[5] Smyth first studied with Alexander Ewing when she was 17. He introduced her to the music of Wagner and Berlioz. After a major battle with her father about her plans to devote her life to music, Smyth was allowed to advance her musical education at the Leipzig Conservatory, where she studied Brahmsian musical[6] composition with Carl Reinecke. She left after a year, however, disillusioned with the low standard of teaching, and continued her music studies privately with Heinrich von Herzogenberg.[2] While at the Leipzig Conservatory, Smyth met Dvořák, Grieg and Tchaikovsky. Through Herzogenberg, she also met Clara Schumann and Brahms.[2] Upon her return to England, Smyth formed a supportive friendship with Arthur Sullivan in the last years of his life; he respected her and encouraged her work.\n\nSmyth's extensive body of work includes the Concerto for Violin, Horn and Orchestra and the Mass in D. It was the latter's performance in London's Albert Hall in 1893 that helped her gain recognition as a serious composer. Her opera The Wreckers is considered by some critics to be the \"most important English opera composed during the period between Purcell and Britten\".[2] Her best known work, she composed it to a French libretto by Henry Brewster. It premiered in 1906. In 2022 it received its first professional production in its original French text at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera. It was also performed at the BBC Proms, where its prelude or overture was presented 27 times between 1913 and 1947.[7]\n\nAnother of her operas, Der Wald, mounted in 1903, was, for more than a century, the only opera by a woman composer ever produced at New York's Metropolitan Opera[2][8] (until Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin in December 2016).[9][10]\n\nOn 28 May 1928, the nascent BBC broadcast two concerts of Smyth's music, marking her \"musical jubilee\",[11][12][13] The first comprised chamber music,[12] the second, conducted by Smyth herself, choral works.[11][13] Otherwise, recognition in England came somewhat late for Smyth, wrote the conductor Leon Botstein at the time he conducted the American Symphony Orchestra's US premiere of The Wreckers in New York on 30 September 2007:[14]\n\nAfter her release from prison, Smyth composed her final major work, the hour-long vocal symphony The Prison, setting a text by Henry Bennett Brewster. It was first performed in 1931. The first recording was issued by Chandos in 2020.[15] Smyth’s composing and conducting career came to a premature end before the 1920s as she started to develop hearing loss, which eventually led to her becoming completely deaf.[1] However, she found a new interest in literature and, between 1919 and 1940, she published ten highly successful, mostly autobiographical, books.[2]\n\nOverall, critical reaction to her work was mixed. She was alternately praised and panned for writing music that was considered too masculine for a \"lady composer\", as critics called her.[16] Though Smyth’s four movement Serenade earned her orchestral and public debut in England, she had to change her name to the pseudonym E.M. Smith to avoid biased criticism.[17] Eugene Gates writes that:\n\nOther critics were more favourable: \"The composer is a learned musician: it is learning which gives her the power to express her natural inborn sense of humour... Dr. Smyth knows her Mozart and her Sullivan: she has learned how to write conversations in music... [The Boatswain's Mate] is one of the merriest, most tuneful, and most delightful comic operas ever put on the stage.\"[18]\n\nIn 1910, Smyth joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), which agitated for women's suffrage, giving up music for two years to devote herself to the cause. Smyth argued in her memoirs that the disadvantages that women face in music stems from the lack of a political vote or voice.[19] She developed a very close relationship with the charismatic leader of the WSPU, Emmeline Pankhurst, and accompanied her on many occasions.[20] Soon after, Smyth composed her most famous, \"The March of the Women\" (1911) to words by Cicely Hamilton. The text was used to inspire women to unite and free themselves from patriarchal rule.[21] This eventually became the anthem of the WSPU and the suffragette movement.\n\nSmyth is credited with teaching Emmeline Pankhurst how to throw stones in 1912.[22] After further practice aiming stones at trees near the home of fellow suffragette Zelie Emerson, Pankhurst called on WPSU members to break a window of the house of any politician who opposed votes for women. Smyth was one of the 109 members who responded to Pankhurst's call, asking to be sent to attack the home of Colonial Secretary Lewis Harcourt, who had remarked that if his wife's beauty and wisdom was present in all women, they would have already won the vote.[20]\n\nSmyth stood half the bail for Helen Craggs, who had been caught on the way to carry out the arson of the leading politician's home.[20] During the stone-throwing, Pankhurst and 100 other women were arrested, and Smyth served two months in Holloway Prison.[23][24] When Thomas Beecham, her proponent-friend, went to visit her there, he found suffragettes marching in the quadrangle and singing, as Smyth leaned out of a window conducting the song with a toothbrush.[25]\n\nIn her book, Female Pipings in Eden, Smyth said her prison experience was of being \"in good company\" of united women \"old, young, rich, poor, strong, delicate\", putting the cause they were imprisoned for before their personal needs. Smyth revealed that the prison was infested with cockroaches, even in the hospital ward. She was released early, due to a medical assessment that she was mentally unstable and hysterical. Smyth gave written evidence in the November trial of Pankhurst and others for inciting violence, stating that she (Smyth) had freely engaged in activism. She continued to correspond with Pankhurst, and heard of her getting lost trying to find the safe house provided for her to avoid re-arrest in Scotland.[20]\n\nSmyth strongly disagreed with the support Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel gave to the war effort in 1914, but she did train as a radiographer in Paris. Her fractious friendship with Christabel ended in 1925, and Smyth conducted the Metropolitan Police Band at the unveiling of the statue to Pankhurst in London in 1930.[20]\n\nSmyth had several passionate affairs, most of them with women. Smyth was at one time in love with the married suffragette Pankhurst. At the age of 71, she fell in love with writer Virginia Woolf – herself having worked in the women's suffrage movement[26] – who, both alarmed and amused, said it was \"like being caught by a giant crab\", but the two became friends.[23] Smyth's relationship with Violet Gordon-Woodhouse is depicted satirically in Roger Scruton's 2005 opera, Violet.\n\nHer philosopher-friend and the librettist of some of her operas, Henry Bennet Brewster, may have been her only male lover. She wrote to him in 1892: \"I wonder why it is so much easier for me to love my own sex more passionately than yours. I can't make it out, for I am a very healthy-minded person\".[27] She met Willie Wilde, the brother of Oscar Wilde, during a trip to Ireland. They became engaged on the return railway journey from Holyhead to Euston, but she broke it off within three weeks.[28]\n\nIn recognition of her work as a composer and writer, Smyth was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1922,[2][29] becoming the first female composer to be awarded a damehood.[30] Smyth received honorary doctorates in music from the universities of Durham and Oxford.[31] She died in Woking in 1944 at the age of 86.[32]\n\nSmyth was actively involved in sport throughout her life. In her youth, she was a keen horse-rider and tennis player. She was a passionate golfer and a member of the ladies' section of Woking Golf Club, near where she lived. After she died and was cremated, her ashes were, as she had requested, scattered in the woods neighbouring the club[31] by her brother Bob.[33] Her musical executor was the composer and musicologist Kathleen Dale, a close neighbour.[34]\n\nEthel Smyth featured, under the name of Edith Staines, in E. F. Benson's Dodo books (1893–1921), decades before the quaint musical characters of his more famous Mapp and Lucia series. She \"gleefully acknowledged\" the portrait, according to Prunella Scales.[35] She was later a model for the fictional Dame Hilda Tablet in the 1950s radio plays of Henry Reed.[36]\n\nShe was portrayed by Maureen Pryor in the 1974 BBC television film Shoulder to Shoulder.\n\nJudy Chicago's monumental work of feminist art, The Dinner Party, features a place setting for Smyth.[37]\n\nSince 2018, the actress and singer, Lucy Stevens, has portrayed Ethel Smyth on stage at various venues in Britain.[38]\n\nIn 2021, Smyth posthumously received a Grammy for Best Classical Vocal Solo based on the recording of The Prison by conductor James Blachly and soloists Sarah Brailey and Dashon Burton, members of Experiential Orchestra. Their rendition was released in August 2020 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in the United States.[2]\n\nIn March 2022, in recognition of International Women's Day, a larger-than-size statue by Christine Charlesworth of Smyth conducting was unveiled in Duke's Court Plaza, Woking,[39] by the Mayor of Woking, Cllr Liam Lyons, with invited guests who included members of Smyth's family as well as academics and councillors. Charlesworth described her sculpture as:\n• As Time Went On ... (1936)\n• The Memoirs of Ethel Smyth (1987), abridged and edited by Ronald Crichton.

But in recent years, there's been a revival of her work, and interest in her unstoppable personality. There have been performances in 2018 of Smyth's rousing suffragette anthem, The March of the Women – to mark the centenary of many women winning the right to vote – and a Grammy-award-winning recording of her 1930 opera The Prison. And crowning it all, her most impressive work, the opera The Wreckers, opened the prestigious Glyndebourne festival in May, to glowing reviews for, as the Times said, its \"wild waves of passion\". The opera will also be performed at this summer's Proms, with other of her compositions. Smyth is back in the limelight, just as she would have loved it.\n\nDr Amy Zigler, assistant professor of music at Salem College, has presented research on Smyth since 2005. \"The obvious answer is her gender,\" she says, in response to why Smyth might have been under-appreciated. \"In reviews of her music from the 1880s, 90s and early 1900s, at a time when she was building her career, there is almost always a comment about her gender.\" It was not only Smyth who suffered discrimination: \"For more than a century, the gatekeepers believed women weren't capable of writing music on a par with male composers.\". If Smyth and others wrote music that was \"energetic, loud, forceful or 'virile'\" it was damned as \"unnatural and unbecoming of a woman\" says Zigler. If they wrote music that was \"graceful, soft, lyrical or sentimental, it was deemed to be just 'parlour' music for young women to play at home – unimportant or inferior.\"\n\nBroad tells BBC Culture that Smyth \"had some very strong political views that she liked to hold court about… She was a staunch conservative, and held a number of opinions that, while popular in her day, are less so now.\" Broad told the Guardian that Smyth was “very much a woman of her time, in that she held problematic views about race, and subscribed to the then-popular belief in white English superiority.\" She may also have \"inadvertently made life harder for female musicians coming after her. Smyth certainly forced many of her critics to confront their own gender prejudices, but she did little to actively uplift or support other female composers.\" Still, Broad found her \"the most fun to write about\". She enjoyed the story of an interviewer who went to meet Smyth to find she had tied herself to a tree: \"She explained it was to help improve her posture as a conductor… she didn't have a sense of self-awareness like many other people.\"\n\nMusically, too, the opera was innovative for its time. Zigler tells BBC Culture: \"What makes The Wreckers so fascinating for me is the drama inherent in the music. Whether it's the love duet between Thurza and Mark in Act II, or the kangaroo court in Act III, Smyth creates tension through her melodic style and harmonic language, which, coupled with the orchestration, leaves the audience wondering what's going to happen next. At the heart of the score, too, is the French libretto; Smyth and Brewster collaborated on the opera, and she drew inspiration in part from the French text he created – not only what the words were saying but how they sounded, their rhythm and inflection. All of this combined creates an opera that is exciting.\"Ethel Smyth: Ethel Smyth was a twentieth-century British composer and a champion of women’s rights and female musicians. During her lifetime, she composed symphonies, choral works (musical pieces written for a choir), and operas including The Wreckers,1906, and is most well known for The March of Women, an anthem for the women’s suffrage movement. In 1922, she was named a Dame of the British Empire.\n\nShe studied Brahmsian musical composition (the romantic style of lyrical and classical music developed by the German composer Brahms) and music theory at Leipzig Conservatory in Germany beginning in 1877 and her sophisticated music elicited rave reviews. In 1889, she returned to London and developed talents in multiple areas of composition, culminating in an oeuvre that included orchestral pieces, choral arrangements, chamber music, and six operas. She earned acclaim for her performance of Mass in D, which was enthusiastically received in London in 1893. Despite this success and her immense talent, she struggled to find musicians to perform her works because she was a woman.\n\nIn 1910, Smyth met Emmeline Pankhurst, an ardent feminist, one of the founders of the British suffrage movement, and head of the Women’s Social and Political Union, a militant all-women’s activist group founded in 1903 that campaigned especially for women’s suffrage. Due, in part, to Pankhurst’s influence, Smyth took two years off from her music career to devote her time to women’s rights and suffrage activism. During this time, she wrote The March of Women, 1911, a piece that later became the battle cry for the British Women’s Movement. In 1912, Smyth and Pankhurst were arrested in London, along with 100 other suffragettes, for throwing stones at the houses of suffrage opponents; she was imprisoned for two months. While in Holloway prison, Smyth led the women in a rousing rendition of The March of Women, conducting them with her toothbrush, in what would become the most famous performance of the song.\n\nSmyth began to lose her hearing in 1912. After visiting an aural specialist in Paris, she went to Egypt, where she began work on The Boatswain’s Mate, a comic opera. This became one of the most revolutionary pieces she completed, due in part to her unorthodox style and method—the first half of the opera contained both words and music, but the second half was entirely instrumental. The Boatswain’s Mate, a more accessible and light-hearted piece for the general public, was partially in response to the Grand Opera style of the time, which emphasized splendor and sophistication.\n\nIn spite of several distinguished awards and recognitions, she continued to have difficulty getting her music published and performed because of her sex. She ultimately gave up her music career due to her increased hearing loss. Smyth wrote about her life in several biographies, Impressions that Remained, 1919, and the memoir Streaks of Life, 1921, which captured her experiences in music, activism, and as an open lesbian, discussing her romantic involvements with famous women of her time, including Lady Pauline Trevelyan; the Empress Eugénie; heiress Winnaretta Singer; Lady Mary Ponsonby; writer Edith Somerville; and writer, Virginia Woolf. Smyth died in England in 1944 at the age of 86. She remains a highly regarded female composer and a strong musical and political voice of the early twentieth century.The Life of Dame Ethel Smyth: Compositions & Music | ENO: Dame Ethel Mary Smyth was a ground-breaking English composer and suffragist whose remarkable career defied the societal norms of her time. Born into a privileged background, Smyth eschewed societal expectations to pursue her passion for music and women’s suffrage. In this guide, you can find out more about her music, compositions and her life…\n\nDiscover more about Ethel Smyth’s life and career, including her education and influences, background, career and key accomplishments. It will also cover her most notable works, along with her music in action.\n\nEthel Smyth was born on April 23, 1858, in Sidcup, Kent, England, into a prosperous military family. Her father, General J. H. P. Smyth, recognised her early musical talent and encouraged her pursuits, despite prevailing gender norms. Growing up in an environment of relative privilege, Smyth received piano lessons and developed a passion for music.\n\nIn her younger years, she defied societal expectations for a woman of her class, exhibiting a strong-willed character and a determination to pursue her artistic ambitions. Her family’s support allowed her to break away from conventional roles, paving the way for her journey into the world of music.\n\nIn 1877, she enrolled at the Leipzig Conservatory, studying under renowned composer Carl Reinecke and subsequently with Heinrich von Herzogenberg. These formative years in Germany exposed her to the flourishing musical scene and influenced her compositional style. Smyth’s education was foundational, shaping her into a skilled composer.\n\nReturning to England, Smyth’s career gained momentum with performances of her chamber and orchestral works. Notable achievements include her breakthrough work, Mass in D and the success of her first opera, Fantasio. Despite facing gender biases, Smyth persisted, earning acclaim for her compositions and carving a path for future female composers.\n\nSmyth’s youth was marked by a defiance of societal expectations, evident in her pursuit of music against gender norms. Her upbringing in a supportive environment, coupled with a determined spirit, laid the groundwork for an extraordinary career that transcended both musical and societal boundaries.\n\nEthel Smyth’s career was characterised by a prolific output, marked by innovative compositions and a passionate commitment to both music and societal change.\n\nSmyth gained recognition for her operatic works, with The Wreckers (1904) being one of her most acclaimed operas. Set in a Cornish village, the opera explores themes of morality and social issues. Smyth’s dynamic use of orchestration and dramatic storytelling contributed to its success. Perhaps Smyth’s most famous composition is The March of the Women (1910), which became a powerful anthem for the suffragette movement. Inspired by her experiences as a suffragist, the anthem’s rousing melody and lyrics captured the spirit of the women’s rights movement. Smyth’s contributions to orchestral and chamber music are noteworthy. Her Mass in D (1891) and Double Concerto for Violin and Horn (1927) showcase her mastery of composition and orchestration. The Mass, in particular, received critical acclaim for its grandeur and emotional depth.\n\nSmyth faced challenges as a woman in the male-dominated field of classical music. Her activism for women’s suffrage led to a two month prison sentence in 1912, an experience she captured in her book ‘Streaks of Life’ (1921), adding another layer to her public persona. Smyth associated with prominent figures of her time, including fellow composers like Clara Schumann and Johannes Brahms. Her friendship with suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst also influenced her political involvement.\n\nWhile Smyth’s career faced challenges due to gender bias, her resilience, musical talent, and dedication to social causes left an indelible mark on the history of classical music and women’s rights.\n\nIn her later years, Ethel Smyth continued to compose and contribute to the world of classical music. Smyth’s later works reflected her continued creativity and exploration of diverse musical forms. The Prison (1930), an oratorio, stands out as one of her final major compositions. This work explores philosophical and existential themes, showcasing Smyth’s ability to grapple with complex subject matter.\n\nAt the age of 71, Ethel Smyth met and fell in love with the writer Virginia Woolf, who was 25 years her junior. In her diaries, she wrote “I don’t think I have ever cared for anyone more profoundly”; in contrast, Virginia wrote in her own diary “an old woman has fallen in love with me. It’s like being caught by a giant crab.” However, despite their differences, the two women embarked on a powerful friendship which endured until Woolf’s death in 1941.\n\nDespite facing hearing loss as she aged, Smyth persisted in her musical pursuits. Her determination to overcome physical challenges and continue composing demonstrated her unwavering commitment to her craft. In addition to her musical contributions, Smyth penned her autobiography, ‘Streaks of Life’, published in 1921. The book provides insights into her personal and professional life, offering a first-hand account of her experiences as a composer and suffragist.\n\nShe spent her later years in Woking, Surrey and as her health declined, she still remained active in the cultural and political spheres. Despite physical limitations, she continued to engage with the world around her. Ethel passed away on May 8, 1944, at the age of 86. Her death marked the end of a pioneering career that spanned decades and left an indelible impact on the classical music landscape.\n\nSmyth’s legacy is multifaceted. As a composer, she played a crucial role in breaking gender barriers in classical music. Her works, characterised by a distinctive voice and innovative approaches, continue to be studied and performed. Smyth’s contributions to the suffragette movement further solidify her legacy as a pioneer for women’s rights. In recognition of her achievements, Smyth was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1922, highlighting her significant contributions to the arts.\n\nEthel Smyth’s legacy extends beyond her music, encompassing her role as a symbol of resilience, determination, and advocacy for women’s rights. Her impact on the classical music world and her pioneering spirit continue to inspire musicians and enthusiasts alike, underscoring the importance of her contributions to both art and social progress."}

She organised and led the Comet Line (Le Réseau Comète) to assist Allied soldiers and airmen to escape from Nazi-occupied Belgium. The airmen were survivors of military airplanes shot down over Belgium or other European countries. Between August 1941 and December 1942, she escorted 118 people, including more than 80 airmen, from Belgium to neutral Spain from where they were transported to the United Kingdom. Arrested by the Nazis in January 1943, she was incarcerated for the remainder of World War II. After the war, she worked in leper hospitals in Africa.\n\nDe Jongh was the recipient of the George Medal from the United Kingdom, the Medal of Freedom with golden palms from the United States, and many other medals for her work during World War II.[2] In 1985 she was made a countess by the king of Belgium. Her exploits were described in or inspired several books, movies, and television shows.\n\nAndrée or Dédée de Jongh was born in Schaerbeek in Belgium, then under German occupation during the First World War. She was the younger daughter of Frédéric de Jongh, the headmaster of a primary school and Alice Decarpentrie. Edith Cavell, a British nurse shot in the Tir national in Schaerbeek in 1915 for assisting troops to escape from occupied Belgium to the neutral Netherlands, was her heroine.\n\nShe trained as a nurse and became a commercial artist in Malmedy. Her nursing endeavours were inspired by Cavell. She was 23 years old when the Germans invaded and occupied Belgium. De Jongh was described by a British airman she helped as a \"frail young girl who appears twenty years [old], very pretty, pleasant, kind, cheerful, and simple. She seems to have the carelessness of a young student who would go on vacation after passing her exams\". Later, a British colonel would call her a \"pure heroine of legend\".[4]\n\nAfter German troops invaded and occupied Belgium in May 1940, de Jongh moved to Brussels, where she became a Red Cross volunteer, ministering to captured Allied troops. In Brussels at that time, hiding in safe houses, were many British soldiers, those left behind at Dunkirk and escapees from those captured at Saint-Valery-en-Caux. De Jongh organised a series of safe houses for these soldiers, while also procuring civilian clothes for them as well as false ID papers. Visiting the sick and wounded soldiers enabled her to make links with this network of safe-house keepers who were trying to work out ways to get the soldiers back to Britain.\n\nIn spring 1941, Henri de Bliqui, Arnold Deppè, and Andrée de Jongh organised a group of friends to help Allied soldiers and airmen escape occupied Belgium and return to Great Britain. This was the origin of what became known as the Comet Line, the largest of the escape and evasion lines in World War II. They initially called themselves the DDDs after their last names. De Bliqui was arrested in April 1941 and later executed after the group was infiltrated by Prosper Dezitter, a Belgian collaborator with the Germans.[5]\n\nIn June 1941, Deppé journeyed from Belgium to southwestern France where he had once lived to look for the means to smuggle Allied soldiers, downed airmen, and other people vulnerable to capture by the Germans out of Belgium.[6] Deppé made contact with Elvire de Greef and her family and arranged for their help in getting people across the border. De Greef became known as \"Tante Go\" (\"Auntie Go\").[7][8]\n\nDe Jongh and Deppé, assisted by the de Greefs, attempted their first crossing of the Spanish border in July 1941 with ten Belgians and \"Miss Richards,\" supposedly an English woman but actually a Belgian secret agent named Frederique Dupuich. After they successfully crossed the Pyrenees mountains on the Franco-Spanish border, de Jongh and Deppé left their charges to fend for themselves and returned to Belgium. The ten Belgians and \"Miss Richards\" were arrested by Spanish police. Three Belgian soldiers among them were turned over to the Germans in France. From this experience, de Jongh realised that in future exfiltrations they must establish a relationship with the British Consulate in Bilbao to ensure the safety in Spain of the people they escorted out of occupied Belgian and France.[9][10]\n\nIn August, Deppé and de Jongh escorted another group of people, de Jongh taking a longer, more rural, and safer route with three men, including a British soldier, and Deppé a shorter, more dangerous route with six men. An informer betrayed Deppé and his party and they were arrested by the Germans. Deppé was imprisoned for the remainder of the war.[11] De Jongh arrived safely at the de Greef house in Anglet and crossed into Spain with a Basque smuggler as a guide.[12] She appeared in the British consulate in Bilbao with a British soldier (James Cromar from Aberdeen) and two Belgian volunteers (Merchiers and Sterckmans), having travelled mostly by train from Brussels to Bayonne and then on foot over the Pyrenees through the Basque Country.\n\nThe British diplomats were initially sceptical of de Jongh. It seemed unlikely to them that this young woman with three soldiers in tow had travelled from German-occupied Belgium, through occupied France, and over the Pyrenees to Spain, a straight-line distance of some 800 kilometres (500 miles) (and much further by the roundabout route they had taken). De Jongh promised to exfiltrate additional British soldiers and airmen if the British would pay the Comet Line's expenses which were 6,000 Belgian Francs and 1,400 Spanish Pesetas (the sum of the two currencies amounting to the equivalent of $2,000 in 2018 U.S. dollars) for each Allied airmen or soldier exfiltrated. After three weeks of doubt, suspicion that she was a German agent, and indecision by British authorities in Spain and England, the British agreed to her terms. Except for financial assistance, de Jongh turned down all other British offers of advice and assistance. She rejected efforts by the British and the Belgian government in exile to control or direct the Comet Line.[14] British agent Donald Darling (\"Sunday\") gave her the code name of \"Postman.\"[16]\n\nThe arrest of Arnold Deppé in August 1941 introduced a note of caution into the Comet Line. Andrée de Jongh decided that Belgium was unsafe and thereafter worked and lived in Paris and Valenciennes, a French city on the border with Belgium. Her father Frederic took over some of her leadership duties in Belgium. In France, de Jongh received airmen from Brussels, cared for them in safe houses, escorted them by railroad to Bayonne or nearby cities near the Spanish border, and trekked with them across the Pyrenees to Spain. She escorted one group of three airmen in October 1941, another group of three in November, and two groups totaling 11 men in December 1941. That level of activity continued in 1942.[17] Once she had successfully crossed the border, de Jongh turned her charges over to the British who would drive them to Gibraltar where they would be flown back to Great Britain. While the airmen proceeded onward, de Jongh met in San Sebastián with British diplomat Michael Creswell, (\"Monday\"), who gave her money for the Comet Line's expenses plus messages to take back to France. While returning to Paris she reinforced the system of safe houses and helpers along the route and paid necessary expenses, although most members of Comet Line never received any compensation for their expenses.[19]\n\nEstimates of the number of times that de Jongh successfully escorted downed airmen across the border into Spain in 1941 and 1942 vary from 16 to 24 round trips. The number of persons, mostly airmen, she escorted successfully is about 118.[21]\n\nComet Line members and their families took great risks. Working for escape lines became more dangerous after November 1942 when southern France was occupied by the Germans and the whole of France came under direct Nazi rule. During the war hundreds of workers for the Comet Line were arrested by the Geheime Feldpolizei of the Abwehr and many were executed or deported to German prisons and concentration camps.\n\nIn January 1943, de Jongh led three British airmen south by train from Paris to Saint-Jean-de-Luz. From the railway station they walked in rain for two hours to the village of Urrugne, in the French Basque Country – the last stop on the escape line before the walk over the Pyrenees. With the airmen and de Jongh was her favorite Basque guide Florentino Goikoetxea, a smuggler wanted by the police on both sides of the border. They arrived at the safe house belonging to Frantxia Usandizanga, a Basque woman, intending to continue to the border, 7 kilometres (4.3 miles) distant. However, the river Bidasoa on the border was in flood and it would be too dangerous to attempt to cross. Goikoetxea went to another house to spend the night and de Jongh and the three airmen spent the night at Usandizanga's house. The next morning, 15 January 1943, de Jongh, the three airmen, and Usandizanga were arrested in the house by ten German soldiers. They had been betrayed, probably by a farm worker named Donato whom de Jongh knew but did not trust.\n\nDe Jongh was sent first to Fresnes prison in Paris and eventually to Ravensbrück concentration camp and Mauthausen. She was interrogated 19 times by the Abwehr and twice by the Gestapo. Although she admitted being the leader of the Comet Line to protect her father who was under suspicion, the Germans did not believe that this slight, young woman was more than a minor helper in the Comet Line.[27] Their underestimation of de Jongh's importance in the Comet Line probably saved her from execution. Later, while she was a prisoner in Ravensbrück, the Gestapo realized who she was and searched for her, but she eluded them by hiding her identity.\n\nIn de Jongh's absence and under the leadership of Jean Greindl and Antoine d'Ursel, the Comet Line continued to function and helped more than 700 Allied soldiers reach safety during the war. Although de Jongh survived in the concentration camps, she became gravely ill and undernourished by the time she was released by the advancing Allies in April 1945. Many of her colleagues died in captivity. Her father, Frédéric de Jongh was arrested in Paris on 7 June 1943 and executed on 28 March 1944. The three airmen arrested with her survived the war in prisoner-of-war camps.[30] Usandizanga was beaten to death in Ravensbrück by a guard shortly before the camp's liberation in April 1945.[31] Goikoetxea continued to be the preferred Comet Line guide until wounded and captured by the Germans (but rescued by the de Greef family) shortly before France was liberated by the Allies in 1944.[32]\n\nAfter her concentration camp experiences, de Jongh resurfaced in summer 1945 in the middle of the night at Donald Darling's Paris Awards Office. She still wore the pink and white striped dress that was the camp uniform. She was thin and suffering from health problems that lasted for the rest of her life.\n\nPost-war, de Jongh finished her nursing studies and worked in leprosariums, first in the Belgian Congo, then in Cameroon, next in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. and finally in Senegal. While de Jongh was working in Ethiopia, her mother was on her deathbed in Belgium and, in a measure of respect to her, the Royal Air Force made an unscheduled stop in Addis Ababa to take her to Belgium and later returned her to Ethiopia.[34] In 1959, while working at a leper colony in Coquilhatville, she met English novelist Graham Greene. Greene recorded her candid account of her war experiences in his journal which was published in 1961. In In Search of a Character: Two African Journals, Greene wrote that he asked her why she had come to the Congo; she replied, \"Because from the age of fifteen I wanted to cure lepers. If I had delayed any longer it would have been too late.\"[35] In poor health she eventually returned to Belgium with her colleague, Thérèse de Wael.[36][37]\n\nFor her wartime efforts, she was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom with golden palms, the British George Medal on 13 February 1946,[38] and became a Chevalier of the French Légion d'honneur. She also became a Chevalier of the Order of Leopold, received the Belgian Croix de Guerre/Oorlogskruis with palm, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Belgian Army. In 1985, she was made a Countess in the Belgian nobility by King Baudouin.[39]\n\nThe Countess de Jongh died on 13 October 2007, aged 90, at the Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, Brussels.[40][41] Her funeral service was held at the La Cambre Abbey, Ixelles, Brussels, and she was interred in the crypt of her parents at the Schaerbeek Cemetery.\n• The Last Passage, Lurre Telleria et Enara Goikoetxea, Moztu filmak & Amo films, 2010\n• The Nightingale (2015) an historical fiction novel inspired by de Jongh's WW II experiences, written by Kristin Hannah. 42\n• The Postwoman (2018) an historical fiction novel based on the story of Andrée de Jongh's life, written by Michael Kenneth Smith.\n• Secret Army, a BBC television series is based on Comet Line operations in Belgium. 43\n• Airey Neave of MI9 was responsible for supporting the Comet Line.

It is usually manufactured as a powder from corn gluten meal. Zein is one of the best understood plant proteins.[1] Pure zein is clear, odorless, tasteless, hard, water-insoluble, and edible, and it has a variety of industrial and food uses.[2][3]\n\nHistorically, zein has been used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric,[4] buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \"Vicara\".[2][5] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.[6][7] It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability.[8]\n\nZein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \"confectioner's glaze\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products[9] or as \"vegetable protein.\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs.[citation needed]\n\nZein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.[10][11] With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.[12][13] Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications.[citation needed]\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.[14] They are also studying medical applications such as using the zein molecule to \"carry biocompounds to targeted sites in the human body\".[15] There are a number of potential food safety applications that may be possible for zein-based packaging according to several researchers. A military contractor is researching the use of zein to protect MRE food packages.[16] Other packaging/food safety applications that have been researched include frozen foods,[17] ready-to-eat chicken,[18] and cheese and liquid eggs.[19] Food researchers in Japan have noted the ability of the zein molecule to act as a water barrier.[20]\n\nWhile there are numerous existing and potential uses for zein, the main barrier to greater commercial success has been its historic high cost until recently. Zein pricing is now very competitive with food shellac. Zein may be extracted as a byproduct in the manufacturing process for ethanol[21] or in new off-shore manufacture.[citation needed]\n\nAlpha-prolamins are the major seed storage proteins of species of the grass tribe Andropogoneae. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication.[22] In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes;[23] twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.[24]ZO® Skin Health | Medical Skin Care: The season of gifting brings about so many questions of what to get for your loved ones.

Swinney has served as Leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) on two occasions, since 2024 and between 2000 and 2004. He has held various roles within the Scottish Cabinet from 2007 to 2023 under First Ministers Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. Swinney was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for North Tayside from 1999 to 2011 and, following boundary changes, has been MSP for Perthshire North since 2011. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Tayside North from 1997 to 2001.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh, Swinney graduated with a MA in politics at the University of Edinburgh. He joined the SNP at a young age, and quickly rose to prominence by serving as the National Secretary from 1986 to 1992 and as Deputy Leader from 1998 to 2000. He served in the House of Commons as MP for Tayside North from 1997 to 2001. He was elected to the inaugural Scottish Parliament at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election. After Salmond resigned the party leadership in 2000, Swinney was elected at the 2000 leadership election. He became Leader of the Opposition in the Scottish Parliament. The SNP lost one MP at the 2001 general election and eight MSPs at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, despite the Officegate scandal unseating the previous Scottish Labour first minister, Henry McLeish. However, the only parties to gain seats in that election were the Scottish Greens and the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) which, like the SNP, support independence. After an unsuccessful challenge to his leadership in 2003, and the party's unfavourable results at the 2004 European Parliament election, Swinney resigned. Salmond returned to the role at the subsequent 2004 leadership election.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Swinney was a backbencher. At the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP won the highest number of seats, and Salmond was subsequently appointed first minister. Swinney served under Salmond as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth from 2007 to 2014. After Sturgeon succeeded Salmond, she appointed Swinney as Deputy First Minister in 2014. He also served as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Constitution and Economy, until that role was divided into two posts in the second Sturgeon government as a result of the expansion of the Scottish Parliament's financial powers; he was then appointed Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills in 2016, and then as Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery in 2021. On 25 May 2022, Swinney became the longest serving Deputy First Minister, surpassing the previous record which was held by Sturgeon. Swinney served as Acting Finance and Economy Secretary in addition to his position of Covid Recovery Secretary from July 2022 to March 2023. In March 2023, he announced his resignation from his senior positions in response to Sturgeon's resignation as first minister.\n\nSwinney spent the duration of Humza Yousaf's premiership on the backbenches and served as a member of the Scottish Parliament's Justice Committee. Following Yousaf's announcement of his resignation in April 2024, Swinney ran to succeed him at the 2024 SNP leadership election and was elected unopposed. His early premiership was marked by the loss of 39 seats at the 2024 general election, reducing the SNP to the second-largest party in Scotland and the fourth-largest party in the Westminster Parliament.\n\nJohn Ramsay Swinney was born on 13 April 1964[1] in the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, the son of Kenneth Swinney, a garage manager,[2] and Agnes Weir Swinney (née Hunter).[3] His uncle Tom Hunter was awarded the Victoria Cross whilst serving with the Royal Marines during the Second World War.[4] His maternal grandparents, Ramsey and Mary Hunter, were from England, having moved to Edinburgh in the 1920s.[5][6]\n\nSwinney was educated at Forrester High School, before attending the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with a Master of Arts Honours degree in politics in 1986.[7] He was a research officer for the Scottish Coal Project from 1987 to 1988, a senior management consultant with Development Options from 1988 to 1992, and a strategic planning principal with Scottish Amicable Life Assurance from 1992 to 1997.[8]\n\nSwinney joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1979 at the age of 15,[9] citing his anger at the way in which Scotland had been portrayed by television commentators at the Commonwealth Games.[10] He quickly became a prominent figure in the party's youth wing, the Young Scottish Nationalist, now known as the Young Scots for Independence (YSI).[11] He served as the SNP's Assistant National Secretary, before becoming the National Secretary in 1986, at the age of 22.[12]\n\nAt the 1997 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Tayside North constituency,[13] and in 1999 he was elected to represent the same area at the Scottish Parliament. He stood down as a Westminster MP at the 2001 general election in order to avoid splitting his time, in line with all of his colleagues who found themselves in a similar dual mandate position.\n\nIn 1999 Swinney was elected to the 1st Scottish Parliament, representing the North Tayside constituency.[14] In Salmond's opposition cabinet, he served as the Spokesman on Enterprise and Lifelong Learning. He also served on the Parliament's Finance Committee and was the Convener of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.[15]\n\nIn 2000 Alex Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP,[16][17] which triggered a leadership contest.[18][19] Swinney ran in the election against Alex Neil.[20][21] The leadership contest was dominated by internal fights in the party between Gradualists, who advocated Scottish devolution as step towards independence, and Fundamentalists, who were suspicious of devolution and supported a more radical approach.[22][23] Swinney represented the gradualist wing and Neil represented the fundamentalists wing.[24][25] Whilst both candidates supported the position of the SNP on the centre-left, Neil was seen as the more left-wing of the two, and individuals associated with the Neil campaign argued that a Swinney leadership would drag the SNP to the right.[26][27][28]\n\nSwinney won an overwhelming majority of votes by party delegates, securing 67.1% of votes.[29] He was appointed leader at the party's conference on 16 September 2000. Roseanna Cunningham, who endorsed Swinney in the leadership race, was elected Depute Leader.[30][31][32]\n\nSwinney's leadership quickly came under challenge. His subdued style of debating technique was often contrasted with that of his more charismatic predecessor.[33] In 2002 Dorothy-Grace Elder, the SNP MSP for the Glasgow region, resigned her party membership after coming dissatisfied with the leadership of the SNP. She sat as an independent MSP, but Swinney called for her resignation, describing her actions as a \"flout [of] the democratic will of the people of Glasgow\".[34] Margo MacDonald, a fundamentalist within the SNP, voiced her lack of confidence in Swinney's leadership. MacDonald was placed fifth in the Lothians region for the 2003 Parliament election in the SNP's candidate selection, effectively ending her chances of being re-elected as an SNP MSP.[35] In protest, she ran instead as an independent candidate and was later expelled from the party.[36]\n\nIn 2003 a former parliamentary candidate and a party activist in the Shetland Islands Brian Nugent announced that he was forming his own pro-independence party, the Scottish Party, which eventually relaunched itself as the Free Scotland Party, in response to what he perceived to be an overly pro-EU stance by the SNP.[37][38]\n\nSwinney led the SNP through a poor election result at the 2001 UK General election.[39] The party failed to take any of their target seats and saw the loss of one of their MPs, reducing their representation at Westminster from six to five. In the Perth constituency, the Scottish Conservatives were 50 votes behind the SNP.[40][41] Although the SNP's vote share remained the second-largest party, behind Labour, their vote share fell by 2%.[42] Swinney's predecessor, Salmond, stated \"consolidating as the second party in Scotland is no mean achievement\" and highlighted it put the SNP in a good position for the upcoming Scottish Parliament election in 2003.[43] Following the results of the election, Swinney admitted there were \"lessons to learn\" and ensured the SNP would be the \"principal opposition party in Scottish politics\".[44]\n\nIn the 2003 election, the SNP performed poorly in yet another election, with the party's vote share dropping by 4.9%.[45] They lost eight of their seats they had gained in the previous election under the leadership of Salmond. Despite a poor result, this was also mirrored by the Scottish Labour Party, who lost six MSPs and their vote share dropped by 4.2%.[46] The SNP remained the second-largest party at Holyrood. The decline in support for the SNP was viewed by some as a rejection of the case for Scottish independence, however, the only parties which increased their representation in that election were the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Scottish Green Party, both of which also support independence.[47][48]\n\nFollowing the results of the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, Bill Wilson, a party activist, became convinced that a change of direction was needed by the SNP leadership.[49] After discussing this with various SNP members, he was persuaded to contest the leadership himself and launched a challenge against Swinney.[50] Wilson ran a campaign attacking Swinney's proposals for party reform, which he claimed would centralise power and impoverish local branches. Wilson also challenged Swinney to a series of debates, although Swinney refused to take part.[51][52]\n\nThe election was yet another fight between the party's fundamentalists and gradualists, with Wilson attacking Swinney's proposal for a referendum on independence before pursuing negotiations with the British government. Wilson argued that as soon as the SNP can form a government it should pursue negotiations to end the union.[53]\n\nThe election was held at the party's 69th annual conference, and saw Swinney winning a massive victory over Wilson.[54] Moves in support of Wilson's proposition of pursuing independence negotiations without a referendum were thrown out at the party conference, and Swinney won significant policy battles over imposing a monthly levy on party MPs, MSPs, and MEPs. In a surprise result, the new central membership system was also approved.[55] The membership changes had been a key issue of attack from Wilson.[53] Soon afterwards, the party's National Executive Committee decided to suspend and then expel Campbell Martin. He had backed Wilson's leadership challenge and had continued to be overtly critical of Swinney's leadership, resulting in disciplinary action.[56] This was the last SNP election to use the delegate voting method. Future elections would be based on a one-person-one-vote postal vote system.[57]\n\nIn September 2003 he urged SNP activists to ask the public, \"Do you want independence, yes or no? And then tell the Brits to get off.\" A spokesman for Scottish Labour condemned the Swinney's use of language and said, \"There is no place in Scotland for his brand of extreme nationalism.\"[58]\n\nThough retaining its two seats at the 2004 European elections, in a smaller field of 7 (Scotland up until then had 8 MEPs) the Scottish press and certain elements within the fundamentalist wing of the Party depicted the result as a disaster for the SNP putting further pressure on Swinney to resign.[59][60]\n\nAfter the results of the 2004 European Parliament election, senior figures within the SNP began privately briefing against Swinney. Gil Paterson, a former MSP for Central Scotland, was the first to call for Swinney's departure, with Michael Russell, a former potential campaign manager for Swinney calling for a change in approach from the SNP.[61] Members of the SNP shadow cabinet began privately discussing removing Swinney from the leadership, and Alex Salmond advised Swinney to resign in exchange for senior party figures not calling openly for his resignation.[62] On 22 June 2004, Swinney resigned as leader of the Scottish National Party, triggering a leadership contest.[63][64][65] He was succeeded by Alex Salmond after winning more than 75% of votes against Roseanna Cunningham and Michael Russell on a joint leadership ticket with Nicola Sturgeon.[66][67][68]\n\nFrom 2004 until the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Swinney sat on the SNP's opposition backbenches. He served as a convener on the Parliament's European and External Relations Committee from 2004 to 2005 and deputy convener on the Finance Committee from 2005 to 2007. Swinney was a substitute member of the Audit Committee from 2004 to 2007.[69] In September 2005, Swinney was made Shadow Minister for Finance.[70][71]\n\nIn the 2007 election to the 3rd Scottish Parliament, the SNP emerged as the largest party, with one seat more than the governing Scottish Labour.[72][73] Initially the SNP proposed coalition talks with the Scottish Liberal Democrats, however, they declined and instead Swinney led coalition talks with the Scottish Greens.[74] After an agreement, Salmond was appointed first minister of Scotland and he appointed Swinney as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth in his first minority government.[75]\n\nAs response to Swinney not notifying the Scottish Parliament that he had let the Scottish Variable Rate lapse due to not funding this tax mechanism, the Scottish Parliament voted to censure him and called his actions \"an abuse of power\".[76] Subsequently, a freedom of information request showed that even if Swinney had funded the mechanism, problems and delays in the HM Revenue & Customs computer system made any collection of the tax impossible. The Scottish Government added, \"The power has not lapsed, the HMRC simply does not have an IT system capable of delivering a ten-month state of readiness.\"[77][78]\n\nAs Finance Secretary, Swinney was faced with the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which resulted in the Scottish economy entering recession.[79] The Scottish economy began to gradually slow in 2007 as a result of stock market concerns regarding the U.S. housing market. Scottish economic output fell for four consecutive quarters before a slight recovery in Q3 in 2009, before falling again by the end of 2009.[80] Swinney advocated that at the start of the 2008 financial crisis, the Scottish Government and Swinney as finance secretary \"acted swiftly to provide an immediate capital stimulus to Scotland's economy at the start of the 2008 financial crisis. As a consequence, Scotland's experience of recession has been shorter and shallower than the rest of the UK\".[81]\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Yes Scotland campaign in the 2014 referendum, Salmond resigned as leader of the SNP and Swinney was seen as a likely candidate in the leadership race, however, he \"unreservedly\" ruled himself out for a second bid as leader and endorsed Nicola Sturgeon.[82][83][84] Sturgeon was elected unopposed as leader and was subsequently appointed First Minister of Scotland.[85][86] On 21 November 2014, Sturgeon appointed Swinney as Deputy First Minister.[87] He remained as Finance Secretary in Sturgeon's new cabinet.[88][89]\n\nIn the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, the SNP lost its overall majority, but remained the largest party with Sturgeon securing a second term as first minister.[90][91] She reappointed Swinney as deputy first minister, and for the first time in nine years, he was reshuffled from his roles as Finance Secretary to Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills.[92][93]\n\nAfter the 2017 General Election saw the SNP lose 21 seats, pollster Professor John Curtice told the BBC that the party's record on education had likely dented its popularity: \"The SNP may want to reflect that their domestic record, not least on schools, is beginning to undermine their support among those who on the constitutional question are still willing to support the Nationalist position.\"[94]\n\nIn March 2020, after the results of Scottish students dropped in maths and science in the international PISA rankings for education, Swinney admitted, \"There is progress to be made in maths and science.\"[95] Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith said: \"These two areas are so critical to the success of much of Scotland's modern economy. We should be doing so much better.\"[96]\n\nIn August 2020, Swinney was subject to a vote of no confidence in Parliament, with the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all accusing Swinney of creating an exam results system which \"unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed so well\".[97] During the No Confidence debate, Nicola Sturgeon described him as \"one of the most decent and dedicated people in Scottish politics\", while The Herald newspaper reported that: \"Mr Swinney endured a deeply uncomfortable hour in the Holyrood chamber, as opposition MSPs said he had been a serial failure at the education portfolio, and he knew it.\"[98] The motion was defeated by 67 votes to 58 resulting in Swinney surviving the vote and remaining as Scottish Education Secretary.[99][100]\n\nIn March 2021 Swinney was the subject of a second motion of no confidence.[101] As the minister in charge of liaising with the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints, Swinney twice refused to publish legal advice requested by the committee.[102][better source needed] After two votes in Parliament failed to persuade him to publish the advice, opposition parties announced a motion of no confidence in him.[102] Swinney u-turned and published the advice; the Scottish Greens declared they would not support the motion of no confidence and it was defeated by 65 votes to 57.[102]\n\nA report by Audit Scotland in March 2021 concluded that the results of Swinney's efforts to reduce the poverty related attainment gap in Scottish education were \"limited and [fell] short of the Scottish Government’s aims. Improvement needs to happen more quickly and there needs to be greater consistency across the country.\" In 10 Scottish council areas the attainment gap between the richest and the poorest children increased.[103]\n\nFollowing the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Scottish Labour urged Sturgeon to replace Swinney as Cabinet Secretary for Education, citing what it called \"a litany of failures\", in the \"hope a new minister can stop the rot.\"[104] On 18 May, Sturgeon announced Swinney would continue as Deputy First Minister but would be reshuffled to the new cabinet role as Cabinet Secretary for Covid Recovery.[105] Swinney also served as Acting Cabinet Secretary for Finance and the Economy from July 2022, whilst Kate Forbes was on maternity leave.\n\nFollowing Sturgeon's resignation in February 2023, Swinney announced on 2 March 2023 that he was standing down from his position as Deputy First Minister. He stated that it had been an \"honour to serve Scotland\".[106] In March 2023, Swinney moved to the SNP's backbenches and served as a member of the Scottish Parliament's Justice Committee.[107][108] He spent the duration of Humza Yousaf's premiership on the backbenches.\n\nFollowing Yousaf's resignation in April 2024 amid a government crisis, Swinney launched his leadership bid on 2 May, after Kate Forbes, who was a serious contender to become leader, dropped out and endorsed him.[109]\n\nGraeme McCormick announced he would challenge Swinney for the leadership, saying he had the 100 nominations on 5 May.[110] Just hours later, he withdrew and endorsed Swinney, who became the presumptive nominee.[111]\n\nOn 6 May, with no other candidates put forward, Swinney was elected as party leader unopposed.[112] He said that he would work with Scottish unionists as leader.[113]\n\nSwinney was officially sworn into office as first minister of Scotland on 8 May 2024 at the Court of Session in Edinburgh after receiving the Royal Warrant of Appointment by King Charles III.[114][115]\n\nSwinney's early premiership was marked by the resolution of the Michael Matheson iPad scandal: the SNP MSP Michael Matheson had incurred a £11,000 bill after taking a Parliamentary iPad while on a family holiday, and had attempted to claim the bill back on expenses before admitting that the iPad had not been used for work purposes. Swinney refused to support the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee's proposed sanction on Matheson, describing Matheson as a \"friend and colleague\" who had \"made mistakes\", and casting doubt on the integrity of the committee's process: describing the process as \"prejudiced\", Swinney claimed that Conservative MSP Annie Wells should have removed herself from the committee due to previous comments about Matheson's conduct. Swinney's support for Matheson was described as \"incredible and indefensible\" by the Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, and \"unbelievable and embarrassing\" by the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Swinney directed the SNP to abstain on the parliamentary vote on the committee's recommendations, after introducing an amendment re-iterating Swinney's complaints about the investigation into Matheson. The Scottish Parliament subsequently voted in support of the committee's proposed sanction, banning Matheson from the Scottish Parliament for 27 days and withholding his salary 54 days, the heaviest sanction ever awarded to an MSP.[116][117]\n\nThe majority of Swinney's cabinet were previously part of Yousaf's previous governments. The only addition to the cabinet was Kate Forbes replacing Shona Robison as Deputy First Minister of Scotland, and taking part of Màiri McAllan's responsibility for economy into her portfolio as Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic.[118] Robison was, however, re-appointed by Swinney as Finance Secretary with additional responsibility for local government, with McAllan appointed as the reduced portfolio of Cabinet Secretary for Net Zero and Energy.[119]\n\nSwinney claimed that he believed that Scottish independence could \"be achieved in the next five years\" as a result of Brexit consequences on Scotland and the Scottish economy, as well as the cost of living crisis. In an interview with Sky News, Swinney said \"if we look at two of the biggest issues we face as a country in Scotland; the effect of the cost of living and the implications of Brexit. Both of those are major strategic factors that are doing severe economic and social damage to Scotland because of bad decisions taken in Westminster. And independence is the answer to that\".[120]\n\nEarly into his premiership, Swinney faced questions from opposition parties regarding the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill which had been introduced by Shona Robison and was blocked by the UK Government using a Section 35 order under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998. Swinney claimed that \"the Supreme Court has said that we can't legislate in that area and we can't take forward that legislation\".[121]\n\nIn July 2024, Swinney and his party contested all 57 Scottish seats for the 2024 United Kingdom general election. The SNP went into the election as the largest party at Westminster from Scotland, having won 48 out of 59 seats at the 2019 United Kingdom general election.[122] Following the results of the 2024 United Kingdom general election in Scotland, the SNP became the second largest party in the UK Parliament representing Scottish seats, having won 9 seats, losing a total of 39 seats across Scotland.[123] Across the United Kingdom, the results saw a Labour Party landslide victory, and similarly in Scotland, Scottish Labour became the largest party representing Scottish constituencies at Westminster.[124]\n\nFollowing the results, Swinney said that the outcome of the election in Scotland was \"very, very difficult and damaging\". High profile SNP MPs lost their seats in the election, including Kirsten Oswald, Tommy Sheppard, Alison Thewliss and Joanna Cherry.[125] On 7 July 2024, newly elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Keir Starmer travelled to Edinburgh on the first stop of his tour of the four countries of the United Kingdom and met with Swinney at the official residence of the First Minister, Bute House. During the meeting, both Swinney and Starmer agreed to \"work together\" and to \"reset the relationship between their two governments\".[126]\n\nIn September 2022, amid the death and state funeral of Elizabeth II, Swinney stated that the monarch should remain head of state of an independent Scotland.[127] In May 2024, during an interview with Sky News, Swinney claimed that he believed that Scotland could become independent \"in the next five years\" as a consequence of Brexit and the cost of living crisis.[128] In May 2024, Swinney described himself as following a \"moderate centre-left agenda\".[129]\n\nSwinney was married to Lorna King from 1991 to 1998. They had two children: Judith and Stuart. The couple divorced in 1998 after the Daily Record revealed King had an affair with a married nursery teacher.[130] The marriage was subsequently annulled by the Roman Rota in order that Swinney be allowed to marry in the Catholic Church, to which his second wife belongs.[131]\n\nIn 2003, Swinney married Elizabeth Quigley, a BBC Scotland News reporter.[132] Quigley was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2000.[133] In 2010, she gave birth to Swinney's third child, Matthew.[134][135] They live near Blairgowrie in Perth and Kinross.[136]\n\nSwinney is a member of the Church of Scotland and has described himself as \"a man of deep Christian faith\".[137] However, he has clashed with his party colleague Kate Forbes due to her religious views (Forbes is a member of the Free Church of Scotland, a smaller and more conservative religious group).[138]\n\nSwinney was appointed to the Privy Council on 10 July 2024, entitling him to be styled \"The Right Honourable\" for life.[139]John Swinney: On Friday 26 May 2017 I attended the \"Remarks by the Honourable Barack H Obama\" event as a guest of West Coast Capital (a Private Equity Firm). The cost of hospitality for the evening was £500, which was met by West Coast Capital.\n\nOn 16 November 2024 I and my family attended a show at Pitlochry Festival Theatre.

The fencing coach at Osung High School had already noticed him in middle school and persuaded him to switch sports.[3] He majored in physical education at Dong-Eui University, then one of the few universities which had a fencing team.[4]\n\nGu was already selected for the youth national teams as a high school student and participated in the 2006 Cadet (Under 17) World Championships. He won individual gold at the Junior (Under 20) World Championships and Junior Asian Championships in 2008.[5][6]\n\nGu was first selected for the senior national team in 2010.[6] He made headlines that year by winning two silver medals in the Grand Prix circuit and individual gold medals at both the Asian Games and Asian Championships. The media dubbed him the \"scary rookie\" after he narrowly defeated compatriot Oh Eun-seok, then world number 2, in the semi-finals of the Asian Games.[7][6] His gold medal at the Asian Games meant that he was exempted from mandatory military service.[8]\n\nGu won two individual gold medals at the 2010–11 Fencing World Cup and ended the competition ranked number 3 overall. He was selected to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics along with Oh, Kim Jung-hwan and Won Woo-young. The Olympics began on a sour note as he, Kim and Won did not make it past the semi-final stage of the individual event.[9] They managed to win a historic gold in the team event, South Korea's first ever Olympic gold medal in the men's team sabre category.[10][11] The quartet continued to dominate in the team events, sweeping gold at both the Asian Championships and Asian Games hosted at home and winning silver at the World Championships. They also successfully defended their team gold medal at the 2015 Asian Fencing Championships.\n\nOh Eun-seok and Won Woo-young both retired and were replaced by youngsters Oh Sang-uk and Kim Jun-ho. There was no men's team sabre event at 2016 Summer Olympics due to the now-abolished rotation policy. Gu and Kim Jung-hwan both qualified for the individual event. However, he was narrowly defeated by Mojtaba Abedini, whom Kim went on to defeat in the bronze medal bout.[12] The following year, the team won gold in the men's team sabre event at the 2017 World Fencing Championships, the country's first team gold at the worlds since 2005, and swept team gold at the 2018 World Championships and Asian Games.[13] Gu himself won individual silver in the 2017 worlds and successfully defended his Asian Games gold the following year.[14][8]\n\nKim Jung-hwan announced his retirement after the 2018 Asian Games and was replaced by Ha Han-sol. The team won gold at the 2019 World Fencing Championships, Gu's third consecutive team gold at the worlds.[15] Kim came back out of retirement and reunited with the same team from the 2018 Asian Games and Asian Championships. They qualified for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which had been postponed for a year. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to coaching staff, they won team gold, making Gu and Kim the first South Korean fencers (among all fencing disciplines, male or female) to win back-to-back team gold medals at the Olympics.[a][16][17]\n\nThe 2021–22 World Cup season began uneventfully for Gu as he was not able to participate in the Orléans Grand Prix held in October, having tested positive for COVID-19 the day before the competition.[18][19] He returned to the team which won gold at both the Men's Team World Cup in January and the World Championships to retain their #1 ranking in the team category. Gu himself finished that season on a high by winning gold at the Asian Championships and medalling for the first time at a Grand Prix event since 2018, only losing to Áron Szilágyi in the Padua Grand Prix final by a single point.[20][21]\n\nHe married flight attendant Park Eun-ju in 2019.[86] In November 2022, Gu announced his wife's pregnancy through a television program.[87] His wife gave birth to a son on 6 March 2023.[88]\n\nDespite sharing the same family name and bon-gwan (Gu clan of Neungseong), Gu is not an immediate relative of singer and actor Gu Bon-seung or the Koo chaebol family associated with LG Corporation. He and Gu Bon-seung indicated through comments left on one another's official Instagram accounts that they were well aware of the rumors, quipping that it was \"an honor\" to be mistaken as relatives.[89][90]INTERNATIONAL FENCING FEDERATION - The International Fencing Federation official website: Why this sport?

It was a Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement and a major market town from those times through Norman and medieval times to the present day. It is the seat of the Church of England Diocese of Chichester and is home to a 12th-century cathedral.\n\nThe city has two main watercourses: the Chichester Canal and the River Lavant. The Lavant, a winterbourne, runs to the south of the city walls; it is hidden mostly in culverts when close to the city centre.\n\nThere is no recorded evidence that Chichester was a settlement of any size before the coming of the Romans.[6] The area around Chichester is believed to have played a significant part during the Roman invasion of AD 43, as confirmed by evidence of military storage structures in the area of the nearby Fishbourne Roman Palace.[7] The city centre stands on the foundations of the Romano-British city of Noviomagus Reginorum, capital of the Civitas Reginorum.[8][9]\n\nThe Roman road of Stane Street, connecting the city with London, started at the east gate, while the Chichester to Silchester road started from the north gate. The plan of the city is inherited from the Romans: the North, South, East and West shopping streets radiate from the central market cross dating from medieval times.\n\nThe original Roman city wall was over 6+1⁄2 feet (2.0 m) thick with a steep ditch (which was later used to divert the River Lavant). The lower parts of the existing city walls are Roman, but most of the above-ground work is later.\n\nThe city was also home to some Roman baths, found down Tower Street when preparation for a new car park was underway. A museum, The Novium, preserving the baths was opened on 8 July 2012.\n\nAn amphitheatre was built outside the city walls, close to the East Gate, in around 80 AD. The area is now a park, but the site of the amphitheatre is discernible as a gentle bank approximately oval in shape; a notice board in the park gives more information.\n\nIn January 2017, archaeologists using underground radar reported the discovery of the relatively untouched ground floor of a Roman townhouse and outbuilding. The exceptional preservation is due to the fact the site, Priory Park, belonged to a monastery and has never been built upon since Roman times.[10]\n\nThe legendary foundation of Anglo-Saxon Chichester is described by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that says that the area was annexed towards the close of the fifth century, by Ælle and his three sons. The city was supposedly renamed after his son, Cissa. It also says that it was the principal city of the Kingdom of Sussex. However, the foundation story is regarded as a myth by historians as there is no archaeological evidence that Chichester was reoccupied after the Romans left until the 9th century.[11][12]\n\nIn the 9th century Alfred the Great set about building a system of fortified towns or forts, known as burhs, in response to the Viking threat. This included old Roman settlements where the walls could be rebuilt and strengthened. Chichester was one of these and was rebuilt probably between 878 and 879. The Burghal Hidage is an Anglo-Saxon document that provides a list of over thirty burhs, mainly in the ancient Kingdom of Wessex, and the taxes (recorded as numbers of hides) assigned for their maintenance. For each five hides the town was expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep. Chichester was one of the larger burhs and was rated at 1500 hides.[13][14]\n\nThe system was supported by a communication network based on hilltop beacons to provide early warning. It has been suggested that one such link ran from Chichester to London.[15][16]\n\nFollowing the Norman Conquest in 1066, the cathedral that had been founded in 681 at Selsey was moved to Chichester after the Council of London of 1075 decreed that Sees should be centred in cities.[17]\n\nWhen the Domesday Book of 1086 was compiled, Cicestre[18] in the Hundred of Stockbridge (comprising 102 households across the five areas outside the city)[19] comprised 300 dwellings which held a population of 1,500 people, and had an annual value of 25 pounds. There was a mill named Kings Mill that would have been rented to local slaves and villeins. After the Battle of Hastings the township of Chichester was handed to Roger de Mongomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, for courageous efforts in the battle, but it was forfeited in 1104 by the 3rd Earl. Shortly after 1066 Chichester Castle was built by Roger de Mongomerie to consolidate Norman power.[20] In around 1143 the title Earl of Arundel (also known as the Earl of Sussex until that title fell out of use) was created and became the dominant local landowner. In 1216, Chichester Castle, along with Reigate Castle, was captured by the French, but regained the following year, when the castle was ordered to be destroyed by the king.[21] Between 1250 and 1262, the Rape of Chichester was created from the western half of Arundel rape, with the castle as its administrative centre.[22]\n\nIn about 1400 Bishop Robert Reed erected a cross in the Market Place.[23]\n\nAt Christmas 1642 during the First English Civil War, the city was besieged and St Pancras church was destroyed by gunfire.[24]\n\nA military presence was established in the city in 1795 with the construction of a depot on land where the Hawkhurst Gang had been hanged. It was named the Roussillon Barracks in 1958.[25]\n\nThe military presence had mostly ceased by 2014 and the site was being developed for housing.[26] with the former Guardroom known as The Keep playing host to a detachment of the Army Cadet Force.[27]\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th-century, Chichester's livestock market was recorded as the second largest in the country.[28]\n\nChichester was bombed by the Luftwaffe during World War II, but fared relatively well compared to larger English cities.[29][30] On 11 May 1944, a United States Army Air Forces Consolidated B-24 Liberator crashed in the city, killing three, injuring 38, and damaging hundreds of local buildings.[31]\n\nA new West Sussex county library was built in Tower Street in 1967, designed by county architect FR Steele. This was listed at Grade II in 2015.[32]\n\nIn December 1993 and January 1994, Chichester was affected by the 1993–94 West Sussex floods.[33]\n\nOn 21 November 2017, the Chichester District Council adopted a 'Southern Gateway' plan to redevelop an area from the law courts to the canal basin, including the two railway level crossings.[34][35]\n\nHistorically, Chichester was a city and liberty,[6] thereby largely self-governing. Although it has retained its city status, in 1888 it became a municipal borough, transferring some powers to West Sussex administrative county. In 1974 the municipal borough became part of the much larger Chichester District. The City Council[36] was retained but it only has the powers of a parish council; control of services is largely in the hands of Chichester District Council and West Sussex County Council.\n\nThe City Council meets in the Council House on North Street, which dates from 1731.[37] Prior to this the City Council, and its predecessor the City Corporation, had met in Chichester Guildhall. In addition to its own council offices, those of the Chichester District and the West Sussex County Council are located in the city.\n\nThe City Council consists of eighteen elected members serving five wards of the city – North, South, East, West, and Central.[38] Elections to the City Council last took place on Thursday 5 May 2023.[39] The current makeup of the City Council is shown below - those marked * are also Chichester District Councillors.\n\nChichester is represented in the House of Commons by the Chichester constituency, held since the 2024 General Election by Jess Brown-Fuller.[40] From 1660 to 1868, Chichester returned two members of Parliament, this was reduced to one member by the Reform Act 1867. The Conservative Party is dominant, with the constituency returning a Conservative member at every election since 1868, with the exception of the Liberal Charles Rudkin in 1923. Between 1812 and 1894 the constituency was represented exclusively by members of the Lennox family.[41]\n\nThe following people and organisations have received the Freedom of the City of Chichester.\n\nThe City of Chichester is located on the River Lavant south of its gap through the South Downs. This winterbourne for part of its course now runs through the city in underground culverts.[51] The city's site made it an ideal place for settlement, with many ancient routeways converging here. The oldest section lies within the medieval walls of the city, which are built on Roman foundations.[52]\n\nThe Chichester conservation area, designated for its architectural and historic interest,[53] encompasses the whole of the Roman town, and includes many Grade I and II listed buildings. Further to the north lies the separate conservation area around the former Graylingwell Hospital, and to the south, the Chichester Conservation Area has been extended recently to include the newly restored canal basin and part of Chichester Canal itself. The Conservation Area has been split into eight 'character' areas, based on historic development, building type, uses and activities.\n\nChichester has a maritime climate. With its position in southern England, Chichester has mild winters and cool summers. West Sussex has high sunshine levels compared with other parts of the UK with around 1,900 hours annually.[54]\n\nThe 2011 census recorded a population of 26,795 for the city of Chichester, forming 12,316 households.[55] The 2021 census recorded an increase in population to 29,407, forming 13,263 households. There is a small imbalance in the sex ratio, with 15,701, female residents (53.3%) and 13,706 male residents (46.7%). 26,622 residents (91%) listed their ethnic group as white.[2]\n\nChichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.[56]\n\nThe city has a tourist industry.[57] Several marinas are situated in the area together with related industries. A recent government study suggested that the area has a lot of employment with the public sector (as well as within the tourism and leisure industries), with a growing number of self-employed people in the area.[58]\n\nThe city holds an annual four-week arts and music festival (\"Festival of Chichester\") held in June and July.[59]\n\nChichester Cathedral has a year-round programme of music, talks and other events, including free lunchtime concerts of classical music.\n\nChichester Festival Theatre, is one of the United Kingdom's flagship producing and touring theatres, whose annual summer season attracts actors, writers and directors from the West End theatre and the USA.[60]\n\nPallant House Gallery, winner of the 2007 gallery of the year Gulbenkian Prize, has a major collection of chiefly modern British art and in 2006 opened a new extension that houses the collection of Sir Colin St John Wilson. It has a changing programme of exhibitions.[61]\n\nChichester is home to the South Downs Planetarium & Science Centre, which opened in 2001 and features a program of public star shows in its 100-seat theatre.\n\nThe Sloe Fair, a funfair that dates back to the 12th Century, is held annually on 20 October in the city's Northgate car park.[62]\n\nChichester Cinema at New Park[63] is the city's first and only arthouse cinema. It shows a selection of mainstream, small-budget and older films 7 days a week. It hosts an annual 18-day International Film Festival in August/September. Vice-presidents are Maggie Smith and Kenneth Branagh. There is a larger, multiplex cinema located at Chichester Gate. Chichester's previous cinemas were the Olympia Electric on Northgate (1911–1922), the Plaza Cinema on South Street (1920–1960, the Odeon from 1945 and now Iceland supermarket), the Granada Exchange at the Corn Exchange (1922–1980) and the Gaumont on Eastgate Square (1937–1961, later the swimming baths).[64]\n\nThe Chichester Open Mic has supported regular programmes of readings by contemporary poets in the city since 2010. It also hosts a high-profile annual event under the banner Poetry and All That Jazz which included performances by Don Paterson in 2010, Sam Willetts in 2011, and David Harsent in 2012.[65]\n\nIn 2012 The Novium, Chichester's museum, was opened by author Kate Mosse.[66] Designed by the architect Keith Williams, is approximately 2.4 times the size of the previous museum in Little London. Key highlights are Roman Bath House, Jupiter Stone and Chilgrove Mosaic.\n\nIn May 2013 Chichester hosted the Chichester Street Art Festival week where international street artists created colourful murals around the city.[67]\n\nChichester is mentioned in a 1992 episode of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, the 2003 film Bright Young Things directed by Stephen Fry, the 2005 film Stoned about Brian Jones from the Rolling Stones, and also in the 2009 film Sherlock Holmes. The city is periodically referred to in Call the Midwife, as the seat of the Order of Saint Raymond Nonnatus, the mother house's exterior being depicted in episode 1.6.\n\nThe West Sussex Record Office is in Orchard Street and contains the county archives. On 21 April 2017 it was announced that a second parchment manuscript copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, now termed The Sussex Declaration, had been discovered in the archives.[68][69]\n\nChichester has one of the highest rates of empty homes in England, with 1 in every 17 houses vacant. In October 2020, 3,444 houses were vacant, of which 3,302 were second homes.[56]\n\nFounded in 1881, the Chichester Symphony Orchestra has both amateur and professional players. Three concerts are given each year with the summer concert being part of the Chichester Festivities while the autumn concert is included in the Chichester Cathedral Lunchtime Series.[70] The Chichester Singers, under musical director Jonathan Willcocks, perform classical and contemporary works in concert.[71][72]\n\nThe Chichester RAJF (From \"Real Ale and Jazz Festival\"), was a four-day festival of music and real ale held each July in tents beside the 13th century Guildhall in Priory Park.[73] Founded in 1980 by members of Chichester Hockey Club as a fund-raising event, the festival's early years focused on traditional jazz and featured performers such as Kenny Ball, Humphrey Lyttelton and Kenny Baker. In the 1990s blues and R&B were introduced and acts including Status Quo, Blondie, Boney M, Howard Jones, Go West, The Pretenders and Simple Minds played the festival up until its final staging, in 2011.[citation needed]\n\nThe City of Chichester has been twinned with Chartres, France, since February 1959 and Ravenna, Italy, since December 1996[74][75] and Speyer, Germany, since 2023.[76] Friendship links have also been established with Marktredwitz in Germany, Kursk in Russia and Valletta in Malta.[75]\n\nLocal news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter.[77]\n\nChichester's local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.8 FM, Heart South on 96.7 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex on 96.6 FM and community based radio stations V2 Radio which broadcast online and Chichester Hospital Radio that broadcast on 1431 AM from the St Richard's Hospital in the town.[78][79]\n\nThe city is served by the weekly newspaper Chichester Observer.[80]\n\nChichester Cross, which is a type of buttercross familiar in old market towns, was built in 1501 as a covered marketplace,[81] and stands at the intersection of the four main roads in the centre of the city.\n\nChichester Cathedral, formally known as the Cathedral Church of the Holy Trinity, is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Chichester. It is a Grade I listed building from 1075.\n\nThe Butter Market in North Street was designed by John Nash, and was opened in 1808 as a food and produce market.[82]\n\nThe Corn Exchange on East Street was built in 1833, one of the first in the country.[83] From the 1880s it was used for drama and entertainment and became a cinema from the 1910s.[84] An attempt to convert it to a bingo hall was refused in 1977.[85] As it could not be converted to a multiplex it was closed on 9 August 1980.[85] It remained closed and unused for six years until the front was opened as a fast food restaurant and the rear converted for offices.[85][86] From 2005 the front has been used by a clothing retailer.[87]\n\nIn 1921, Sir William Robertson unveiled a war memorial in Eastgate Square for soldiers who died in World War I. The memorial was relocated to Litten Gardens in 1940. The city council subsequently added the names of soldiers who died in World War II.[88]\n\nChichester railway station, on the West Coastway line, has regular services to Brighton, London Victoria via Gatwick Airport, Portsmouth and Southampton.\n\nIn the past, there was a branch line to Midhurst in the north and a light railway, built by Colonel H. F. Stephens; it was known as the West Sussex Railway, which ran south to Selsey, and closed in 1935.\n\nChichester is the hub of several main roads. The most important of these is the A27 coastal trunk road, which connects Eastbourne with Southampton; it passes to the south of the city. The A27 connects Chichester to the M3, M27 and M275 motorways. The secondary coastal road, the A259, which begins its journey at Folkestone in Kent, joins the A27 here and ends in Havant to the west. Both of those roads make east–west connections.\n\nThree roads give Chichester access to the north: the A29 to London joins the A27 several miles to the east of the city; the A285 runs north-east to Petworth and beyond; and the A286 runs northwards towards Haslemere, Surrey.[89]\n\nChichester bus station, which is adjacent to the railway station, is the local hub for bus services. Operators include Stagecoach in the South Downs and Compass Travel.[90][91]\n\nChichester/Goodwood Airport is situated north of the city.[89]\n\nThere are several long-distance routes for walkers, cyclists and riders in the area; some of these routes, like the Centurion Way to West Dean, start here. Centurion Way was opened in the mid-1990s and runs along the former railway line. The name was chosen by Ben Adams, a local schoolboy who won a competition to name the path.[citation needed]\n\nIn summer 2020, COVID-19 temporary pop-up segregated cycle lanes were implemented predominately around parts of the city inner ring road and associated routes.[92]\n\nThere are three secondary schools in Chichester: Chichester Free School (which also has a primary sector in Bognor Regis), Bishop Luffa School and Chichester High School formed after the Chichester High School for Boys and Chichester High School for Girls merged in 2016.[93] In the primary sector there are two infant-only schools: Lancastrian and Rumboldswyke; the Central C of E Junior School; six all-level schools;[94] and two special-needs schools at Fordwater and St Anthony's.[citation needed]\n\nIn the independent sector there are three-day preparatory schools (Oakwood Preparatory School, The Prebendal School and Westbourne House School).\n\nThe higher and further educational institutions include the Chichester High School Sixth Form. It offers a range of A-Level and vocational courses. Bishop Luffa School sixth form also offers a range of A-Level courses and Chichester College, formerly Chichester College of Arts, Science and Technology; offers both foundation-level and degree-equivalent courses, mainly focused towards vocational qualifications for industry.[citation needed]\n\nThe University of Chichester[95] was granted degree-awarding body status by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority in October 2005.[96]\n\nChichester Cathedral, founded in the 11th century, is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, and contains a shrine to Saint Richard of Chichester. Its spire, built of the weak local stone, collapsed and was rebuilt during the 19th century. In the south aisle of the cathedral a glass panel in the floor enables a view of the remains of a Roman mosaic pavement. The cathedral is unusual in Britain in having a separate bell tower a few metres away from the main building, rather than integrated into it. Within the cathedral there is a medieval tomb of a knight and his wife, the inspiration of the poem \"An Arundel Tomb\", by Philip Larkin. A memorial statue exists of William Huskisson, once member of parliament for the city, but best remembered as the first man to be run over by a railway engine.[97] Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms were commissioned for the cathedral.\n\nIn addition to the cathedral there are five Church of England churches, St Richard's Roman Catholic church and nine religious buildings of other denominations.[98] Redundant churches include the Grade I-listed St John the Evangelist's Church, an octagonal white-brick proprietary chapel with an impressive three-decker pulpit.[99][100]\n\nSt Mary's Hospital Almshouses are a 13th-century religious foundation located at St Martin's Square, providing housing and care for elderly people from the Chichester diocese.[101]\n\nChichester City F.C. is the main football club and is based at Oaklands Park. They play in the Isthmian League South East Division.[102] The rugby club, Chichester R.F.C., is also based at Oaklands Park.[103]\n\nChichester is also host to a Detachment of the Army Cadet Force who meet several times a week at the detachment located within the former Roussilon Barracks.[108][109]\n\nThe city is home to the Chichester Sharks Flag American Football Club who are members of the BAFA National League.[110]\n\nChichester Runners and A.C. is a club with runners and athletes of all ages. Other sports include cycling.[111]\n\nWilliam Juxon, born 1582, attended The Prebendal School before studying at Oxford. He became chaplain to Charles I and was the last English cleric to hold both church and secular high office. He became Archbishop of Canterbury following the Restoration.[112] William Cawley, born 1602 in Chichester, was on the other side of the English Civil War. Also educated at Oxford University he became the Member of Parliament for Chichester in 1628 and for Midhurst in 1640. He was a regicide and served on the Council of State during the Commonwealth, being forced to flee to Switzerland after the Restoration.[113] A later MP for the town, William Huskisson was the first widely reported person to die in a railway accident, when he was run over by Stephenson's Rocket at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. In modern times middle-distance runner Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in 1969.[114]\n\nMilitary people have included Edric Gifford, 3rd Baron Gifford who won a Victoria Cross during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War. General Charles Harington Harington served in the Second Boer War and as a staff officer throughout World War I,[115] and military theorist Major General J. F. C. Fuller planned the first large scale tank assault at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917.[116]\n\nArtists who were born or lived most of their lives in Chichester include Richard Buckner, Heywood Hardy, James Hayllar, William Shayer and George Smith.[117][118] Author Kate Mosse (born 1961) studied at Chichester High School For Girls, living in Chichester until moving to Oxford to attend New College. She is author of the first main-stage new play by a woman at Chichester Festival Theatre, an adaptation of her novel The Taxidermist's Daughter, set in and around Chichester.[119]\n\nTim Peake, who became the first official British astronaut when he arrived on the International Space Station in December 2015, was born in Chichester in 1972. Peake attended the Chichester High School for Boys,[120][121] which now has a Sports and Conference centre named after him and opened by him.[citation needed]\n\nTom Odell, who was born in Chichester, is a singer and songwriter who gained success with his album, Wrong Crowd.[122]\n\nEdward Bradford Titchener, born in Chichester, created the school of thought in psychology that described the structure of the mind: structuralism.[123]\n\nTerritorial policing in Chichester is provided by Sussex Police, who have a station and a custody suite in Chichester on Kingsham Road.[124][125] The Police and Crime Commissioner is Katy Bourne.[126] Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, which has a station in Northgate.[127]\n\nSt Richard's Hospital, on Spitalfield Lane, is a medium-sized NHS hospital administered by the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust.[128] The South East Coast Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport to and from this facility. Nuffield Health operates a private hospital in the city.[129]\n\nChichester's distribution network operator for electricity is Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks, and for gas is SGN.[130] Portsmouth Water manages Chichester's drinking water, whilst Southern Water manages the city's wastewater.[131][132]\n• None Sharp, Thomas (1949).

WOW, what a wild ride it’s been!! But all worth it!! We celebrated our 2nd YEAR ANIVERSAY in APRIL 2024!! Crazy how time flies!!\n\nWhere our location has changed, our food and who we are has not. Barn Nork may have a new look from what some remember, but our goal is still the same; to cook food that makes you happy. What we do is basic; and honest. Our food is prepared with love, integrity and the highest quality ingredients we can possibly get our hands on. We care about you, and the food we feed you!!\n\nOur menu is ever changing however some dishes have become a mainstay for our regulars and local guests. We encourage people to explore our food and try new things, but at the same time, take comfort in dishes that give you joy.\n\nYou’ll see lots of the traditional Barn Nork usuals - Green Curry, Beef Massaman and of course Pad Thai, with features changing monthly. As we move forward, we’ll dig deeper into our roots to bring you more “street food”, a variety of “snacks/smaller plates” and eventually more noodle dishes!! We’re also working on baked goods and more flavours of ice-cream and sorbets!!\n\nOur Riverside location is quite small with just FOUR TABLES, as 75% of our restaurant is kitchen!! We have very limited sit-down-dining as we’re more of a “Thai market/industrial kitchen sorta place”, primarily serving take-out. Our little joint really “rocks” sometimes as we are blessed to be super busy, most of the time. We do our best to take as many orders as we can without jeopardizing the quality and care of our food. We’d rather is take a bit more time so it’s 100% delicious!!\n\nSummer months, allow us to have access to more outdoor space. You can order take-out, grab a drink and sit on the patio, or pull up a seat at our rail-side bar; plus, LOTS of green space in the park to through down a blanket and chill. AND DOGS? Dogs are always welcome!! Our love of dogs is equal, if not more than our love of food…..we’re not kidding!! Other than food, dogs are our life❤️\n\nThere are no “bells and whistles” at Barn Nork. We are casual, simple people and our food is a refection of what’s in our heart. There is no deliberate fusion-style adjustments or modern-day twists incorporated into how we cook, it’s just food from our perspective based what we love to eat and on what we grew up eating in Chang Mai. And it’s important to us you are full at the end of your meal!!\n\nEight-plus years ago when we started this adventure with fingers crossed, we never, EVER, EVER, imagined we could be so lucky to end up here!!??

She is known for her Genie Award–winning performance in Monsieur Lazhar (2011). She also played Liesel Meminger in the film adaptation of the best-selling novel The Book Thief (2013) and Caroline in The Kid Detective (2020). She stars as young Shauna in Showtime's series Yellowjackets (2021-present).\n\nMarie-Sophie Nélisse was born in Windsor, Ontario, on March 27, 2000. She is of French descent. Her mother, Pauline Belhumeur, left her job as a schoolteacher in 2013 to act as a talent manager for both Sophie and her younger sister Isabelle, who is also an actress.[4][5] Nélisse is fluent in both French and English. The family moved to Montreal when she was four.[6][7]\n\nShe spent her early years training in gymnastics, aiming for the 2016 Olympics, and signed to a talent agency to make money to pay for the training, but after getting the part in The Book Thief (and subsequent accolades) she shifted her focus to acting.[8][9] Additionally, Nélisse formed and still maintains a close friendship with her co-star from The Book Thief, Nico Liersch.\n\nBesides her Genie Award for Monsieur Lazhar, she won a Jutra Award for her performance and a Young Artist Award nomination as Best Leading Young Actress in an International Feature Film.[10] She held a recurring role the Québec sitcom Les Parents [fr] and she also starred in the title role of the 2015 film The Great Gilly Hopkins. In May 2016, Nélisse was present on the red carpet at Cannes Film Festival for the first time to present Canadian thriller movie Mean Dreams.[11][12][13]\n\nIn 2016, Nélisse was one of four actors selected by the Toronto International Film Festival, alongside Grace Glowicki, Jared Abrahamson, and Mylène Mackay for its \"Rising Stars\" programme, described as an \"intensive professional development programme [that] immerses participants in a series of public events and industry meetings during the Festival.\"[3][14] In June 2018, it was announced that she would be the face of Caroline Néron's Fall 2018 jewelry line.[15]\n\nAfter graduating high school in June 2017,[16] Nélisse confirmed she wouldn't be enrolling in post-secondary education for the time being due to commitments shooting Close in London and Morocco.[17] In a L'actualité series about \"Being 18 years old in 2018\", Nélisse spoke about entering adulthood in the era of the Weinstein effect, and deplored that when she announced she was looking for \"more mature roles\", she was quickly offered multiple roles where her characters would be raped and that scenarios she receives almost always include sexual elements.[18] One of these instances was when she turned down the sexually-charged lead role in Fugueuse, in which Ludivine Reding was eventually cast as Fanny, the titular teenage runaway who ends up a sex trafficking victim.[19]\n\nHer sister Isabelle Nélisse is also an actress, best known for her roles in Mama and HBO's film The Tale;[20] the sisters also acted together in Mirador [fr], Wait Till Helen Comes and Worst Case, We Get Married.The Book Thief - Wikipedia: The Book Thief is a historical fiction novel by the Australian author Markus Zusak, set in Nazi Germany during World War II. Published in 2005, The Book Thief became an international bestseller and was translated into 63 languages and sold 17 million copies. It was adapted into the 2013 feature film, The Book Thief.\n\nThe novel follows the adventures of a young girl, Liesel Meminger. Narrated by Death, the novel presents the lives and viewpoints of the many victims of the ongoing war. Themes throughout the story include death, literature, and love.[1]\n\nThe story begins in 1939 as Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old girl, travels with her younger brother, Werner, on a train to their new foster home in Molching. Their mother, a Communist, can no longer care for them due to the rising dangers of the Nazi regime. Tragically, Werner dies during the journey, and Liesel, devastated, steals a book, The Gravedigger’s Handbook, from the train station. This act of theft marks the beginning of her connection to words and storytelling.\n\nUpon arriving in Molching, Liesel is placed with her new foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann. Hans is kind-hearted and forms a bond with Liesel through shared moments, while Rosa is strict and harsh, often intimidating Liesel. Despite the difficulties in adjusting to her new life, Liesel finds comfort in her father’s warmth and their growing relationship.\n\nAs Liesel settles into her new home, she struggles with feelings of abandonment and guilt over her brother's death. Her friendship with the neighbor boy, Rudy Steiner, provides her with companionship and adventure. Rudy idolizes Jesse Owens, the African American athlete, and the two engage in mischievous activities, including stealing food and pranks.\n\nLiesel’s love for books deepens, leading her to steal more books to satiate her hunger for stories. She sneaks into the mayor’s mansion, where she discovers a library and develops a bond with the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann, who allows her access to the books.\n\nThe narrative takes a dramatic turn when the Hubermanns decide to hide a Jewish man named Max Vandenburg in their basement. Max has a connection to the Hubermann family, having known Hans from World War I. As Max becomes part of their household, he and Liesel form a close bond through their love of words and storytelling. Max shares his own experiences in a story titled The Standover Man, illustrating his struggles.\n\nAs the war escalates, Liesel’s world is increasingly affected by the brutality of the Nazi regime. The Hubermanns risk their lives to protect Max. Liesel’s perspective on the world shifts as she becomes aware of the persecution of Jews and the impact of war on her community.\n\nThe tension culminates during a bombing raid on Molching, resulting in tragic consequences. Liesel survives the attack, but the Hubermanns’ home is destroyed, and she loses her beloved foster parents, Hans and Rosa. Among the victims of the bombing is Rudy Steiner, Liesel’s best friend and confidant, whose death leaves her devastated. This profound loss leaves Liesel alone and grappling with overwhelming grief.\n\nAfter the bombing, Liesel is taken in by the mayor and his wife, where she begins to piece her life back together. In her new environment, she finds comfort in reading and writing, continuing to honor the memory of Hans, Rosa, and Rudy. The mayor's wife, Ilsa, recognizes Liesel's talent and passion for storytelling.\n\nAs the war comes to a close, Liesel’s experiences shape her understanding of the world. The final chapters reveal Liesel as an adult, reflecting on her life and the memories of those she lost during the war. She eventually emigrates to Australia, where she marries and raises a family, but her heart remains tied to her childhood and the people who shaped her.\n\nIn the conclusion, Death revisits Liesel's life, illustrating the impact of her story. He reflects on the enduring nature of human connections and the stories that shape our lives.\n\nDeath\n\n Death, the collector of souls, narrates the story of a young girl during the horrific times of Nazi Germany and the Second World War. To the reader, Death insists that things \"most definitely can be cheerful\" while relating that they most certainly also cannot be nice. Sometimes Death is \"compelled\" to take action in sympathy with the human story.\n\nLiesel Meminger\n\n The story's protagonist is a girl on the verge of adolescence, with German blonde hair and brown eyes. The Hubermanns foster her after her biological father is taken away by the Nazis before the novel starts, due to being a Communist. Her brother dies and her mother is forced to send her to a foster home to avoid Nazi persecution. Liesel is the titular book thief; fascinated by the power of words, she steals several books throughout the story from a gravedigger, a bonfire, and the mayor's wife, Ilsa Hermann.\n\nHans Hubermann (Papa)\n\n Liesel's foster father and husband to Rosa, Hans was a German soldier during the First World War. He is now an accordion player and painter. He develops a close and loving relationship with Liesel and becomes a source of strength and support for her. Like Liesel, he doesn't have much experience with reading. The two help each other with reading and write all the words they learn on a wall in the basement. He helps Max because Max's father saved Hans in the First World War.\n\nRosa Hubermann (Mama)\n\n Rosa is Liesel's sharp-tongued foster mother. She has a \"wardrobe\" build and a displeased face, five feet tall, brown-grey hair often tightly tied in a bun. Despite her temper, she is a loving wife to Hans and mother to Liesel. To supplement the household income, she does washing and ironing for wealthier households in Molching.\n\nMax Vandenburg\n\n A Jewish fist-fighter who takes refuge from the Nazi regime in the Hubermanns’ basement. He is the son of a First World War German soldier who fought alongside Hans Hubermann, and the two developed a close friendship during the war. He has brown, feather-like hair and swampy brown eyes. During the Nazi reign of terror, Hans agrees to shelter Max and hide him from the Nazi party. During his stay at the Hubermanns' house, Max befriends Liesel, and they share an affinity for words. He writes two books for her and presents her with a sketchbook that contains his life story, which helps Liesel to develop as a writer and reader, which, in turn, saves her life from the bombs falling on her.[1]\n\nRudy Steiner\n\n Liesel's neighbor Rudy has bony legs, blue eyes, lemon-colored hair, and a penchant for getting in the middle of situations when he shouldn't. Despite having the appearance of an archetypal German, he does not support the Nazis. As a relatively poor household member with six children, Rudy is habitually hungry. He is known throughout the neighborhood because of the \"Jesse Owens incident\" in which he colored himself black with charcoal one night and ran one hundred meters at the local sports field. He is academically and athletically gifted which attracts the attention of Nazi Party officials, leading to attempted recruitment. His lack of support for the Nazi party becomes problematic as the story progresses. Rudy becomes Liesel's best friend and later falls in love with her.\n\nIlsa Hermann\n\n The wife of the mayor of Molching who employs Rosa Hubermann. She fell into a state of depression after the death of her only son Johann, in the Great War. Ilsa allows Liesel to visit, read, and steal books from her library. She gives Liesel a little black book which leads the girl to write her own story, \"The Book Thief\".[1]\n\nWerner Meminger (Liesel's brother)\n\n Liesel's little brother who died suddenly on the train with his mother and other sister, was buried in a cemetery near the train tracks. His death is what allowed the first book to be stolen: a gravedigger's manual dropped by a young boy learning to work in the cemetery.[1]\n\nPaula Meminger (Liesel's mother)\n\n Liesel's mother is only mentioned in the story a few times. She sent her children to foster care to save them from Nazi persecution. For a while, Liesel writes letters to her mother thinking there is a chance she is still alive.[1]\n\nHans Jr (Hans' and Rosa's son)\n\n Hans Jr is the son of Hans and Rosa Huberman. He is very supportive of the Nazi party and fights with his father about it frequently. He is eventually sent to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad.[1]\n\nThe book is introduced by the character/narrator Death, which underlines that mortality is very present in the lives of each character. Throughout the novel, the deaths of prominent characters reaffirm the presence of mortality. Because the novel takes place during the Second World War, death and genocide are nearly omnipresent in the novel.\n\nDeath is presented in a manner that is less distant and threatening. Because Death narrates and explains the reasons behind each character's destruction and explains how he feels that he must take the life of each character, Death is given a sense of care rather than fear. At one point, Death states \"even death has a heart,\" which reaffirms that there is a care present in the concept of death and dying.[2]\n\nThroughout the novel, language, reading, and writing are presented as symbolic elements of expression and freedom. They provide identity and personal liberation to those characters who have, or who gain, the power of literacy: \"the true power of words\", and they provide a framework for Liesel's coming of age. At the beginning of the story shortly after her brother's funeral, Liesel finds a book in the snow, one she is unable to read. Under tutelage by her foster father Hans, she slowly learns to read and write. By the end of the novel, her character arc is largely defined by her progress in reading and writing. The development of Liesel's literacy mirrors her physical growth and maturing over the course of the story.[3]\n\nLiteracy skills and vernacular of speech also serve as social markers. Wealthy citizens in the story are often portrayed as literate, as owning books and even their own libraries, while the poor are illiterate and do not own books. Rosa Huberman's abrasive and oft-times scatological speech towards her family and others is emblematic of the despairing lives of the poorer classes.\n\nThe Nazi burning of books in the story represents evil incarnate. Symbolically, Liesel's rescue of a book from a Nazi bonfire represents her reclaiming of freedom and her resistance to being controlled by the all-pervasive state.[2]\n\nIn the midst of war and loss, love is a central theme which acts as a catalyst for change and sacrifice throughout the book. Liesel overcomes her traumas by learning to love and be loved by her foster family and her friends. At the beginning of the novel, Liesel is traumatized not only by the death of her brother and her separation from her only family but also by the larger issues of war-torn Germany and the destruction wrought by the Nazi party. As Liesel's foster father Hans develops a relationship with her, this relationship helps create healing and growth. This pattern is reflected in the dynamic between the Hubermann family and Max. In a society ruled by governmental policies that presume to stand in judgment of who is truly human, the Hubermanns' relationship with Max defies the Nazi regime. Furthermore, the love that Max and Liesel develop through their friendship creates a strong contrast to the fascist hate in the backdrop of the story, especially since Max is Jewish.\n\nThe theme of love also intertwines with the themes of identity and language/reading because all of these themes have the purpose of providing freedom and power in the midst of chaos and control.[2] Liesel's final words in her own written story are \"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\"[1] She has the power to show her love on paper.\n\nUpon release, The Book Thief was generally well-received. According to Book Marks, the book received \"positive\" reviews based on seven critic reviews with three being \"rave\" and four being \"positive\".[4][5] On Bookmarks July/August 2006 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (3.5 out of 5) based on critic reviews with the critical summary stating, \"Zusak, author of I Am the Messenger, took a risk with his second book by making Death an omniscient narrator—and it largely paid off\".[6]\n• 2006: School Library Journal Best Book of the Year\n• 2006: Publishers Weekly Best Children's Book of the Year\n• 2007: Michael L.

Please, trust me. I most definitely can be cheerful. I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that's only the A's. Just don't ask me to be nice. Nice has nothing to do with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n***Reaction to the ***\n\nAFOREMENTIONED fact\n\nDoes this worry you?\n\nI urge you--don't be afraid.\n\nI'm nothing if not fair.\n\n\n\n\n\n--Of course, an introduction.\n\nA beginning.\n\nWhere are my manners?\n\nI could introduce myself properly, but it's not really necessary. You will know me well enough and soon enough, depending on a diverse range of variables. It suffices to say that at some point in time, I will be standing over you, as genially as possible. Your soul will be in my arms. A color will be perched on my shoulder. I will carry you gently away.\n\nAt that moment, you will be lying there (I rarely find people standing up). You will be caked in your own body. There might be a discovery; a scream will dribble down the air. The only sound I'll hear after that will be my own breathing, and the sound of the smell, of my footsteps.\n\nThe question is, what color will everything be at that moment when I come for you? What will the sky be saying?\n\nPersonally, I like a chocolate-colored sky. Dark, dark chocolate. People say it suits me. I do, however, try to enjoy every color I see--the whole spectrum. A billion or so flavors, none of them quite the same, and a sky to slowly suck on. It takes the edge off the stress. It helps me relax.\n\n\n\n\n\n***A SMALL THEORY ***\n\nPeople observe the colors of a day only at its beginnings and ends, but to me it's quite clear that a day merges through a multitude of shades and intonations, with each passing moment. \n\nA single hour can consist of thousands of different colors. \n\nWaxy yellows, cloud-spat blues. Murky darknesses. \n\nIn my line of work, I make it a point to notice them.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I've been alluding to, my one saving grace is distraction. It keeps me sane. It helps me cope, considering the length of time I've been performing this job. The trouble is, who could ever replace me? Who could step in while I take a break in your stock-standard resort-style vacation destination, whether it be tropical or of the ski trip variety? The answer, of course, is nobody, which has prompted me to make a conscious, deliberate decision--to make distraction my vacation. Needless to say, I vacation in increments. In colors.\n\nStill, it's possible that you might be asking, why does he even need a vacation? What does he need distraction from?\n\nWhich brings me to my next point.\n\nIt's the leftover humans.\n\nThe survivors.\n\nThey're the ones I can't stand to look at, although on many occasions I still fail. I deliberately seek out the colors to keep my mind off them, but now and then, I witness the ones who are left behind, crumbling among the jigsaw puzzle of realization, despair, and surprise. They have punctured hearts. They have beaten lungs.\n\nWhich in turn brings me to the subject I am telling you about tonight, or today, or whatever the hour and color. It's the story of one of those perpetual survivors--an expert at being left behind.\n\nIt's just a small story really, about, among other things:\n\n* A girl\n\n* Some words\n\n* An accordionist\n\n* Some fanatical Germans\n\n* A Jewish fist fighter\n\n* And quite a lot of thievery\n\n\n\n\n\nI saw the book thief three times.\n\n\n\n\n\nBESIDE THE RAILWAY LINE\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst up is something white. Of the blinding kind.\n\nSome of you are most likely thinking that white is not really a color and all of that tired sort of nonsense. Well, I'm here to tell you that it is. White is without question a color, and personally, I don't think you want to argue with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n***A REASSURING ANNOUNCEMENT ***\n\nPlease, be calm, despite that previous threat.\n\nI am all bluster--\n\nI am not violent. \n\nI am not malicious.\n\nI am a result.\n\nYes, it was white.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt felt as though the whole globe was dressed in snow. Like it had pulled it on, the way you pull on a sweater. Next to the train line, footprints were sunken to their shins. Trees wore blankets of ice.\n\nAs you might expect, someone had died.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey couldn't just leave him on the ground. For now, it wasn't such a problem, but very soon, the track ahead would be cleared and the train would need to move on.\n\nThere were two guards.\n\nThere was one mother and her daughter.\n\nOne corpse.\n\nThe mother, the girl, and the corpse remained stubborn and silent.\n\n\"Well, what else do you want me to do?\"\n\nThe guards were tall and short. The tall one always spoke first, though he was not in charge. He looked at the smaller, rounder one. The one with the juicy red face.\n\n\"Well,\" was the response, \"we can't just leave them like this, can we?\"\n\nThe tall one was losing patience. \"Why not?\"\n\nAnd the smaller one damn near exploded. He looked up at the tall one's chin and cried, \"Spinnst du! Are you stupid?!\" The abhorrence on his cheeks was growing thicker by the moment. His skin widened. \"Come on,\" he said, traipsing over the snow. \"We'll carry all three of them back on if we have to. We'll notify the next stop.\"\n\nAs for me, I had already made the most elementary of mistakes. I can't explain to you the severity of my self-disappointment. Originally, I'd done everything right:\n\nI studied the blinding, white-snow sky who stood at the window of the moving train. I practically inhaled it, but still, I wavered. I buckled--I became interested. In the girl. Curiosity got the better of me, and I resigned myself to stay as long as my schedule allowed, and I watched.\n\nTwenty-three minutes later, when the train was stopped, I climbed out with them.\n\nA small soul was in my arms.\n\nI stood a little to the right.\n\nThe dynamic train guard duo made their way back to the mother, the girl, and the small male corpse. I clearly remember that my breath was loud that day. I'm surprised the guards didn't notice me as they walked by. The world was sagging now, under the weight of all that snow.\n\nPerhaps ten meters to my left, the pale, empty-stomached girl was standing, frost-stricken.\n\nHer mouth jittered.\n\nHer cold arms were folded.\n\nTears were frozen to the book thief's face.The Book Thief: Just to clarify: Yes, I did cry.\n\n\n\nI've read a lot of positive and negative reviews for this book. I can see why people wouldn't like it - I really can. Perhaps because I took a lot out of it personally, I found I enjoyed it a lot.\n\n\n\nQuick test to see if you'll like this book:\n\n\n\n1. Did you like Anne of Green Gables?\n\n2. Can you cope with an off-beat, melancholy, caustic, dead-pan, self-righteous narrator?\n\n3. Do you like words?\n\n(Questions 4-8 were all about what kind of underwear you're wearing so don't worry about them).\n\n\n\nSo, let's all gather around for story time with Mistress Kat.\n\n\n\nTwo incidents set me off lately.\n\n\n\n1. My neighbour came to me and complained about the Islanders (for those not Australian: the Tongan, Fiji, Papa New Guinea and New Zealand populations of Australia) causing trouble and otherwise defiling our great and beautiful nation.\n\n2. I was tooling around on Facebook when I noticed one of my friends (one of those friends you’ve never met except in an internet community) hosting a link to a video of a speech from a man addressing the American people. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that he is reminiscent of a neo-Hitler but let’s just say that the comparison would not be wholly unearned. Her comments on the video were that: everything he’d said was right, it was time that people sat up and listened for the sake of their country and that it’s about time “somebody did something”. (Fuck me, I’ve heard this phrase so many times. What is it exactly that they’re referring to? Do they actually know? I’ve yet to hear them pronounce what this “something” is or what it looks like. Is there some plan that I’m not aware of that they’re referring to? Does it involve chipmunks, honey and tequila?)\n\n\n\nTo my neighbour, I simply mumbled that I had to leave and got in my car. I was offended on behalf of my friends so I blew him off and I haven’t really spoken to him since. To my Facebook friend, I resisted the urge to make any comments. I debated about starting a fight that would, in all likelihood, spill over to our community. In the end I ignored her and I haven’t spoken to her since.\n\n\n\nThe Book Thief is not your typical WWII story. It doesn’t even ask you to sympathize with the Jews. Their plight is background to the story and their struggles and pains are rarely shown except through the pitiful/beautiful character of Max. This story actually focuses on the bad guys. Zusak assumes that you know about the struggle and the plight of the Jews. He assumes that you feel for them, that you are horrified on their behalf and so he doesn’t spend much time eliciting an emotion that you are expected to have.\n\n\n\nInstead it focuses on the BAD guys. You get to know and live the lives of a small and poor town in Germany. The thing is, though, that these aren’t really the bad guys. Zusak, probably rightly, assumes that we’d never be able to really empathize and enjoy reading a book about characters truly bad. They’re not really bad. After all, they may be Germans and they may have escaped persecution and death, but they’re still poor. They’re the tiny fraction of the German population who sympathizes with the Jews. They harbour a Jewish man in their home and come to love him. The thing is though that for most of the novel, they’re not the good guys either. They don’t speak up for the Jewish people, they don’t try to change popular opinion, they don’t stand for what’s right. They quietly try to get by without causing waves and without risking much of themselves.\n\n\n\nSo you can see how I would sympathize. How could I think that I’m one of the “good guys” when I don’t stand up for people either? Shouldn’t I have challenged my neighbour and asked how he knew that the Islanders were to blame for all the crime? Shouldn’t I have asked him how many Islanders he knew? How he could make such assumptions about people? Shouldn’t I have challenged my facebook friend? Shouldn’t I have asked her why she’s spreading propaganda? Couldn’t I have probed her to think critically about this man’s claims, about facts and ethics? \n\n\n\nNo. I didn’t want to cause problems and I didn’t want to make waves.\n\n\n\nThe narrator of The Book Thief makes a claim that Hitler’s took over a country and started a war – not with guns or weapons but with words. I’ve read others consider this claim to be stupid and ridiculous but I actually agree with him. \n\n\n\nWhen I was a child I asked my Great Aunt Nell why she insisted on engaging me in long and tedious hypothetical debates about morality, human nature, ethics and theology. Her response was always the same: if you don’t fill a child’s head with all the right stuff, someone will come along and fill it with all the wrong stuff. It’s kind of like those corny motivational quotes that the teachers post in their rooms: Those who stand for nothing fall for anything.\n\n\n\nWell, I agree. When you don’t educate people, when you don’t teach them to think critically, with full understanding and proper knowledge, then other people come along and whisper in their ear and fill their heads up with mindless rot. Hitler told the German people how to think. He told them who was Wrong. Why they were Wrong. How to fix the Wrong. What was Right. Then he did the most powerful thing a person could do: he told them a story. When you tell a whole nation a story about the future – a gloriously bright future with Plenty and Joy; a future in which they are redeemed and have conquered their enemies; a future in which they are happy and Everything Is As It Should Be – and if you tell that story well enough, then you can conquer a country and wage a war without ever firing a single bullet. \n\n\n\nCoincidently when you don’t speak up, when you don’t proclaim the truth, when you’re too afraid to replace ignorance with knowledge then you’re no better than an accomplice to a crime. I can’t imagine how my friends would feel if they’d known that I stood by and allowed them and their family and children to be slandered like that. Pretty appalled, I imagine – and rightfully so.\n\n\n\nAnd now we come to the big reason why I think a lot of people didn’t like this book – the narrator.\n\n\n\nThe Hunger Games did a similar thing to The Book Thief. It sought to instil in its readers a sense of proper shame. However, as opposed to The Book Thief, you didn’t feel judged. After all, for the Sins that The Hunger Games was preaching of, we’re all guilty – and in our combined guilt there seems to be a lessening of accountability. Perhaps there’s a sense that we’re all going down together. When we’re damned, at least we’ll have good company, right? The Book Thief, however, singles you out as solely responsible. It strips you naked and looks down on you as it asks you to account of yourself. Not even the narrator can sympathize with you because he is the only one left blameless and innocent, looking upon us with a reserved kind of pity and bewilderment. \n\n\n\nMaybe I’m a glutton for punishment. I don’t mind being stripped down. I don’t mind being reprimanded and so I loved this book. I loved this book for inspiring me to be even more outlandishly outspoken and persistently and doggedly forthcoming on my opinions of these issues. I loved this book because I loved the narrator. I loved this book because I loved the story. \n\n\n\nI loved this book because I now have the PERFECT excuse to start a helluva lot more fights. \n\n\n\nFor some reason, that thought makes me very happy.The Book Thief (2013) ⭐ 7.5 | Drama, War: If this film is not on most Top 10 Lists then what I think about critics will hold. As the saying goes \" I laughed, I cried, i felt good. This film shows hope in the face of the worst that life serves up, and wants you to come back for more. The acting from top to bottom was fantastic. Geoffrey Rush gives a wonderful performance that should get him an Oscar nomination. This is by no means a feel good movie, and I wouldn't bring younger kids to see it, but it will make them think about. Best of all look for the answer to the many questions this film should leave in their minds. Questions of did this happen, and if it did, WHY? I like that as in other films about this time, it focused on the ordinary people of Germany not just the victims of the Holocaust. How their lives were touched by the insanity of the masses and how some never lost sight of what it was to care about others."}

Su población era de 84.132 habitantes en 2010.\n\nKaspisk fue fundada en 1932, por lo que es uno de los lugares más recientemente fundados de Daguestán. Originalmente se estableció en el lugar un asentamiento obrero llamado Dvigatelstrói (Дви́гательстро́й), que literalmente significa \"construcción de motores\". Este asentamiento fue construido por la necesidad de un lugar para la construcción de motores, originalmente sobre todo diésel, para la construcción de barcos. Por otro lado, el inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial convirtió a la localidad rápidamente en un importante centro productor de armamento. En 1947 recibió el estatus de ciudad y el nombre de Kaspisk.\n\nEn el periodo de posguerra Kaspisk se desarrolló como emplazamiento industrial y como suburbio obrero de Majachkalá. Su población creció de alrededor de 25.200 habitantes en 1959 a 49.400 en 1979.\n\nEn la década de 1990 y en la de 2000 Kaspisk fue lugar de ataques durante la Primera y en la segunda guerra chechena: un bombardeo de casas de militares cometido aparentemente por guerrilleros chechenos el 16 de noviembre de 1996 causó 68 muertos,[1]​ y el 9 de mayo de 2002, durante el desfile del Día de la Victoria, una bomba mató a 43 personas.[2]​\n\nEn la ciudad se halla un gran depósito de la marina rusa, que alberga aerodeslizadores y ekranoplanos.\n\nLa composición de la población de Kaspisk en 2002 era la que sigue:\n\nLas principales compañías de la ciudad son:\n• AOOT Dagdizel (АООТ Дагдизель), fundada en 1935, fabrica motores diésel y eléctricos, torpedos y otros equipos para la Armada de Rusia[1].\n• OAO Zavod Tochnoi Mejaniki (ОАО Завод точной механики), fundada en 1952, fabrica equipos de navegación para la marina militar, comercial y de pesca.\n\nTambién tienen su relevancia una fábrica de ladrillos y una de procesado de la piedra.\n\nAl norte de la ciudad se encuentra el puerto.

At this time, he was a major proponent of the modernist style which made its breakthrough in Sweden at the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930). Asplund was professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology from 1931. His appointment was marked by a lecture, later published under the title \"Our architectonic concept of space.\"[1] The Woodland Crematorium at Stockholm South Cemetery (1935-1940) is considered his finest work and one of the masterpieces of modern architecture.[2]\n\nAmong Asplund's most important works is the Stockholm Public Library, constructed between 1924 and 1928, which stands as the prototypical example of the Nordic Classicism and so-called Swedish Grace movement. It was particularly influential on the proposal submitted for the competition for the design of the Viipuri Library in 1927 by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, who regarded Asplund as his mentor.[3]\n\nAnother important work is the extension of the Gothenburg City Hall Extension building which Asplund started on 1913 and finished 1937 - it shows his transformation from neo-classical to functionalist architect, a transformation in parallel with other European modernists like Erich Mendelsohn.\n\nAsplund collaborated with architect Sigurd Lewerentz in the design of Skogskyrkogården, a cemetery which is a UNESCO world heritage site, created between 1914 and 1940. They were also the main architects for the temporary Stockholm International Exhibition (1930). Although temporary, the modernist, exposed-glass-and-steel-frame Entry Pavilion at the fair was internationally influential. In fact, it was influential already before its completion, having an influence on the much smaller Turku Fair in Finland, designed by Alvar Aalto and Erik Bryggman, who had travelled to Stockholm to see its construction.[4]\n\nGunnar Asplund is considered perhaps the most important modernist Swedish architect and has had a major influence on later generations of Swedish and Nordic architects.[5]\n\nThe lecture \"Our architectonic concept of space\" was delivered in 1931 on the occasion of Asplund being appointed professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Asplund published few theoretical texts. The lecture was later regarded as an important contribution to the attitudes of Asplund, as well as others of his generation, towards the architectural problems of the time. The lecture has its background in the then well known 2-volume book by German philosopher Oswald Spengler \"The decline of the West\" (1918 and 1922).[6]\n• 1922 sketch by Gunnar Asplund of the interior of the Skandia cinema, Stockholm\n• The Architecture of Gunnar Asplund, MoMA, New York (1978)\n• En chantier: The Collections of the CCA, 1989-1999, Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal (1999-2000)\n• 75 Years of Architecture at MoMA, MoMA, New York (2007-2008)\n• In Situ: Architecture and Landscape, MoMA, New York (2009-2010)\n• Website with several photos about Asplunds work on Stockholm Public Library\n• Further mentions/photos about his major masterpiece Stockholm Public Library\n• Gunnar Asplund at the Museum of Modern Art\n• Finding aid for the Erik Gunnar Asplund collection, Canadian Centre for Architecture.Spotlight: Gunnar Asplund: As a professor of architecture at the Royal Institute of Technology, and a designer often cited for his contributions to Nordic Classicism, Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund (September 22 1885 – 20 October 1940) was a notable theorist on the most important architectural challenges of his time, first exemplified by his lecture entitled “Our Architectonic Concept of Space.”\n\nAsplund is considered one of the most influential modernist architects of Sweden and was a proponent of the modernist style first seen at the Stockholm International Exhibition of 1930. He completed numerous works regarded as prototypical examples of Nordic Classicism and the so-called Swedish Grace movement, including the Stockholm Public Library.\n\nOther notable works include the extension of the Gothenburg Courthouse and his collaboration with architect Sigurd Lewerentz for the design of Skogskyrkogården cemetery.\n\nAcclaimed Finnish architect Alvaar Alto regarded Asplund as a mentor, modeling the initial designs for his Viipuri Library after Asplund's Nordic Classicism.\n\nClick the links below to find out more about Gunnar Asplund's most famous work, the Stockholm Public Library, as well as more on recent renovation plans for the building.The Woodland Cemetery in Stockholm by Erik Gunnar Asplund & Sigurd Lewerentz: The Woodland Cemetery, or Skogskyrkogården, in Stockholm, is a distinctive blend of architecture and nature, a result of the meticulous design by renowned architects Erik Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz. This cemetery, a product of their winning entry in an international competition in 1915, began construction in 1917 and was completed in phases over several years, with the first phase finished in 1920.\n\nThe cemetery’s design, harmoniously combining architectural structures with the surrounding landscape, was influenced mainly by German forest cemeteries like Friedhof Ohlsdorf in Hamburg and Waldfriedhof in Munich, as well as the neoclassical paintings of Caspar David Friedrich. Notable features include a long route through the cemetery, splitting into two paths that lead through diverse landscapes and architectural elements before rejoining, a distinctive granite cross, and the Resurrection Chapel​.\n\nSkogskyrkogården came about following an international competition in 1915 to design a new cemetery in Enskede in the southern part of Stockholm, Sweden. The entry called “Tallum” by the young architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz was selected. The commission would span their entire careers, reflecting stylistic developments and shifts over a twenty-five-year period.\n\nAsplund and Lewerentz’s competitor entry for the Woodland Cemetery, which was chosen over fifty-five other entries, clearly stands cut in its intense romantic naturalism. The winning scheme was the only one that turned the existing, essentially untouched Nordic forest on the site into the dominant experience.\n\nThe architects’ use of the natural landscape created an extraordinary tranquil beauty environment that had a profound influence on cemetery design throughout the world. The basis for the route through the cemetery is a long route leading from the ornamental colonnaded entrance that then splits, one way leading through a pastoral landscape, complete with a large pond and a tree-lined meditation hill, and the other up to a large detached granite cross and the abstract portico of the crematorium and the chapels of the Holy Cross, Faith, and Hope.\n\nWhile civilized and well-groomed English parks mixed with allées on-axis, and informal and formal open areas were features typical of the other competitors, Asplund and Lewerentz evoked a much more primitive imagery. The intervention of footpaths, which meandered freely through the forest, was minimal. Graves were freely and informally to be laid among the existing wild forest.\n\nThe interventions they allowed themselves, such as the molding of the two old gravel pits and the ordering of the area surrounding the main chapel, became all the more charged because they existed hidden within and in contrast to the raw and untouched forest surrounding them. This contrast is well captured in their as yet romantic competition sketches.\n\nDesigned by Lewerentz and completed in 1925, the Chapel of Resurrection has the look of a neoclassicist temple. Soon after the Woodland Chapel was inaugurated, it became clear that it was too small, so Sigurd Lewerentz was commissioned to design a larger stone chapel in the southern part of Skogskyrkogården.\n\nMounted on twelve columns, the portico leads visitors into the quiet chapel with its attractive mosaic floor and many fine details. The elegant single-window signifies the importance of the chapel as a link with heaven. The organ gallery is high up and hidden from view so that heavenly music can rain down on the mourners.\n\nTheir proposal for the chapel – “a synthesis of temple and hut,” according to the architectural historian Caroline Constant—was directly inspired by a vernacular cottage in Liselund, Denmark, which Asplund visited on his honeymoon in 1918. The chapel is set in a pine forest. A path leads through the wood to the entrance, where the dominant form is a steeply pitched shingle roof, a massive shape like a truncated pyramid supported by columns. The deep portico continues the darkness of the forest. Only when the doors to the chapel are open is the visitor presented with a light-filled interior.\n\nThe Service building (which now hosts the visitor center) was designed by Gunnar Asplund and has puzzled many people due to its unusual design. In contrast with most buildings of this category, the architect clearly succeeds avoiding banality.\n\nThe one-story wooden building is of an extraordinary, playful shape. It is made of four square pavilions with steeply pointed tent roofs clad in sheet metal. Another volume with a flat roof separates the four pavilions. The building is painted entirely in green with white window frames and a high chimney in red brick.\n\nAsplund devoted himself mainly to the buildings. The small Woodland Crematorium — built in 1935–40 — has been regarded as a central work in his oeuvre and the Nordic Classicism style of that period. The small chapel, set on a Tuscan peristyle and featuring a gold statue on the roof by Carl Milles, was, in fact, derived from a “primitive hut” that Asplund had happened to see in a garden at Liselund.\n\nWith its Faith, Hope, and Holy Cross Chapels, the crematorium was Asplund’s final work of architecture, designed in a rational modernist style typical for his later work, opened shortly before his death in 1940.\n\nAsplund (1885—1940) is considered one of the great architects of the interwar period and also played a key role in the development of other Nordic countries. He was one of the leading proponents of 1920s neoclassicism and also one of the pioneers of functionalism. His buildings are often shaped around the experience of the interior and the building’s inner sanctums. This is particularly true of the Stockholm Public Library, where he developed distinctive space and light attributes.\n\nWorks from Erik Gunnar Asplund\n\nSigurd Lewerentz (1885—1975) was involved in shaping the 20th century’s architecture early on but did not achieve the same immediate recognition that his colleague Gunnar Asplund enjoyed. His genius was really only recognized much later on, particularly in his churches Markus Church in Björkhagen and St Petri Church in Klippan, which brought him his own acclaim. To this day, he remains one of Sweden’s most celebrated architects abroad.Erik \"Gunnar\" Asplund Online Shop | Buy Vintage at PAMONO: Born in Stockholm in 1885, architect-designer Erik \"Gunnar\" Asplund is celebrated as the godfather of functionalist design in Sweden.\n\nAfter studying painting at Stockholm’s Royal University College of Fine Arts (1905-09), Asplund’s avid interest in architecture led him to attend the Stockholm Free Architecture School and to open his own practice. His early architectural works represented a pared-down neoclassical style, which was inspired by several class trips to Greece and Italy (1912-14). Exemplary of the romantic, Swedish Grace movement, his Scandia Cinema (1922-1923) and Stockholm City Library (1924-1928) emphasize geometric simplicity and clarity of form. Asplund’s Senna Chair (1915) was specifically designed for the library.\n\nIt wasn’t until the last decade of his life that Asplund became a major proponent for the functionalist style, when he was appointed Chief Architect of the watershed 1930 Stockholm Exhibition, organized by the Swedish Society for Arts & Crafts and credited with introducing modernism to Swedish society. Asplund’s contributions to the fair, including his Paradise Café and Entry Pavilion, presented a machine aesthetic couched in socially democratic ideals and optimism about the future.\n\nOther designs in Asplund’s repertoire include the Villa Sturegarden in Nykoping (1913), the Gothenburg Courthouse Extension (1913-37)—which aptly shows his transformation from neoclassical to functionalist architecture—and the Skogskyrkogården Woodland Cemetery in Stockholm (1915-1940, with architect Sigurd Lewerentz). The latter was declared a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 1944. His best known furniture designs include the tubular steel Karmstol Side Chair for Nordiska Kompaniet (1931); GA-2 Armchair for Nordiska Kompaniet (1931)—later for Källemo—and the Gotebor Chair designed 1934-37 and produced by Cassina from 1983.\n\nFollowing the success of the Stockholm Exhibition, Asplund became a professor of architecture at his alma mater. He passed away in 1940. Asplund’s life and work served as inspiration to a number of Scandinavian design luminaries, such as lifelong friend and mentee Alvar Aalto, as well as Erik Bryggman and Arne Jacobsen.Category:John Settergren - Wikimedia Commons: This category has the following 2 subcategories, out of 2 total.septembre en basque - Français-Basque dictionnaire | Glosbe: Peter O'Mahony, né le 17 septembre 1989 à Cork, est un joueur irlandais de rugby à XV évoluant au poste de troisième ligne aile.\n\nLe Dniepr possède un régime nival de plaine avec une période de hautes eaux au printemps au moment de la fonte des neiges (débit mensuel de 2 893 m3/s en mai) et une période d'étiage en automne (débit mensuel de 841 m3/s en septembre).\n\nFreddie Oversteegen est née le 6 septembre 1925 dans le village de Schoten (nl), aux Pays-Bas .\n\nAprès les vagues de chaleur et les feux de forêt qui ont sévi en Suède durant l'été 2018, Greta Thunberg, alors en neuvième année, décide dès le 20 août 2018 de ne pas aller à l'école jusqu'aux élections législatives suédoises du 9 septembre 2018.\n\nLe 29 septembre 1869, la famille déménage provisoirement à Genève où en plus des cours particuliers, il suit l'enseignement de l'Académie publique.\n\nL'opération Ruban jaune (en anglais Operation Yellow Ribbon) est le nom de l'opération que Transports Canada mit sur pied pour gérer le déroutage des vols civils à la suite des attaques du 11 septembre 2001.\n\nDans un village du Sud de la France, en septembre 1960.\n\nCette cession, décidée au traité d'Arras de 1435 devait compenser l’assassinat de Jean sans Peur à Montereau, le 10 septembre 1419.\n\nFlorence Griffith-Joyner, née Delorez Florence Griffith le 21 décembre 1959 à Los Angeles et morte le 21 septembre 1998 à Mission Viejo en Californie, est une athlète américaine, spécialiste du sprint.\n\nLes républicains modérés organisent en septembre 1797 un coup d'État qui chasse deux des cinq directeurs et destitue ou invalide l'élection de 177 députés.\n\nElle part ensuite pour Santa Barbara, où elle est arrêtée le 23 septembre 1943 pour consommation illégale d'alcool par une mineure ;

The pressure supplied by the grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a check valve to prevent grease escaping back out of the fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting so that it can be wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing.\n\nThe common convex shape of the fitting allows the simple concave tip of the grease gun to seal against the fitting easily from many angles, yet with a sufficiently tight seal to force the pressured grease to move the ball and enter the fitting, rather than simply oozing past this temporary annular (ring-shaped) seal. For higher pressure greasing, the grease gun end latches onto the nipple and sealing is effected as a butt joint. If this type of gun end is not perfectly aligned with the nipple, they leak. Once greasing is completed, the latched on nozzle can be released by angling the nozzle over to break the seal with the nipple. Once the seal is broken, the pressure in the nozzle is released thus releasing the latching fingers.\n\nA less common design has a few names including 'button head', 'threepenny bit', 'flat' and 'tat head'. These are a larger nipple head with a flat sealing surface which overhangs the body of the nipple allowing the grease gun end to be hooked onto the nipple with a sliding action which wipes the nipple surface as it's attached. The grease gun hose is usually at a sharp angle (e.g. 70-90°) to the axis of the nipple but can be approached from any azimuthal angle. It is not possible for grease pressure to force this type of connector away from the nipple.\n\nGrease fittings are commonly made from zinc-plated steel, stainless steel, or brass.\n\nThe patent for the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the assignee was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation.[1] Alemite had already been marketing, since 1919,[2] ball check valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups, but Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these grease fittings.\n\nBefore Zerk fittings existed, bearings were lubricated in various other ways that tended to be more maintenance-intensive and often provided less effective lubrication. For example, a typical machinery bearing of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a plain bearing with a cross-drilled hole to receive oil or grease, with no clever fitting at its mouth, or at best a cap or cup. Often lubricant was delivered under no more pressure than gravity or a finger push might provide. For example, oil was gravity-fed into the hole, or grease was pushed in. Grease guns to feed the grease with higher pressure existed,[1] but their pre-Zerk fittings were not as good for making clean, sealed contact easily, and they were less widely used than today.\n\nThe oil hole or grease hole was usually covered with a cap of some kind to keep dirt out, from a simple plug or screw to a spring-loaded hinged cap. Sometimes a cup was mounted, acting as a small reservoir, which would weep oil slowly or could be turned at regular intervals to inject grease into the fitting. The standard mode of maintenance was to have each machine's operator, or a dedicated oiler, go around adding a small squirt of oil or blob of grease to each and every hole or cup on a frequent basis.\n\nTypical frequencies for oiling were one oil squirt (to every bearing) for each day of use, or in some cases each week. Grease is essentially oil held in a viscous gel or cream whose viscosity is used to hold the oil over time in places where oil alone cannot be supplied constantly enough, and would quickly drip away without the viscous suspension. This trait makes it better for bearings that cannot practically receive new oil on a near-constant basis. Thus a typical frequency for greasing might be monthly, yearly, or every several years.\n\nIf the lubrication schedule was faithfully and conscientiously adhered to, the lubrication quality could be very good. Large marine engines and stationary engines to power whole factories were likeliest to get such top-quality care. But locomotives, rail cars, agricultural implements, and automobiles were less certain of good care, and lubrication quality without constant lubing tended to be intermittent, from mediocre to bad. Attempts to improve on the simple oil hole concept included putting a small reservoir of oil above the hole, which slowly dripped oil into it. An example is the Lunkenheimer oiler in the nearby image. Such oilers often incorporated one or more of the following features:\n• A wick (to hold the oil and allow it to be drawn down slowly by capillary action, just as an oil-lamp wick or candle wick fed oil or melted wax to its flame\n• A fine mesh screen to act as a filter to keep dirt from getting down the hole\n• A glass cup rather than a metal one, which allowed an operator or oiler to see at a glance how low the oil level was\n\nFor greased bearings, the low pressures of lubrication before the grease fitting could often result in a failure of the grease to travel all the way down into all the voids of the bearing. The grease fitting improved this penetration, yielding more effective lubrication.\n\nSince the 1920s, the ever-growing proliferation of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries has made the use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.\n\nNorton Commando motorcycles (1967–1975) had a 'grease' nipple fitted to the swing arm assembly but heavy gear box oil was stipulated by the factory. The subsequent confusion by owners (who assumed that the presence of an Alemite/Zerk-type fitting implied that grease was intended) often resulted in grease being used (causing rapid wear of the pivot bushes). The same error was made on some models of machine tools with Alemite/Zerk-type fittings for their way oil.Zerk 25 Backpack: I also have the Gossamer Gear Loris 25. They are both nice packs and if I could only combine the features of the two I would have the perfect pack.\n\nI like the removable pad, and the zippered pockets on the hip belt on the Loris. but I like the colors, the lid with storage, and the shoulder straps of the Zerk. What to do?Mountainsmith Zerk 40L Review: Ultralight Pack, Vest-Style Straps: During the past hiking season I’ve used the Mountainsmith Zerk 40L Pack for about 300 trail miles on the PCT in Washington and Oregon; in the many ecosystems of Olympic National Park; and on the Wonderland Trail around Mount Rainier. Not included in those 300 miles are the numerous shakedown hikes I took the Zerk on in my home state of Colorado.\n\nThis was my first experience with a frameless pack and I was pleasantly surprised. Being that the Zerk 40L Pack was designed by a human about three times my size (Jaba aka The Real Hiking Viking), I was legitimately concerned with how the pack would carry on my small frame. Luckily, the Zerk’s features seem to translate well to different body types.\n\nOne of the first things you’ll notice when you look at the Zerk is the massive running-vest style shoulder straps. Being that this is a frameless pack, so virtually all of the load is taken on by the shoulder straps, it’s quite nice that they are so incredibly supportive. As a small guy, I felt like my entire torso was embraced by the pack and that the weight was evenly distributed over my whole core rather than just my shoulders. \n\n\n\nFurthermore, the back panel doesn’t have a traditional internal frame, but it does include a “removable interior laser cut frame sheet (EVA Atilon)”. This tiny frame sheet provides a modicum of rigidity that is just enough to make the hip belt useful. It’s not going to be the same as having a frame but I noticed, in a pinch, I could tighten up the hip belt and transfer some weight to my hips.\n\nA note on the weight this pack can carry: Mountainsmith rates the Zerk 40L with a maximum carry weight of 30lbs. I'm sure that’s nothing for the Real Hiking Viking, but I found anything more than 20-22lbs to be uncomfortable for me.\n\nThis pack has some pretty smart storage features. Since you lose any hip belt pocket storage with the minimalist webbing belt, they have consciously made up for it by adding some intelligently placed elastic pockets. The shoulder straps have 2-layered elastic mesh pockets on both sides. I have used them to hold my phone, on-the-go snacks, occasionally a map, and even a 1-liter smartwater bottle. \n\n\n\nThe side pockets are also double-layered. They’re big enough to hold two 1-liter smartwater bottles, and still be able to slide a thin item like a pocket-sized guidebook or some protein bars in the second layer. This is the first time I’ve seen these layered side pockets on a pack and I think it’s pretty clever.\n\n\n\n\n\nMountainsmith generously provides a couple of optional features such as the front panel attachment bungee system, and some extra overtop webbing straps for a bear canister or big bag of potato chips. The hip belt is also removable.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed having the bungee system and the hip belt. I didn’t use the extra overtop straps, since the pack includes a single, centered overtop strap, as well.\n\nAt $219.95, it’s a pretty great deal assuming that you have your ultralight kit pretty dialed in. But then again, if you’re serious enough about backpacking to own expensive ultralight gear, do you care about saving an extra $100 on a pack? Either way, you’re getting a lot for the price — a thoughtfully designed pack conceived by experienced hikers. \n\n\n\nI’ll admit, I’m not a fabric expert, but I am hard on gear and so far this pack is holding up nicely. I have yet to put any major wear on the fabric, seams, or mesh of this pack. I even saw a few well-seasoned Zerks on the backs of PCT thru-hikers in Washington, and they all seemed to be holding up well. \n\n\n\nThe main body is constructed with 210D EXTREEMA Recycled Nylon Ripstop. Although the EXTREEMA fabric sounds kind of like Dyneema, it is not related. EXTREEMA is water resistant, but not completely waterproof. However, it will probably keep your stuff dry in a light or quick rain, and doesn’t carry the high price tag of Dyneema.\n\nNo Buckle on the Side Straps\n\nI’ve gotta say, this annoyed me multiple times on trail when I wanted to quickly stow away my trekking poles. Instead of being able to stow them mid-stride, pack still on, I needed to stop, take my pack off, and slide my trekking poles through the top of the straps down into the side pocket. If you don’t carry poles or don’t stow them often, it’s not a big deal; but I think if Mountainsmith addressed this issue, it would significantly increase the functionality of the pack. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hip Belt Could Be More Padded\n\n\n\nI love that the back panel has a thin frame sheet, but I think it could be better utilized by making the hipbelt a hair beefier.\n\n\n\nThe folks over at Mountainsmith seem to be putting some serious practical thought into their gear designs. I’ve met some of them in person, and we shared backpacking stories, and bounced gear preferences and ideas back and forth. It’s nice to know that their gear is being designed by people who are actually getting out there and putting it to the test.\n\nWith any frameless pack I would say to know your physical limit on how much you’re willing to carry on your shoulders. For me, this pack maxed out around 22lbs, but you may be comfortable carrying more or less.\n\nAll in all, this is a comfortable ultralight pack with a lot of handy features that aren’t widely available elsewhere. It strikes a beautiful balance between simplicity and practicality. I’ll still keep my framed packs around, but the Zerk 40L is now my go-to pack for fast-packing and ultralight, warm-weather backpacking trips.2024 Zerk 40 Backpack: [{\"id\":234523754648,\"handle\":\"backpacks\",\"title\":\"BACKPACKS\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-01-17T08:40:11-07:00\",\"body_html\":\"\",\"published_at\":\"2021-01-06T08:59:31-07:00\",\"sort_order\":\"manual\",\"template_suffix\":\"\",\"disjunctive\":false,\"rules\":[{\"column\":\"tag\",\"relation\":\"equals\",\"condition\":\"Shop: Backpacks\"}],\"published_scope\":\"web\",\"image\":{\"created_at\":\"2021-01-06T11:27:37-07:00\",\"alt\":null,\"width\":2000,\"height\":797,\"src\":\"\\/\\/mountainsmith.com\\/cdn\\/shop\\/collections\\/Backpacks_collection.jpg?v=1610908152\"}},{\"id\":442777567465,\"handle\":\"black-friday-sale-25-off\",\"title\":\"Black Friday Sale (25% off)\",\"updated_at\":\"2025-01-21T10:30:08-07:00\",\"body_html\":\"\\u003cp class=\\\"MsoNormal\\\"\\u003eGear up for the holidays with our exclusive sitewide sale featuring products that rarely go on sale!

durability, comfort, and accessibility. New updated version includes added daisy chain attachment points, dual ice axe loops, dual side compression straps, and embroidered design. The Zerk 40 was awarded The Best Fast and Light Pack by The Trek. It is featured in their Best Backpacks for Thru-Hiking of 2022 . The Zerk 40 was awardedby The Trek. It is featured in their Co-designed with The Real Hiking Viking, a prominent long distance hiking machine, this pack was developed over two years with one mission; to go faster, further, and lighter. After over5000 miles of testing in the Rockies, this pack is on its 5th generation of design upgrades. Built withultra-light and durable materials, the Zerk 40 will be your best friend and greatest asset when out on the trail.\n• Large main compartment holds up to 40 liters of gear\n• Large side water bottle pockets with angled opening to easily remove and insert items while on the go\n• Front cord loops can be configured with bungee cord (included)\n• Removable interior laser cut frame sheet (EVA Atilon) allows for rigidity and airflow Perfect pack for me Planning to do the Camino de Santiago and needed a versatile lightweight backpack. The Zerk 40 is perfect for what I need. Duper comfortable and versatile with all of the capacity and extra pockets. Top Notch Quality. I normally go ultra light but during the cooler weather here in Florida I needed a larger pack. Especially one that will comfortably take a few bulkier winter items like a quilt for my hammock and long sleeve shirts for me. Didn't need a fancy one with all the bells and whistles , just one that's proven to be practical and works. I have other Mountainsmith products and all of them are top notch , quality items. Absolutely perfect! This backpack is *solid* and the perfect solution for lightweight to ultra lightweight hiking. I've loaded the pack with 30 lbs of content plus various extra things hanging off it (stove, fuel bottle, sleeping bag). Very comfortable even this loaded, the weight mostly transfers to the chest area. The multiple options for closing the roll-top and the webbing for attaching multiple items by carabiner are super convenient as is the front pocket for easy access to items (I stick extra socks, a hat gloves and my emergency med kit here). The side and chest strap pockets are also a big win, all can be accessed without removing the pack. I am in love with it, I literally can't think of anything wrong with it. One caveat is that I didn't feel much need for the detachable hip belt, but others whose packs are packed with a different weight distribution etc. may find it useful. This is in my top 3 favourite outdoor gear purchases. They thought of everything. For thru-hiking folks this is a revelation. All the pockets can be accessed without taking off the pack which means less opportunity for those mice and squirrels to laser in like they do (IYKYK). Holds a 3.0L bladder easily. Has every attachment point you can ask for as well as an easily removed hip belt. Run the matching bum bag as well for even more utility. They knocked it out the park. This pack is absolutely amazing got my new pack in today as an older fellow at 56 years old I love to go backpacking and through hiking but the weight is just killing me specially the hills so I’m looking to drop weight, starting with my backpack and I do believe I found the pack I was looking for with some changes and gear.

He was a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize in 1951. He was one of the founders of the Italian Republic and a central figure of the Italian political left from the 1920s to the 1960s.\n\nNenni was born in Faenza, in Emilia-Romagna. After his peasant parents died, he was placed in an orphanage by an aristocratic family. Every Sunday, he recited his catechism before the countess and if he did well, he received a silver coin, which he recalled as \"generous but humiliating\".[3]\n\nNenni was affiliated with the Italian Republican Party. In 1908, he became editor of a republican paper in Forlì. The socialist paper in the town was edited at the time by Benito Mussolini, later the Fascist dictator of Italy. In 1909 he entered political life by joining the Italian Republican party. Nenni was arrested in 1911 for his participation in a socialist protest against Italy's imperialistic war in Libya alongside Mussolini and was imprisoned for seven months.[4]\n\nWhen the First World War broke out, Nenni advocated the intervention of Italy in the war. In 1915, he volunteered for the Isonzo front. After he was wounded and sent home, he became an editor of the republican paper Mattine d'Italia. He defended Italy's participation in the war but tried not to alienate his socialist friends. In the last years of the war Nenni served at the front again.[4]\n\nWhen the war was over, Nenni founded, together with some disillusioned revolutionary ex-servicemen, a group called \"Fascio\", which was soon dissolved and replaced by a real Fascist body.[4] While the socialist Mussolini became a fascist, the republican Nenni joined the Socialist Party in 1921 after its split with the wing that would form the Italian Communist Party (PCI).\n\nIn 1923, after the Fascist March on Rome, Nenni became the editor of PSI's official organ, Avanti!, and engaged in antifascist activism. In 1925 he was arrested for publishing a booklet on the fascist murder of Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti. When the Avanti offices were set aflame and the paper prohibited in 1926, he took refuge in France, where he became secretary of the PSI.\n\nNenni had worked in Paris as a correspondent of the Avanti in 1921 and had become acquainted with Léon Blum, Marcel Cachin, Romain Rolland and Georges Sorel. During his Parisian exile, Nenni made a decisive contribution to the survival of the Italian Socialist Party, which had moved abroad, and he worked for an alliance between the various anti-fascist parties which had been driven into exile. In 1935, he helped lead the Italian opposition to Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. Nenni went on to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was the co-founder and the political commissar of the Garibaldi Brigade. After the defeat of the Spanish Republic and the victory of General Francisco Franco he returned to France. In 1943, he was arrested by the Germans in Vichy France and then imprisoned in Italy on the island of Ponza.\n\nNenni's third daughter, Vittoria, was active in the French resistance. She was captured and deported to Auschwitz, where she was murdered on 15 July 1943, aged 28.[5] After being liberated in August 1943, he returned to Rome to lead the Italian Socialist Party, which had been reunified as the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity. After the surrender of Italy with the Allied armed forces on 8 September 1943, he was one of the political officials of the National Liberation Committee, the underground political entity of Italian Partisans during the German occupation.\n\nIn 1944, Nenni became the national secretary of the PSI again, favoring close ties between his party and the PCI. After the Liberation, he took up government responsibilities, becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Constituent Assembly in the government of Ferruccio Parri and the first government of Alcide De Gasperi. He was Minister for the Constitution, and in October 1946 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the second De Gasperi government.\n\nThe close ties between the PSI and the PCI caused the Giuseppe Saragat-led anti-communist wing of the PSI to leave and form the Italian Socialist Workers' Party in 1947 (later merged into the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, PSDI). During the early stage of the cold war he opposed Italy's entry into NATO fearing that it could drag the country into a war between the two Superpowers and reignite the Italian civil war and instead favoured a policy of Neutrality. In 1951 he was awarded the Stalin peace prize.\n\nIn 1956, Nenni broke with the PCI after Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary.[6] He returned the award and donated the Prize money ($25,000) to the International red Cross.[3] Subsequently, he slowly led his party into supporting membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and he sought co-operation with the leading party, the Christian Democrats.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Nenni facilitated an \"opening to the centre-left\" enabling coalition governments between the PSI and the Christian Democrats and leading the socialists back into office for the first time since 1947.[7] He formed a centre-left coalition with Saragat, Aldo Moro and Ugo La Malfa, and favored a reunion with the PSDI. From 1963 to 1968 he was Deputy Prime Minister in the three successive governments led by Moro and in December 1968 he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in the first government of Mariano Rumor, but resigned in July 1969, when the center-left alliance collapsed.[citation needed]\n\nAlthough the reunification attempts between the socialists and Giuseppe Saragat's breakaway Social Democrats resulted in the formation of a joint list Unified PSI–PSDI, both parties fared poorly in the 1968 Italian general election. In 1969, a disillusioned Nenni virtually retired and Francesco De Martino took his place.[8] He resigned as head of the PSI and was made a senator for life in 1970 and in 1971 he ran unsuccessfully for President of Italy. He died in Rome on 1 January 1980. She is commemorated in the writings of Charlotte Delbo.[citation needed] He was an atheist.[9]\n• Address given by Pietro Nenni on the military intervention in Czechoslovakia, Rome, 29 August 1968\n• Newspaper clippings about Pietro Nenni in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBWPietro Nenni | Socialist leader, Italian statesman, anti-fascist | Britannica: Pietro Nenni (born February 9, 1891, Faenza, Italy—died January 1, 1980, Rome) was a journalist and politician who was leader of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), twice foreign minister, and several times vice-premier of Italy.\n\nThe son of a peasant, Nenni first became a journalist. When Italy invaded Libya in September 1911, Nenni organized a strike against the campaign. He was jailed for his activities and met Benito Mussolini in prison. He joined the PSI in 1921. In 1922, when Mussolini came to power, Nenni, an ardent antifascist, attacked him in the newspaper Avanti, of which he was chief editor. In 1925 he was arrested for publishing a booklet on the Fascists’ murder of Socialist leader Giacomo Matteotti, and in the following year, after the suppression of Avanti, he fled to Paris. During the Spanish Civil War, Nenni was cofounder and political commissar of the Garibaldi Brigade. In 1940 he was arrested in Vichy France by the German Gestapo, taken back to Italy in 1943, and interned on the island of Ponza by Mussolini. In August of the same year, he was released by order of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. Nenni was then elected secretary-general of the PSI and in 1945 became vice-premier in the government of Feruccio Parri. Elected to the Constituent Assembly in 1946, he became vice-premier again in Christian Democrat Alcide De Gasperi’s coalition government. In 1946 Nenni was named foreign minister, but in January 1947 the PSI split and Nenni, heading the party’s left wing, made an alliance with the Communists. For almost a decade the alliance opposed Christian Democrat governments.\n\nNenni broke with the Communists after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. In 1963 he finally brought the PSI back into a full-fledged coalition with the Christian Democrats under Aldo Moro. He served as foreign minister in 1968–69 and was vice-premier in three successive cabinets, but, when the centre-left alliance collapsed in 1969, Nenni resigned as head of the PSI. Nenni was made a senator for life in 1970.Pietro Nenni - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Pietro Sandro Nenni (Faenza, 9 de febrero de 1891 - Roma, 1 de enero de 1980) fue un político socialista italiano.[1]​\n\nNacido en Faenza, en la provincia de Ravenna, de una familia modesta: sus padres José y Angela Castellani estaban al servicio de los condes de Ginnasi.\n\nNenni quedó huérfano de padre cuando tenía solo cinco años (1896).\n\nNenni fue periodista y posteriormente se convirtió en político. En 1911 fue encarcelado por organizar una manifestación en contra de la invasión italiana de Libia. En su estancia en la cárcel conoció a Benito Mussolini. En 1921 se afilió al Partido Socialista Italiano (PSI). En 1922 como redactor jefe del periódico Avanti!, atacó duramente a Mussolini que había llegado ese mismo año al poder. El periódico fue definitivamente clausurado en 1926 y Nenni se exilió a Francia, siendo elegido secretario general del PSI.\n\nEn 1936 participó en la guerra civil española como comisario político de la Brigada Garibaldi.[2]​\n\nDespués de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y de nuevo en Italia, ocupó distintos cargos gubernamentales, entre ellos los de vicepresidente del consejo de ministros (1945-1946) y Ministro de Asuntos Exteriores (1946-1947). Como consecuencia de la división del PSI, Nenni se quedó a la cabeza del bando más a la izquierda, aliándose con los comunistas, con los que rompió en 1957 debido a la invasión de Hungría.\n\nEn 1963, su entrada como vicepresidente de un gobierno de centro-izquierda originó la escisión del ala izquierda socialista que dio nacimiento al PSIUP. ​ Tras la reunificación en 1966, fue elegido presidente del partido y ocupó nuevamente el Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores en 1968. En 1969 dimitió de todos sus cargos al salir derrotada en el congreso del partido su moción favorable a la continuación de la alianza centro-izquierda.\n\nEn 1970, fue nombrado senador vitalicio. Años más tarde volvió a presidir el Partido Socialista y en 1978 se presentó con este partido como candidato para la presidencia de la República.Fondazione Pietro Nenni: An analysis of policies to empower labour in the digital workplace40°57'22.4\"N 14°09'49.6\"E: When you have eliminated the JavaScript, whatever remains must be an empty page."}

Rockefeller was the third son and fourth child of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. As a trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, he provided venture capital for Intel, Apple Computer and many other successful start-ups. Rockefeller was known for his involvement in wilderness preservation, ecology and the protection of wildlife. His crusade was the establishing of a conservation ethic, and he was declared America's leading conservationist by Lady Bird Johnson.\n\nRockefeller was born in New York City, as the fourth child of John Davison Rockefeller Jr. and Abigail Greene \"Abby\" Aldrich. His siblings were Abby, John III, Nelson, Winthrop, and David.\n\nHe graduated from Princeton University in 1932 and attended Harvard Law School for two years, until he decided he did not want to be a lawyer.\n\nOn August 22, 1934, in Woodstock, Vermont, Laurance married childhood friend Mary French, whose mother, Mary Montagu Billings French, was a friend of Laurance's mother. When brother Nelson attended Dartmouth College, he shared a room with Mary's brother. Mary was granddaughter of Frederick H. Billings, a president of Northern Pacific Railway.[1]\n\nLaurance and Mary had three daughters and a son. They are Laura Rockefeller Chasin, Marion Rockefeller Weber, Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky, and Laurance S. \"Larry\" Rockefeller Jr. He had eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nIn 1937, he inherited his grandfather's seat on the New York Stock Exchange. He served as founding trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for forty-two years, from its inception in 1940 to 1982; during this time he also served as president (1958–1968) and later its chairman (1968–1980) for twenty-two years, longer than any other leader in the Fund's history. He was also a founding trustee of the Rockefeller Family Fund from 1967 to 1977.\n\nHe was a leading figure in the pioneering field of venture capital,[citation needed] founding a joint partnership with all five brothers and their only sister, Babs, in 1946. In 1969 this became the successful Venrock Associates, which provided important early funding for Intel and Apple Computer, amongst many other start-up technology companies, including many other firms involved in healthcare. Over the years his investment interests spread into the fields of aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, thermionics, instrumentation and nuclear power. The family also had longstanding philanthropic ties, among them the Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller University, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nRockefeller's major interest was in aviation; after the War, he became friendly with Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, who had triumphed in many dogfights over Europe. Rockefeller had learned to fly, and found Rickenbacker's vivid accounts of an approaching boom in commercial air travel to be persuasive. Within a decade after Rockefeller's considerable investment, Eastern Airlines had become the most profitable airline to emerge after World War II. He became its largest shareholder.[citation needed] He also funded the pivotal post-WWII military contractor McDonnell Aircraft Corp.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1966, Rockefeller was considered by President Lyndon B. Johnson for the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, then a newly-formed agency. The position instead went to Robert C. Weaver, the first African American Cabinet member in American history.[2]\n\nRockefeller was a longtime friend and associate of DeWitt Wallace, who with his wife in 1922 co-founded Reader's Digest. Wallace, who was a major funder of the family's Colonial Williamsburg, appointed Laurance as an outside director in the company.[3] He wanted to ensure that it preserved its patriotic mission of informing and educating the public, along with support for national parks, one of Rockefeller's primary interests.\n\nThrough his resort management company, Rockresorts, Inc., Rockefeller opened environmentally focused hotels at Caneel Bay on Saint John, United States Virgin Islands (1956; a favorite resort today for celebrities), some property of which was later turned over to the Virgin Islands National Park; in Puerto Rico, on Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands, and Hawaii, contributing to the movement now known as eco-tourism. The last of these, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel, was established in 1965 on the Kohala Coast of the island of Hawaii. Its most noted general manager was Adi Kohler, who later wrote the story of the construction of the famous hotel in his book \"Mr. Mauna Kea\" published by McKenna Publishing Group. While sailing past Virgin Gorda, Rockefeller spotted an idyllic half-mile crescent bay with what he dubbed \"wilderness beach\". In 1958 planning and land acquisition began for what would become Little Dix Bay. The resort opened in 1964 and on January 18, 2014, Little Dix Bay celebrated its 50th anniversary. In 1993, the resort became part of Rosewood Hotels & Resorts but remains true to Rockefeller's vision of natural harmony and balance while offering an escape from the ordinary. Elsewhere in the US Virgin Islands Rockresorts developed the Carambola Resort on St. Croix on an incredible stretch of beach that was also famous for being the setting for the closing scene of the movie Trading Places.\n\nRockefeller funded the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center at a critical juncture of its early development. He also funded William Irwin Thompson's Lindisfarne Association, a think tank and retreat. He had a major involvement in the New York Zoological Society, along with support from other family members and philanthropies; he was a long-time trustee (1935–1986), president (1968–1971) and chairman (1971–1985).\n\nIn 1983, Laurance Rockefeller donated the primary funds to create The Mirror Theater Ltd, a New York-based theater company founded by Sabra Jones.[4] The Mirror Theater Ltd is known for producing the 1983 Broadway play Alice in Wonderland at the Virginia Theatre and for the many plays performed by its Mirror Repertory Company.\n\nRockefeller also funded[5] research of the PEAR lab, dealing with consciousness-based physical phenomena.\n\nHe also had an interest, gained via his mother Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, in Buddhism and Asian cultural affairs. He funded the research of Harvard Medical School Professor Dr. John E. Mack, author of Passport to the Cosmos. He also was reported to have supported the work of Dr. Steven M. Greer of the Disclosure Project.[6] Rockefeller was also a patron to Roger A. Weir, specifically in relation to Weir's research on Jesus and Mary Magdalene.[7]\n\nRockefeller opposed the harsh punishments of the War on Drugs, including the \"Rockefeller Drug Laws\" that his older brother, Nelson, championed. He wrote to the New York Times in June 2002, \"Overly harsh laws and punishments have reduced faith in government, which is essential to the functioning of a democracy.\"[8]\n\nIn later life, Rockefeller became interested in UFOs. In 1993, along with his niece, Anne Bartley, the stepdaughter of Winthrop Rockefeller and the then-president of the Rockefeller Family Fund, he established the UFO Disclosure Initiative to the Clinton White House. They asked for all UFO information held by the government, including from the CIA and the US Air Force, to be declassified and released to the public. The first and most important test case where declassification had to apply, according to Rockefeller, was the Roswell UFO incident. In September 1994, the Air Force categorically denied the incident was UFO-related. Rockefeller briefed Clinton on the results of his initiative in 1995. Clinton did produce an Executive Order in late 1994 to declassify numerous documents in the National Archives, but this did not specifically refer to UFO-related files.[9]\n\nHe was noted for his involvement in conservation (Lady Bird Johnson in 1967 labeled him \"America's leading conservationist\") and the protection of wildlife and was chairman of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission. He was also a recipient of the Lady Bird Johnson Conservation Award. He served on dozens of federal, state and local commissions and advised every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower on issues involving recreation, wilderness preservation and ecology. He founded the American Conservation Association and supported many other environmental groups.\n\nHe funded the expansion of Grand Teton National Park and was instrumental in establishing and enlarging national parks in Wyoming, California, the Virgin Islands, Vermont, Maine and Hawaii. In his home state, New York, he expended further cash and influence to help establish parklands and urban open spaces. There, as an active member of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, he helped create a chain of parks that blocked the advance of urban sprawl.\n\nIn September 1991, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for contributions to conservation and historic preservation. Awarded by President George H. W. Bush, it was the first time in the Medal's history (since 1777) that it had been awarded for outdoor issues, effectively naming Rockefeller as \"Mr Conservation\", who more than any other American had put this issue on the public agenda. Rockefeller said at the award presentation that nothing was more important to him than \"the creation of a conservation ethic in America\".[11]\n\nIn 1992 Rockefeller and his wife Mary donated their Woodstock, Vermont, summer home and farm to the National Park Service, creating a national park dedicated to the history of conservation, now called the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. In 2001, Rockefeller transferred ownership of his landmark 1106-acre (4.5 km2) JY Ranch to the Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. It was accepted by Vice President Dick Cheney on behalf of the Federal government (see External Links below).\n• The Conservation Foundation – Founding Member and Trustee, board of directors\n\nMary Rockefeller died in 1997, at the age of 86. Following his wife Mary's death, Rockefeller returned to New York. He died in his sleep of natural cause by pulmonary fibrosis on July 11, 2004, at the age of 94. Laurance Rockefeller was survived by his four children. He was interred next to his wife at the Rockefeller Family Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow.\n• From the Captain to the Colonel: An Informal History of Eastern Airlines, Robert J. Serling, New York: Dial Press, 1980.\n• The Rockefeller Archive Center Biographical details from the family archives.Laurance S. Rockefeller, 1910-2004: Laurance Spelman Rockefeller was born on May 26, 1910, in New York City, the fourth of the six children of Abby Aldrich and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. He attended the Lincoln School of Teachers College of Columbia University in New York before entering Princeton University in 1928. He graduated in 1932 with a B.A. degree in philosophy and went on to two years of graduate study at Harvard Law School.\n\nOn August 15, 1934, Laurance married Mary French in the Congregational Church in Woodstock, Vermont. Together they raised three daughters and a son. Laurance and Mary maintained homes in Manhattan and Pocantico Hills, New York; Jackson Hole, Wyoming; and Woodstock, Vermont.\n\nDuring World War II, Laurance served in the U.S. Navy (1942-1945) in the Bureau of Aeronautics, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.\n\nThroughout his life, Laurance pursued a number of successful careers. He was a pioneer in the field of venture capital. He was an influential figure for three decades in the American conservation movement. He led the development of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, one of the world’s foremost cancer care and research facilities, and served as both a benefactor and advisor to major educational institutions. Laurance also combined his personal vision for conservation, recreation, and the spiritual needs of individuals to develop internationally acclaimed environmentally oriented resorts.\n\nIn 1935, he began working in the Family Office in Rockefeller Center. His first duties were to develop his knowledge of Rockefeller philanthropic activities, conservation projects, and business interests. Simultaneously, he developed his own interests, blending business acumen with the talents of a “gadgeteer,” as he once referred to himself.\n\nLaurance became well known as an investor of risk capital in young enterprises based primarily in scientific and technological development. Over the years his investment interests included the fields of aviation, aerospace, electronics, high temperature physics, composite materials, optics, lasers, data processing, thermionics, instrumentation, and nuclear power. Beginning in August 1969, his venture capital investments in these areas were made through Venrock, a venture capital group formed by members of the Rockefeller family. He also developed outstanding environmentally oriented resort hotels in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, and Vermont, serving as the chair of Rockresorts, Inc., a resort management company that he founded.\n\nConservation of the environment and recreational development constituted much of Laurance’s philanthropy and public service. His introduction to public service came in 1939, when Governor Herbert Lehman of New York appointed him to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC). He later served as president of the PIPC from 1970 to 1977 and continued as a commissioner until his resignation in December 1978.\n\nWhile on a family vacation in 1926, Laurance had visited the region of Wyoming that includes Grand Teton National Park. Captivated by the area, his father subsequently purchased a substantial amount of land around Jackson Hole to safeguard it and the view of the Grand Teton Mountains. In 1949, as president of Jackson Hole Preserve, Inc., Laurance made a gift to the federal government on behalf of his father of the valley land, which was included in Grand Teton National Park.\n\nLaurance established the American Conservation Association, Inc., in 1958 as a philanthropy to function as a conservation service agency, assisting the work of other agencies—both private and governmental—and initiating projects of its own. It was part of the movement that helped to focus public attention on the quality of the American environment.\n\nAlso in 1958, President Dwight Eisenhower appointed him chair of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission, which charted ways to meet the nation’s outdoor recreation needs through the end of the century. He was a special emissary for President Lyndon Johnson in the effort that led to the creation of the Redwood National Park in California, and he served as chair of President Richard Nixon’s Citizens’ Advisory Committee on Environmental Quality, successor to a similar group that he headed under President Johnson. He played a pivotal role in the creation and development of several national parks including Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming; Virgin Islands National Park on the island of St. John; and Marsh, Billings, Rockefeller National Historical Park in Vermont.\n\nLaurance served as a leader of several important nonprofit and philanthropic organizations. He was president and later chair of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (1958-1980) and was a trustee of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (1960-1982). His first association with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center was in 1947; he also served as chair (1960-1982), overseeing an expansion and modernization of its operations. He was a longtime trustee of the New York Zoological Society (1935-1986) and served as its president (1969-1971) and chair (1971-1985).\n\nLaurance received many honors for his efforts on behalf of the environment and cancer research and treatment. Among them are the Alfred P. Sloan, Jr. Memorial Award from the American Cancer Society (1969), the Medal of Freedom (1969), the Congressional Gold Medal (1991), and the Lady Bird Johnson Conservation Award for Lifetime Achievement (1997). In 2003, he became the first person to be made an honorary citizen of the British Virgin Islands in recognition of his many contributions to the area.\n\nLaurance Rockefeller died on July 11, 2004, at his home on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.Laurance Rockefeller (U.S. National Park Service): Laurance Spelman Rockefeller (1910 – 2004) married Mary French (1910 –1997), the granddaughter of Frederick Billings, and came to love the farm and forest as though he'd always lived in Woodstock. One of the foremost conservationists and philanthropists of the twentieth century, he combined the ecological philosophy of George Perkins Marsh with the practical conservationist approach of Frederick Billings.\n\nLaurance Rockefeller was the fourth child of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Greene Aldrich. Laurance's grandfather, John D. Rockefeller Sr., was the head of the Standard Oil Company. Laurance's father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., was an enthusiastic supporter of park-building and historic preservation, and the Great Smoky Mountains, Shenandoah, Grand Teton, Acadia, and Redwood National Parks are testimony to his generosity.\n\nFrom a young age, Laurance demonstrated a fascination with the natural world. He discovered the wonders of the West on trips to the Grand Canyon, the Tetons, Yellowstone and Yosemite. He became a trustee of the New York Zoological Society at the age of twenty-five, and was appointed to the Palisades Interstate Park Commission a few years later.\n\nIn 1940, Laurance's father, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., established the Jackson Hole Preserve to promote conservation and to protect family land holdings in the Tetons of Wyoming. Laurance became the first president of the Jackson Hole Preserve. After he returned from World War II, he began to build upon his father's vision of expanding the national park system by partnering conservation of natural spaces with the provision of tourist accommodation and facilities so that more Americans could experience their country's scenic wonders.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the late 1960s, Laurance served as a “citizen advisor” on matters of conservation, recreation, and the environment, working as a non-elected but prominent and influential spokesman for five presidents, from Eisenhower to Ford, to make conservation a higher priority for government officials and the public at large. In 1958, Laurance was named chairman of the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (ORRRC). Under his leadership, the Commission devised a visionary management plan for open space and public recreation. Throughout his career as a conservationist, Laurance articulated a comprehensive approach to land stewardship that combined preservation with public access. In 1991, President George H. W. Bush presented him with the Congressional Gold Medal \"in recognition of his leadership on behalf of natural resource conservation and historic preservation.\" During the Johnson Administration, Laurance chaired the White House Conference on Natural Beauty, a group that hoped to protect and promote natural beauty not only in wilderness areas but in cities and along highways. Subsequently, while serving with Lady Bird Johnson on the Committee for a More Beautiful Capital, Laurance oversaw improvements to Washington, D.C. parks, gardens, playgrounds, and memorial statues.\n\nLaurance Rockefeller purchased and developed a resort on St. John, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and also donated 5000 acres of the island to the National Park Service, which eventually became Virgin Islands National Park. He created seven complexes of resort developments, eventually managed together as Rockresorts Inc, established in 1966. These resorts were not linked to national park land; rather, they were private business ventures intended to both generate long-term profits and benefit the economy of the local area.\n\nLaurance and Mary French Rockefeller were married in 1934, and together had four children. Laurance described their marriage as a “partnership,” one of “parallel careers,” and many of their interests and commitments mirrored the other’s. Both were heavily involved in one another's business and philanthropic endeavors, especially those involving the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and causes relating to natural and historic resources.\n\nIn Woodstock, Vermont, the Rockefellers saw a community with many natural resources and a remarkable cultural history. After Mary French Rockefeller's mother, Mary Billings French, died in 1951, she and Laurance inherited the family mansion, remodeled it, and modernized the Billings Farm across the street. In 1969, the Rockefellers purchased and revitalized the Wodstock Inn. In June 1983, the Rockefellers formally opened the Billings Farm & Museum “to preserve the historic Billings Farm as well as the character and heritage of rural Vermont”. Today, the Billings Farm & Museum is an educational non-profit dedicated to connecting people to the land through experiences on a working Vermont dairy farm.\n\nIn 1992, the couple donated the residential property, along with 555 acres of Mount Tom forestland, to the National Park Service. The couple planned to continue to live in the historic mansion on the property until 1998, when the National Park was slated to open for public visitation. After Mary Rockefeller’s death in 1997, Laurance participated in the opening ceremony of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park on June 5, 1998. Laurance died in 2004, at the age of ninety-four. Today, one of the most significant roles of Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park is to serve as a tribute to the unique people who resided here and their vision for a world in which man lives in cooperation and harmony with nature.Laurance Rockefeller - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Laurance Spelman Rockefeller (Nueva York, 26 de mayo de 1910 - Nueva York, 1 de julio de 2004) fue un inversionista de riesgo, financista, filántropo, conservacionista y miembro de la tercera generación de la familia Rockefeller. Fue el cuarto hijo de John D. Rockefeller Jr. y hermano de John D. III, Nelson, Winthrop y David.\n\nRockefeller nació en Nueva York y se graduó en la Universidad de Princeton en 1932. Luego asistió a la Escuela de leyes de Harvard por dos años hasta llegar a la conclusión que no sería un abogado.\n\nContrajo matrimonio con Mary French en 1934. La amistad entre la madre francesa de Mary, Mary Montague French y la madre de Laurence permitieron una infancia compartida. Cuando Nelson Rockefeller asistió al Dartmouth College, compartió una habitación con el hermano de Mary. Mary era nieta de Frederick H. Billings, presidente del Northern Pacific Railway.\n\nLaurence y Mary tuvieron tres hijos: Laura R. Chasin, Marion R. Weber, Dr. Lucy R. Waletzky, y Larry Rockefeller.En 2004 tenían ocho nietos y doce bisnietos. Mary French falleció en 1997.\n\nEn 1937 heredó el puesto de su abuelo en la Bolsa de Nueva York. Se desempeñó como administrador de la Fundación hermanos Rockefeller durante cuarenta y dos años, desde su creación en 1940 hasta 1982: durante ese tiempo actuó también como presidente (1958-1968). También actuó como administrador del Fondo Familia Rockefeller.\n\nFue una figura de liderazgo en el campo pionero de los capitales de riesgo, que inició como una asociación con sus cinco hermanos y única hermana, Babs, en 1946. En 1969 la firma se convirtió en Venrock (contracción de venture y Rockefeller), que proveyó importantes inversiones iniciales para Intel y Apple Computer, entre otras empresas de naciente tecnología en aquel momento, incluyendo otras involucradas en el campo de la salud. Con los años sus inversiones abarcaron también el campo del aeroespacio, electrónica, física de alta temperatura, materiales compuestos, óptica, láser, procesamiento de datos, y energía atómica.\n\nVenrock es una compañía limitada de patrocinio de inversiones financiada por miembros de la familia Rockefeller y un grupo de instituciones con quien la familia ha mantenido una larga relación filantrópica, entre ellas el Museo de Arte Moderno, la Universidad Rockefeller y el Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nEl mayor interés de Laurance fue sin duda la aviación: luego de la guerra se hizo amigo del capitán Eddie Rickenbacker, triunfador de varias batallas aéreas sobre Europa.Rockefeller era autodidacta en la aviación y encontró que la experiencia de Rickenbacker daría la posibilidad de acercarse a un éxito comercial en aviación. Luego de una década de considerable inversión, Eastern Airlines se convirtió en una de las aerolíneas más rentables surgidas luego de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. También fundó la compañía contratista de posguerra más importante en relación con la aviación y la defensa, McDonnell Aircraft.\n\nLaurance fue durante largo tiempo amigo y asociado de DeWitt Wallace, el cofundador de Reader's Digest en 1922, quien designó a Rockefeller como uno de los directores externos de la empresa, con el objetivo de preservar «la patriótica misión de educar e informar al público», sumado a su ferviente apoyo de los parques nacionales, otro de los intereses de Rockefeller.[1]​\n• None Esta obra contiene una traducción derivada de « Laurance Rockefeller » de Wikipedia en inglés, publicada por sus editores bajo la Licencia de documentación libre de GNU y la Licencia Creative Commons Atribución-CompartirIgual 4.0 Internacional\n• Dick Cheney's remarks in 2001 on the transfer by Laurance of his JY Ranch to the Federal Government Archivado el 15 de enero de 2009 en Wayback Machine.Celebrating the Legacy of Laurance Rockefeller: 20 Years After His Passing (U.S. National Park Service): Laurance Rockefeller, Mary Rockefeller, and Govenor Dean Daviss at the opening ceremony of the Woodstock Inn in 1969 Laurance held a deep affection for Woodstock, not only as his wife, Mary French Rockefeller's beloved home but as a community that shaped their lives. Despite the high expectations associated with the Rockefeller name, Laurance's quiet demeanor surprised many who encountered him, transcending the typical perceptions of wealth and privilege. His intellectual curiosity and gentle nature helped forge partnerships across diverse groups, underlining his belief that true progress comes from shared interests. Laurance understood that synergy could transform unique ideas into collective action.\n\nFor Laurance, this view represented unity and collaboration. He and Mary acquired 400 acres of Blake Hill, placing a scenic easement on 249 acres to protect the land's rural character. This preservation effort invited local citizens to engage in conservation as stakeholders with a shared vision. Laurance exemplified collaborative leadership by fostering partnerships between the Woodstock Inn and Resort, Billings Farm and Museum, and the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. This synergy promoted economic opportunities while protecting the community's historical and cultural heritage. Laurance actively engaged in historic preservation, advocating for initiatives such as burying power lines to maintain Woodstock's charming character, which had earned the acclaim of being the \"Prettiest Small Town in America.\" The development of the Farm, Park, and Woodstock Inn established a robust economic foundation and fostered stewardship alliances within the community. In 1967, the Billings Mansion received national significance, becoming a National Historic Landmark under the guidance of then-First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. This recognition set the stage for the creation of Vermont's first National Park in 1992.\n\nPorcelain bunnies from Laurance Rockefeller's childhood, now in the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller mansion library Born on May 26, 1910, as the fourth son of John D. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Laurance was raised in an environment where frugality, generosity, humility, and hard work were paramount. Alongside his siblings, he understood that they would eventually inherit their father's great wealth. As young children, they were taught the importance of financial management. They were required to create acceptable projects to earn allowances, instilling skills in managing accounts and incorporating philanthropy as a vital aspect of their financial responsibilities. Throughout the mansion, porcelain “bunnies” serve as reminders of a specific project Laurance undertook with one of his siblings. They learned to never flaunt the wealth they would inherit, reinforcing the values of humility and responsibility. Numerous projects and interests were designed to cultivate independence and self-reliance, guiding them on their paths to adulthood.\n\nA graduate of Princeton University with a degree in Philosophy, Laurance developed a deep appreciation for nature and the human spirit. His commitment to balance informed his decision-making, symbolized by the scales he collected. He served as a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy (1942-1945) during WWII, gaining practical experience while continuing to cultivate a passion for aviation and technology. Laurance's philanthropic endeavors extended beyond environmental causes; he was a pivotal investor in early technology firms, including Apple and Intel, and a benefactor to cancer research through the Sloan Kettering Cancer Institute.\n\n \n\n Balance was a major factor in Laurance's decision-making, symbolized by the scales he collected. He believed that all factors must be weighed equally when making important choices, and that even something as light as a feather could offset the scale of a decision. A significant gift from Mary, a piece of Steuben Crystal called \"Unity through Opposites,\" reflects Laurance's values in working with various groups and interests. This piece not only embodies his philosophy of balance but also serves as a physical reminder of his commitment to understanding diverse perspectives.\n\nThe Rockefeller and Billings families shared social ties early on. Laurance’s mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, served on the board of directors of the YWCA, where she met Mary French’s mother. Mary French was the granddaughter of Frederick and Julia Billings, intertwining their family histories. Over the years, the families continued to cultivate connections. Notably, Nelson R. Rockefeller attended Dartmouth, where his roommate was Mary’s brother, John French. As Laurance studied law at Harvard, Mary pursued her studies at Radcliffe. Their courtship blossomed, culminating in their marriage in Woodstock in 1934, where they welcomed four children—three daughters and a son.\n\nLaurance [second from right] at Glacier National Park with group including John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Nelson Rockefeller. Text reads: \"Ready to start on the day's ride at Shafers Meadows near Glacier National Park, Montana. 1924\" Laurance was profoundly influenced by his family’s travels to national parks, particularly by his father’s work. Some of his early conservation responsibilities included leading organizations such as the Palisades Park Commission and the Jackson Hole Preserve. He also collaborated with Lady Bird Johnson, serving as chair of her Beautify America campaign. In the late 1950s, President Eisenhower appointed Laurance to chair the Outdoor Resources Recreation Review Commission (ORRRC). This panel, composed of experts from both the public and private sectors, was tasked with studying outdoor recreation. The ORRRC had a profound impact on outdoor recreation and environmental policy in the decades following its establishment. Additionally, Laurance created and expanded several National Parks, including Virgin Islands National Park and Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. He also honored his father’s wishes by donating the Laurance Spellman Rockefeller Preserve, formerly the JY Ranch, a 1,100-acre parcel of land within the Grand Tetons, to the National Park Service in 2001.\n\nLaurance and Mary Rockefeller at the opening of Billings Farm & Museum, 1983 Laurance Rockefeller was, in many regards, a larger-than-life figure due to his name, yet he was an unpretentious man. He worked collaboratively with others and has significantly impacted our lives, using his good name for the benefit of many. Laurance felt a profound obligation to serve the American public and his local community. Laurance was an unassuming individual who cared deeply. Through our actions, we can carry forth his legacy by actively participating in our communities and taking what matters most to us into the future."}

historian who participated in and chronicled the Fourth Crusade. He is considered one of the most important historians of the time period,[2] best known for writing the eyewitness account De la Conquête de Constantinople (On the Conquest of Constantinople), about the battle for Constantinople between the Christians of the West and the Christians of the East on 13 April 1204. The Conquest is the earliest French historical prose narrative that has survived to modern times. Ηis full title was: \"Geoffroi of Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne and of Romania\".\n\nA layman and a soldier,[3] Geoffroi was appointed Marshal of Champagne from 1185 and joined the Crusade in 1199 during a tournament held by Count Thibaud III of Champagne. Thibaud named him one of the ambassadors to Venice to procure ships for the voyage, and he helped to elect Boniface of Montferrat as the new leader of the Crusade when Thibaud died.\n\nAlthough Geoffroi does not say so specifically in his own account, he probably supported the diversion of the Crusade first to Zara and then to Constantinople. While at Constantinople he also served as an ambassador to Isaac II Angelus, and was in the embassy that demanded that Isaac appoint Alexius IV co-emperor.\n\nAfter the conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 he served as a military leader, and led the retreat from the Battle of Adrianople in 1205 after Baldwin I was captured by the forces of the Second Bulgarian Empire. In recognition of his services, Boniface of Montferrat gave to Geoffroi the city of Messinopolis in Thrace. After the Crusade, he was named Marshal of the Latin Empire.\n\nIn 1207, Geoffroi began to write his chronicle of the Crusade, On the Conquest of Constantinople. It was in French rather than Latin, making it one of the earliest works of French prose. Villehardouin's account is generally read alongside that of Robert of Clari, a French knight of low station, Niketas Choniates, a high-ranking Byzantine official and historian who gives an eyewitness account, and Gunther of Pairis, a Cistercian monk who tells the story from the perspective of Abbot Martin who accompanied the Crusaders.\n\nVillehardouin's nephew Geoffroi I of Villehardouin went on to become Prince of Achaea in Morea (the medieval name for the Peloponnesus) in 1209. Villehardouin himself seems to have died shortly afterwards. His son Erard had taken the title of seigneur de Villehardouin in 1213. There is evidence of his children raising memorials for him in 1218, suggesting he died around this time.\n• This article focuses on a critical review of De la Conquête de Constantinople.\n• Chronicles of the Crusades (Villehardouin and Jean de Joinville), translated by Margaret R.

Il participe à la prise de Constantinople (1204) pendant la quatrième croisade et à la formation de l’Empire latin d’Orient avec Baudouin de Hainaut. Maréchal de Champagne puis de Romanie (c'est-à-dire de l'Empire latin), il rédige après les événements une des premières chroniques en ancien français, La Conquête de Constantinople.\n\nIl est un fils cadet de Vilain, seigneur de Villehardouin, dans le comté de Champagne et dans l'actuel département de l'Aube. Il naît à une date inconnue, vers 1150[3].\n\nIl s'élève au poste de maréchal de Champagne, à partir de 1185[4], et entre au conseil de la régente Marie de France[1]. Il accompagne son suzerain Henri de Champagne à la troisième croisade au cours de laquelle il est capturé en pendant le siège de Saint-Jean-d'Acre, mais il réapparaît en Champagne à partir de 1194[1]. Ses qualités personnelles ainsi que ses fonctions de maréchal l'amènent à participer à beaucoup d'affaires administratives et politiques : il remplit à plusieurs reprises l'office de médiateur et d'arbitre, réglant entre autres, de compagnie avec l'archevêque de Sens, le différend qui oppose en 1198 le comte Thibaud, son seigneur, et le chapitre de la cathédrale de Troyes[5]. En , lorsque le comte de Champagne rend hommage au roi de France, Geoffroi figure parmi les garants[6].\n\nEn , il se croise à l'appel de Foulques de Neuilly lors du tournoi d'Écry[7]. En , quelques mois avant la mort de son suzerain, il est chargé par Thibaut III de Champagne de préparer et négocier le transport des croisés vers l'Égypte auprès de la république de Venise[8]. Dans la séance solennelle de l'assemblée du peuple vénitien, c'est lui qui prend la parole pour exposer les intentions des croisés[8], ainsi qu'il le raconte dans sa chronique[9]. Après avoir proposé le nom de Boniface de Montferrat pour commander l'expédition, il quitte Venise le [10].\n\nCette croisade, dont l'objectif initial est de délivrer Jérusalem, aboutit à la prise de Constantinople et à la fondation de l'Empire latin d'Orient. Tout au long de la croisade, Villehardouin joue un rôle de premier plan. Il participe à la prise de la ville le et reçoit du nouvel empereur Baudouin de Constantinople le titre de maréchal de Romanie[11] (c'est-à-dire de l'Empire latin d'Orient). Après la défaite d'Andrinople en 1205, au cours de laquelle Baudouin est fait prisonnier, il montre ses talents de stratège en sauvant l'armée croisée[12]. En 1207, Boniface de Montferrat, roi de Thessalonique, lui donne le fief de Messinople[11]. Il se distingue encore par son courage et sa sagesse lors de l'expédition de l'empereur Henri contre les Bulgares, de mai à [12], et s'illustre à la bataille de Philippopoli[11].\n\nSon fils Érard ayant pris, en 1213, le titre de seigneur de Villehardouin, certains ont pensé que Geoffroi serait mort cette année-là dans son fief de Messinople, en Thrace[13] ; cependant le délai très court entre la dernière attestation de Geoffroi vivant (il est témoin d'un acte daté du , à Halmyros en Thessalie), et le premier acte connu dans lequel Érard prend le titre de seigneur de Villehardouin ( ), moins de deux mois au maximum, écarte cette hypothèse pour Jean Longnon, compte tenu du temps nécessaire à la transmission de cette nouvelle entre la Grèce et la Champagne. L'existence de cinq fondations d'anniversaire groupées au cours de l'année 1218 pourrait quant à elle indiquer que sa mort était alors récente, mais sans certitude, et il ne semble donc pas possible de préciser davantage[2].\n\nGeoffroi de Villehardouin eut un neveu et un petit-neveu portant son prénom, soit respectivement Geoffroi de Villehardouin et Geoffroi de Villehardouin, princes d'Achaïe.\n\nDe 1207 à 1213 il rédige en ancien français une histoire de la quatrième croisade, intitulée De la Conquête de Constantinople, décrivant les événements survenus entre 1198 et 1207, dans un style remarquable. Néanmoins, sa bonne foi ou sa perspicacité ont été mises en doute à partir du siècle par certains historiens modernes qui expliquent le détournement de la croisade de son but initial par l'existence d'un complot prémédité (généralement vénitien ou germanique) que Villehardouin n'aurait pas souhaité révéler ou qu'il n'aurait pas décelé. D'autres auteurs, rejetant la théorie d'un complot, ne remettent pas en doute sa sincérité.\n\nLa chronique de Villehardouin est considérée comme la meilleure illustration de l'esprit de la chevalerie de l'époque, dans sa dimension virile et pragmatique, qui donnera l'impulsion des croisades et conduira des chevaliers errants à établir des principautés et des royaumes dans l'ensemble de l'Europe et du Proche-Orient[14]. Son œuvre forme un contraste intéressant avec la chronique de l'historien byzantin Nicétas Choniatès, qui relate la prise de Constantinople du point de vue des vaincus[14].\n• Histoire de Geoffroy de Villehardouyn, Mareschal de Champagne & de Romenie; de la conqueste de Constantinople par les Barons François associez aux Venitiens, l'an 1204, Abel L'Angelier, 1585.

He was the first serious writer of an original prose history in Old French.\n\nAlthough he was only one of the lesser nobility, Villehardouin was from the start accepted as one of the leaders of the Fourth Crusade. In 1205 his consummate generalship saved the Frankish army from destruction at the hands of the Bulgars outside Adrianople (modern Edirne, Turkey) and led them without loss through hostile country to safety in Constantinople.\n\nVillehardouin’s work, usually known as the Conquête de Constantinople (Conquest of Constantinople), initiated the great series of histories that so distinguishes medieval French literature. His achievement is remarkable because neither in style nor form did he have any models on which to base his work; his Latin predecessors were probably unknown to him firsthand. He probably started writing his chronicle about 1209. In it, he describes the “crusade,” a war in which French knights and their Venetian allies invaded the Byzantine Empire and captured its capital Constantinople (1204). It was after the city’s fall that Villehardouin distinguished himself in the conflict with the Bulgars.Geoffrey I of Villehardouin - Wikipedia: Geoffrey I of Villehardouin (French: Geoffroi Ier de Villehardouin) (c. 1169 – c. 1229) was a French knight from the County of Champagne who joined the Fourth Crusade.[1][2][3][4] He participated in the conquest of the Peloponnese and became the second prince of Achaea (1209/1210–c. 1229).[2]\n\nUnder his reign, the Principality of Achaea became the direct vassal of the Latin Empire of Constantinople.[5] He extended the borders of his principality.[6]\n\nGeoffrey was the eldest son of Céline of Briel and John of Villehardouin.[2] He married one Elisabeth, who may be Elisabeth of Chappes,[7] a scion of a fellow crusader family, an identification rejected by Longnon.[8]\n\nWilliam of Champlitte was prince of Achaea (1205–1209) under the suzerainty of the king of Thessalonica.[9][10] Geoffrey received Kalamata and Messenia as a fief from the new prince.[10]\n\nIn 1208 William I of Achaea sought to claim an inheritance his brother had left to him.[5][11] However, both the first prince of Achaea and his nephew died.[12]\n\nThe Chronicle of the Morea narrates that Geoffrey only became prince of Achaea some time later.[13]\n\nNext the papal legate Cardinal Giovanni Colonna in 1218 excommunicated Geoffrey I.[14] Upon the request of the local high clergy, it was confirmed during 1219.[15]\n\nGeoffrey died sometime between 1228 and 1230.[4] He was buried in the Church of St James in Andravida.\n• Evergates, Theodore (2007).

Located at a distance of 17,090 light-years (5,240 parsecs), it is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years.[10] It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars, with a total mass of 4 million solar masses,[11] making it the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way.\n\nOmega Centauri is very different from most other galactic globular clusters to the extent that it is thought to have originated as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.[12]\n\nAround 150 AD, Greco-Roman writer and astronomer Ptolemy catalogued this object in his Almagest as a star on the centaur's back, \"Quae est in principio scapulae\". German cartographer Johann Bayer used Ptolemy's data to designate this object \"Omega Centauri\" with his 1603 publication of Uranometria.[13] Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley observed this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1716, it was published by Halley among his list of six \"luminous spots or patches\" in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[14][15]\n\nSwiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux included Omega Centauri in his 1746 list of 21 nebulae,[15][16] as did French astronomer Lacaille in 1755, whence the catalogue number is designated L I.5.[17] It was first recognized as a globular cluster by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop in 1826, who described it as a \"beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre\".[18][19]\n\nAt a distance of about 17,000 light-years (5,200 parsecs) from Earth, Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye—and appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area.[20] It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses,[6] the most massive-known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II in the Andromeda Galaxy is brighter and more massive.[21] Orbiting through the Milky Way, Omega Centauri contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old.[22]\n\nThe stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light-year away from each other.[22] The internal dynamics have been analyzed using measurements of the radial velocities of 469 stars.[23] The members of this cluster are orbiting the center of mass with a peak velocity dispersion of 7.9 km s−1. The mass distribution inferred from the kinematics is slightly more extended than, though not strongly inconsistent with, the luminosity distribution.[citation needed]\n\nA 2008 study presented evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of Omega Centauri, based on observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pachón in Chile.[24][25] Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys showed that stars are bunching up near the center of Omega Centauri, as evidenced by the gradual increase in starlight near the center. Using instruments at the Gemini Observatory to measure the speed of stars swirling in the cluster's core, E. Noyola and colleagues found that stars closer to the core are moving faster than stars farther away. This measurement was interpreted to mean that unseen matter at the core is interacting gravitationally with nearby stars. By comparing these results with standard models, the astronomers concluded that the most likely cause was the gravitational pull of a dense, massive object such as a black hole. They calculated the object's mass at 40,000 solar masses.[24]\n\nMore recent work has challenged conclusions that there is a black hole in the cluster's core, in particular disputing the proposed location of the cluster center.[26][27] Calculations using a revised location for the center found that the velocity of core stars does not vary with distance, as would be expected if an intermediate-mass black hole were present. The same studies also found that starlight does not increase toward the center but instead remains relatively constant. The authors noted that their results do not entirely rule out the black hole proposed by Noyola and colleagues, but they do not confirm it, and they limit its maximum mass to 12,000 solar masses.\n\nA study from July 10, 2024 has examined seven fast-moving stars from the center of Omega Centauri and found that their speeds were consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole of at least 8,200 solar masses.[28]\n\nIt has been speculated that Omega Centauri is the core of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the Milky Way.[29] Indeed, Kapteyn's Star, which is currently only 13 light-years away from Earth, is thought to originate from Omega Centauri.[30] Omega Centauri's chemistry and motion in the Milky Way are also consistent with this picture.[20] Like Mayall II, Omega Centauri has a range of metallicities and stellar ages that suggests that it did not all form at once (as globular clusters are thought to form) and may in fact be the remainder of the core of a smaller galaxy long since incorporated into the Milky Way.[31]\n\nThe novel Singularity (2012), by Ian Douglas, presents as fact that Omega Centauri and Kapteyn's Star originate from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, and this origin is central to the novel's plot. A number of scientific aspects of Omega Centauri are discussed as the story progresses, including the likely radiation environment inside the cluster and what the sky might look like from inside the cluster.[32]\n\nThe character Atlan has adventures in Omega Centauri in cycle 7 of the Atlan series, a spinoff of the German science fiction series Perry Rhodan.

Archived 2006-05-07 at the Wayback MachineMeet Omega Centauri, a giant star cluster: Omega Centauri, the largest known globular star cluster of the Milky Way, contains about 10 million stars. This behemoth, also known as NGC 5139, has a diameter of about 150 light-years. And, it’s 10 times more massive than a typical globular cluster. However, despite all these stars, scientists released a study in 2018 that said Omega Centauri probably is not home to life.\n\nJoin us in making sure everyone has access to the wonders of astronomy. Donate now!\n\nStars pack so tightly inside Omega Centauri that the average distance between stars in the cluster’s core is 0.1 light-years. That’s much closer than the sun’s nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, at 4.25 light-years. So scientists concluded that stars in Omega Centauri would gravitationally interact with each other too frequently to harbor stable habitable planets.\n\nIt’s not only Omega Centauri’s great size that sets it apart from other globular star clusters. Most globular clusters generally have stars of similar age and composition. However, studies of Omega Centauri reveal that it has different stellar populations that formed at varying periods of time. In fact, it may be that Omega Centauri is something other than a globular cluster. It might be a remnant core of a small galaxy absorbed by our Milky Way galaxy in the distant past!\n\nThe difference between an open and a globular star cluster\n\nThe symmetrical, round appearance of Omega Centauri distinguishes it from star clusters such as the Pleiades and Hyades, which are open star clusters.\n\nAn open star cluster is a loose gathering of dozens to hundreds of young stars that formed together within the disk of the Milky Way galaxy. Open clusters are weakly held together by gravity, and tend to disperse after several hundreds of millions of years.\n\nGlobular clusters, on the other hand, orbit the Milky Way outside the galactic disk. They harbor tens of thousands to millions of stars. Tightly bound by gravity, globular clusters remain intact after 12 billion years.\n\nHow to see Omega Centauri\n\nOmega Centauri – the most luminous of all globular star clusters – is far to the south on the sky’s dome. It’s visible from the southern half of the United States, or south of 40 degrees north latitude (the latitude of Denver, Colorado and Beijing, China). Canadians hasten to remind us that they can spot Omega Centauri from as far north as Point Pelee in Canada (42 degrees north latitude). When seeing conditions are just right, they say they “… can catch the Omega Centauri star cluster skimming along the surface of Lake Erie.”\n\nFrom the Southern Hemisphere, Omega Centauri appears much higher in the sky and is a glorious sight.\n\nIf you’re in the Northern Hemisphere and want to spot this cluster, know that Omega Centauri can only be seen at certain times of the year. It’s best seen in the evening sky from the Northern Hemisphere late on April, May and June evenings.\n\nSo around mid-May, this wondrous star cluster is highest up and due south around 11 p.m. your local daylight saving time.\n\nThen, by mid-June, Omega Centauri is highest up and due south around 10 p.m. your local daylight saving time.\n\nNorthern Hemisphere residents can see Omega Centauri from January through April as well, but they must be willing to stay up past midnight or get up before dawn.\n\nUse the Big Dipper to find Spica\n\nFor those in the Northern Hemisphere, Spica, the brightest star in the constellation Virgo, serves as your guide star to Omega Centauri. When Spica and Omega Centauri transit – appear due south and reach the highest point in the sky – they do so in unison. However, Omega Centauri transits about 35 degrees south of (or below) sparkling blue-white Spica. For reference, your fist at arm’s length approximates 10 degrees of sky. Find Spica by following the arc in the handle of the Big Dipper.\n\nUse the search function in Stellarium-Web.org to locate sky objects as viewed from your location\n\nGenerally, open clusters visible to the unaided eye are hundreds to a few thousand light-years away. In contrast, globular clusters are generally tens of thousands of light-years distant.\n\nAt about 16,000 light-years, Omega Centauri is one of the few of our galaxy’s 150 or so globular clusters that is visible to the unaided eye. It shines at +3.9 magnitude. It looks like a faint, fuzzy star, but Omega Centauri’s mere presence testifies to its size and brilliance. Like any globular cluster, Omega Centauri is best viewed with a telescope.\n\nOmega Centauri’s position is at Right Ascension: 13h 26.8m; Declination: 47 degrees 29′ south.\n\nBottom line: The Milky Way’s largest globular star cluster, Omega Centauri, contains about 10 million stars. It’s visible from the Southern Hemisphere as well as parts of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nEnjoying EarthSky?

These stars provide compelling new evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole.\n\nIntermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a long-sought ‘missing link’ in black hole evolution. Only a few other IMBH candidates have been found to date. Most known black holes are either extremely massive, like the supermassive black holes that lie at the cores of large galaxies, or relatively lightweight, with a mass less than 100 times that of the Sun. Black holes are one of the most extreme environments humans are aware of, and so they are a testing ground for the laws of physics and our understanding of how the Universe works. If IMBHs exist, how common are they? Does a supermassive black hole grow from an IMBH? How do IMBHs themselves form? Are dense star clusters their favoured home?\n\nOmega Centauri is visible from Earth with the naked eye and is one of the favourite celestial objects for stargazers in the southern hemisphere. Although the cluster is 17 000 light-years away, lying just above the plane of the Milky Way, it appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark rural area. The exact classification of Omega Centauri has evolved through time, as our ability to study it has improved. It was first listed in Ptolemy's catalogue nearly 2000 years ago as a single star. Edmond Halley reported it as a nebula in 1677, and in the 1830s the English astronomer John Herschel was the first to recognise it as a globular cluster.\n\nGlobular clusters typically consist of up to one million old stars tightly bound together by gravity and are found both in the outskirts and central regions of many galaxies, including our own. Omega Centauri has several characteristics that distinguish it from other globular clusters: it rotates faster than a run-of-the-mill globular cluster, and its shape is highly flattened. Moreover, Omega Centauri is about 10 times as massive as other big globular clusters, almost as massive as a small galaxy.\n\nOmega Centauri consists of roughly 10 million stars that are gravitationally bound. An international team has now created an enormous catalogue of the motions of these stars, measuring the velocities for 1.4 million stars by studying over 500 Hubble images of the cluster. Most of these observations were intended to calibrate Hubble’s instruments rather than for scientific use, but they turned out to be an ideal database for the team’s research efforts. The extensive catalogue, which is the largest catalogue of motions for any star cluster to date, will be made openly available (more information is available here).\n\n“We discovered seven stars that should not be there,” explained Maximilian Häberle of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany, who led this investigation. “They are moving so fast that they should escape the cluster and never come back. The most likely explanation is that a very massive object is gravitationally pulling on these stars and keeping them close to the centre. The only object that can be so massive is a black hole, with a mass at least 8200 times that of our Sun.”\n\nSeveral studies have suggested the presence of an IMBH in Omega Centauri [1]. However, other studies proposed that the mass could be contributed by a central cluster of stellar-mass black holes, and had suggested the lack of fast-moving stars above the necessary escape velocity made an IMBH less likely in comparison.Omega Centauri - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Omega Centauri, ω Cen o NGC 5139 es un cúmulo globular situado en la constelación de Centaurus. Fue identificado como objeto nebuloso por primera vez por Edmond Halley en 1677. Este cúmulo orbita a través de nuestra galaxia, la Vía Láctea, siendo el más grande y brillante de los cúmulos globulares que la orbitan, su masa es de 4 millones de masas solares.[1]​ Omega Centauri también es el segundo cúmulo globular más masivo del grupo local de galaxias, solo Mayall II es más masivo. Es uno de los pocos (y el más brillante) que pueden ser observados a simple vista desde la Tierra. Omega Centauri está a unos 17 000 años luz (5 212.22 pc) de la Tierra y contiene varios millones de estrellas de Población II. Las estrellas de su centro están tan próximas entre sí que se cree que se encuentran a tan solo 0,1 años luz las unas de las otras. Su edad estimada es de cerca de 12 000 millones de años. Contiene alrededor de 10 millones de estrellas.\n\nA pesar de no ser realmente una estrella de la constelación del Centauro, recibió la letra griega ω en la denominación de Bayer como si lo fuera. Una característica que lo distingue de los demás cúmulos globulares de nuestra galaxia es que contiene estrellas de distintas generaciones. Por este motivo se especula que Omega Centauri puede ser el remanente del núcleo de una galaxia enana que fue satélite de nuestra Vía Láctea. Esta galaxia tendría un tamaño cientos de veces superior al actual de Omega Centauri y fue disgregada y absorbida por nuestra galaxia. La química y la dinámica de Omega Centauri son consistentes con esta hipótesis.\n\nAl igual que Mayall II, Omega Centauri presenta un rango de metalicidades y de edades estelares que llevan a pensar que no se formó de una sola vez (al contrario de lo que es normal en la mayoría de los cúmulos globulares).[2]​\n\nCuando se observa a simple vista en un sitio muy oscuro se puede ver del tamaño de la Luna llena[3]​ en el hemisferio sur, es circumpolar desde la latitud 43° sur y por lo tanto solo se eleva sobre el horizonte en el hemisferio norte hasta la latitud 43° norte (latitud de Toronto).\n\nEn 150 d. C., Ptolomeo catalogó este objeto estelar en su Almagesto como \"una estrella en el lomo del caballo\", (Quae est in principio scapulae). En 1603, Johann Bayer, en su Uranometria, utilizó los datos de Ptolomeo para denominarla Omega Centauri.[4]​ En 1677, Edmond Halley lo catalogó como objeto no-estelar en las observaciones que el astrónomo inglés realizó desde la isla de Santa Helena. Posteriormente, en 1715, Halley dijo de él que era una de las seis manchas o puntos luminosos en Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[5]​[6]​\n\nEn 1746, J.P. de Cheseaux la incluyó en su lista de 21 nebulosas. En 1755, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille le dio el número de catálogo L I.5. En 1826, James Dunlop lo reconoció como cúmulo globular y lo describió como un «bello globo estelar cuyas estrellas se concentraban de forma moderada y muy gradual hacia el centro».[6]​[7]​ como hizo el astrónomo francés Lacaille en 1755, de ahí que el número de catálogo se designe L I.5 .[8]​ Fue reconocido por primera vez como cúmulo globular por el astrónomo escocés James Dunlop en 1826, quien lo describió como un \"hermoso globo de estrellas muy gradual y moderadamente comprimido hacia el centro\".[9]​[10]​\n\nA una distancia aproximada de 17090 años luz (5,240 parsecs) de la Tierra, Omega Centauri es uno de los pocos cúmulos globulares visibles a simple vista, y parece casi tan grande como la Luna llena cuando se ve desde una zona rural oscura.[11]​ Es el más brillante, el más grande y, con 4 millones de masa solares,[12]​ el cúmulo globular más masivo conocido asociado a la Vía Láctea. De todos los cúmulos globulares del Grupo Local de galaxias, sólo Mayall II en la Galaxia de Andrómeda es más brillante y masivo.[13]​ Orbitando a través de la Vía Láctea, Omega Centauri contiene varios millones de estrellas de Población II y tiene unos 12 000 millones de años.[14]​\n\nLas estrellas del núcleo de Omega Centauri están tan amontonadas que se calcula que se encuentran a una distancia media de sólo 0,1 años luz unas de otras.[14]​ La dinámica interna se ha analizado utilizando mediciones de las velocidades radiales de 469 estrellas.[15]​ Los miembros de este cúmulo orbitan alrededor del centro de masa con una dispersión de velocidad máxima de 7,9 km s-1. La distribución de masa inferida a partir de la cinemática está ligeramente más extendida que la distribución de luminosidad, aunque no es fuertemente inconsistente con ella.\n\nUn estudio de 2008 presentó evidencia de un agujero negro de masa intermedia en el centro de Omega Centauri, basado en observaciones realizadas por el Telescopio Espacial Hubble y el Observatorio Gemini en Cerro Pachón en Chile.[16]​[17]​ La cámara avanzada para muestreos del Hubble mostró que las estrellas se agrupan cerca del centro de Omega Centauri, como lo demuestra el aumento gradual de la luz estelar cerca del centro. Usando instrumentos en el Observatorio Gemini para medir la velocidad de las estrellas que se arremolinan en el núcleo del cúmulo, E. Noyola y sus colegas encontraron que las estrellas más cercanas al núcleo se mueven más rápido que las estrellas más lejanas. Esta medida se interpretó en el sentido de que la materia invisible en el núcleo está interactuando gravitacionalmente con las estrellas cercanas. Al comparar estos resultados con modelos estándar, los astrónomos concluyeron que la causa más probable era la atracción gravitacional de un objeto denso y masivo como un agujero negro. Calcularon la masa del objeto en 40.000 masas solares.[16]​\n\nSin embargo, un trabajo más reciente ha desafiado estas conclusiones, en particular, disputando la ubicación propuesta del centro del cúmulo.[18]​[19]​ Los cálculos que utilizaron una ubicación revisada para el centro encontraron que la velocidad de las estrellas del núcleo no varía con la distancia, como se esperaría si estuviera presente un agujero negro de masa intermedia. Los mismos estudios también encontraron que la luz de las estrellas no aumenta hacia el centro, sino que permanece relativamente constante. Los autores señalaron que sus resultados no descartan por completo el agujero negro propuesto por Noyola y sus colegas, pero no lo confirman, y limitan su masa máxima a 12.000 masas solares.\n\nSe ha especulado que Omega Centauri es el núcleo de una galaxia enana que fue perturbada y absorbida por la Vía Láctea.[20]​ De hecho, se cree que la Estrella de Kapteyn, que actualmente se encuentra a sólo 13 años luz de la Tierra, tiene su origen en Omega Centauri.[21]​ La química y el movimiento de Omega Centauri en la Vía Láctea también concuerdan con esta imagen.[21]​ La química y el movimiento de Omega Centauri en la Vía Láctea también son coherentes con esta imagen.[21]​ Al igual que Mayall II, Omega Centauri tiene un rango de metalicidades y edades estelares que sugiere que no se formó todo a la vez (como se cree que se forman los cúmulos globulares) y que, de hecho, puede ser el resto del núcleo de una galaxia más pequeña incorporada hace tiempo a la Vía Láctea.[22]​\n\nLa novela Singularity (2012), de Ian Douglas, presenta como un hecho que Omega Centauri y Kapteyn's Star se originan en una galaxia enana perturbada, y este origen es central en la trama de la novela. A medida que avanza la historia, se discuten varios aspectos científicos de Omega Centauri, como el probable entorno de radiación dentro del cúmulo y el aspecto que podría tener el cielo desde el interior del cúmulo.[23]​\n\nEste cúmulo aparece en la serie de ciencia ficción alemana Perry Rhodan, y un ciclo de la serie derivada Atlan, está ambientado en Omega Centauri.\n• Omega Centauri en ESA/Hubble (inglés).

She is the first woman to hold the office. Previously, Tomegah Dogbé was the minister of Grassroots Development, Handicrafts, Youth and Youth Employment in the government of Komi Sélom Klassou and also the Cabinet Director of President Faure Gnassingbé.[1][2]\n\nFollowing the constitutional reform in March 2024 which transformed Togo from a presidential system to a parliamentary one and where the role of president became ceremonial and the role of prime minister became the most powerful job in the country with it being renamed \"President of the Council of Ministers\" (Président du Conseil des Ministres), Tomegah Dzidudu was reappointed as prime minister under the new constitution by President Gnassingbé in August.\n\nIn 2008, while she was at the United Nations Development Programme office in Benin, the President of the Republic Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé and the Prime Minister Gilbert Houngbo asked Tomégah Dogbé to manage the portfolio of Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister in charge of development at the base which had just been created in Togo.[3]\n\nIn 2010, following the re-election of President Faure Gnassingbé, Tomegah Dogbé was appointed Minister of Grassroots Development, Youth Craft and Youth Employment in Gilbert Houngbo's second mandate. She retained her ministerial functions in the 1st government of Kwesi Ahoomey-Zunu from 2012 to 2013 and the 2nd government of Ahoomey-Zunu from 2013 to 2015. After the presidential election of April 2015, Komi Sélom Klassou replaced Ahoomey-Zunu as prime minister on 5 June 2015. Klaassou formed his cabinet on 28 June 2015 in which Tomegah Dogbé still retained the Ministry of Development at the Base, crafts, youth and youth employment.[4]\n\nTobegah Dogbe was named prime minister on 28 September 2020 by President Faure Gnassingbe after the resignation of Komi Selom Klassou.[5]DG welcomes the Head of Government of Togo, Victoire Tomegah Dogbe, to the WTO: The Director-General thanked the Prime Minister, the first woman to hold the post in Togo for the country's continued support of the multilateral trading system and for its engagement at the WTO and the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF). She encouraged the Government of Togo to implement the outcomes from the WTO's 12th Ministerial Conference in June 2022 and to work towards a successful 13th Ministerial Conference next February.\n\nThe Director-General also urged the Prime Minister and her Government to quickly deposit Togo's instrument of acceptance of the Fisheries Subsidies Agreement, noting that Africa is a victim of the illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The benefits of the new Agreement include, amongst other things, the combatting of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and fishing of overfished stocks whilst at the same time safeguarding the livelihood of artisanal fisherfolk. Those subsidies would be prohibited once two-thirds of the WTO's membership has accepted the Agreement.\n\nTogo has been a member of WTO since May 1995 and a member of the WTO's predecessor, the GATT, since March 1964.Togo names first female Prime Minister: Togo’s President Faure Gnassingbe has appointed the country’s first female prime minister.\n\nVictoire Tomegah Dogbe, 60, became the first female prime minister of the tiny West African nation of about eight million people.\n\nDogbe, whose appointment was confirmed by President Faure Gnassingbe on Monday, replaces Komi Selom Klassou, who resigned as prime minister on Friday, a position he held since 2015.\n\nDogbe is well known and respected in Togo, having served in several positions under Gnassingbe’s government in the past decade, including working as his chief-of-staff, director of the cabinet of the President of the Republic and more recently as Minister for youth and grassroots development, according to local media reports.\n\nPrior to joining politics, she worked with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) according to information from the agency.\n\nHer appointment comes after an expected cabinet reshuffle, which was delayed by the country’s fight against coronavirus pandemic, following the controversial re-election of Gnassingbe, who has ruled Togo since 2005.\n\nHe took power from his father who, before his death, ruled Togo for 38 years, dating back to a 1967 coup. \n\n\n\nDespite a series of protests between 2017 – 2019 calling for an end to a single family rule in Togo, Gnassingbe forced a constitutional reform in 2019 that allowed him to run for an election which he won easily in February 2020. His current tenure runs till 2025. \n\n\n\nThe 56-year-old leader has seen growing opposition, following slowed economic growth, accusations of electoral fraud, corruption and human rights violations.\n\nDogbe’s has vast experience in governance and administration which is well positioned to help the country achieve a long-expected economic boom which has eluded the country since independence in 1960.\n\nDogbe has been deeply involved in the country’s fight against youth unemployment and poverty, introducing reforms that have been praised as a local success in her country, according to Togo-First, an online publication in the country.\n\nAs the parliament awaits Dogbe’s policy plan, observers are keen to see what economic difference her reforms can make in a country where half its population live below the poverty line, according to a 2014 report by the International Monetary Fund."}

Meet Your Admissions CounselorMartin (TV series) - Wikipedia: Martin is an American television sitcom that aired for five seasons on Fox from August 27, 1992, to May 1, 1997. The show stars comedian Martin Lawrence as the titular character. Lawrence also played several other characters. Martin was one of Fox's highest-rated shows during the sitcom's run. In 2024, the cast reunited at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards.[1]\n\nMartin Lawrence played the role of Martin Payne, originally a disc jockey who lived with his girlfriend Gina Waters (Tisha Campbell) in the city of Detroit, Michigan. Martin worked for the fictional radio station WZUP; in later seasons, he became the host of the talk show Word on the Street.[2]\n\nIn November 1996, Campbell left the series during its final season, citing \"intolerable\" working conditions. She filed a lawsuit against Lawrence and the show's producers in January 1997 for sexual harassment and verbal and physical assaults.[6] The series explanation was that Gina was \"out on business\", though in the two-part episode \"Going Overboard\" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else.[7] By April 1997, Campbell had settled the lawsuit and returned for the last two episodes of the series under the condition that she would not share any scenes or interact with Lawrence.[8] Campbell and Lawrence have since reconciled, and repaired their relationship.[9]\n\nMartin went into second run syndication on August 8, 1995 through Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution; it airs multiple times a week on the networks of Paramount Global, including MTV2, VH1 and BET, with Netflix also carrying the full run of the series.\n\nBesides being purchasable on most digital video retailers, HBO Home Video released all five seasons of Martin on DVD in Region 1.\n\nOn July 11, 2024, an hourlong prequel series to Martin, titled Young Martin, was announced to be in development by Deadline Hollywood. The series is executive produced by Martin Lawrence, Rae Proctor, Robert Lawrence and Stacy Lyles from RunTelDat, with Bob Yari, David McPherson, Rosa Peart, Greg Martin for WonderHill Studios,\n\nYoung Martin follows a teenage Martin Payne residing in a modern-day Detroit finding his path to success as he transitions from childhood to adulthood and is described as both an origin story and a reimagining of the character.[10]"}

She was in their service from 1954-97. She was the 83rd such vessel since King Charles II acceded to the throne in 1660, and is the second royal yacht to bear the name, the first being the racing cutter built for the Prince of Wales in 1893. During her 43-year career, the yacht travelled more than a million nautical miles around the world to more than 600 ports in 135 countries.[2] Now retired from royal service, Britannia is permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal, Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland, where it is a visitor attraction with over 300,000 visits each year.[3]\n\nHMY Britannia was built at the shipyard of John Brown & Co. Ltd in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire. She was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 April 1953, and commissioned on 11 January 1954. The ship was designed with three masts: a 133-foot (41 m) foremast, a 139-foot (42 m) mainmast, and a 118-foot (36 m) mizzenmast. The top aerial on the foremast and the top 20 feet (6.1 m) of the mainmast were hinged to allow the ship to pass under bridges.\n\nBritannia it was claimed (as justification for the cost) was designed to be converted into a hospital ship in time of war,[4] however when the need came in the Falklands War this capability was exposed as being spurious as HMY Britannia, unique among the Royal Navy's fleet, required special fuel oil (unique to her) and had only a 200-bed capacity. Instead, the 16,907-gross-register-ton (47,880 m3) P&O liner SS Uganda, which was in the Mediterranean on an educational cruise with a thousand schoolchildren on board, was requisitioned, and modified to become a hospital ship.\n\nIn the event of nuclear war, it was intended for the Queen and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to take refuge aboard Britannia off the north-west coast of Scotland.[5]\n\nRoyal Navy officers were appointed for up to two years. The crew were volunteers from the general service of the Royal Navy. After 365 days' service, they could be admitted to the Permanent Royal Yacht Service as Royal Yachtsmen and serve until they chose to leave the service or were dismissed for medical or disciplinary reasons. As a result, some served for 20 years or more. The crew also included a detachment of Royal Marines.[6] A contingent of Royal Marines Band members embarked whenever Britannia was on duty away from home port.[7]\n\nBritannia sailed on her maiden voyage from Portsmouth to Grand Harbour, Malta, departing on 14 April and arriving on 22 April 1954. She carried Prince Charles and Princess Anne to Malta in order for them to meet the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the end of the royal couple's Commonwealth tour. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh embarked on Britannia for the first time in Tobruk on 1 May 1954.[8]\n\nOn 20 July 1959, Britannia sailed the newly opened Saint Lawrence Seaway en route from Canada to Chicago, where she docked, making the Queen the first British monarch to visit the city. U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower was aboard Britannia for part of this cruise; Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton were welcomed aboard in later years. Anne and Mark Phillips took their honeymoon cruise aboard the ship in 1973; Charles would do the same with Diana in 1981. The ship evacuated over 1,000 refugees from the civil war in Aden in 1986.[9] The vessel sailed to Canada in 1991 and made a port of call in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario.\n\nHMY Britannia, when on royal duties, was escorted by a Royal Navy warship. The yacht was a regular sight at Cowes Week in early August and, usually, for the remainder of the month, was home to the Queen and her family for an annual cruise around the islands off the west coast of Scotland (known as the \"Western Isles Tour\").\n\nDuring her career as Royal Yacht, Britannia conveyed the Queen, other members of the Royal Family and various dignitaries on 696 foreign visits and 272 visits in British waters. In this time, Britannia steamed 1,087,623 nautical miles (2,014,278 km).[10]\n\nIn 1994, the Conservative government announced the yacht's retirement:\n\nIn January 1997, the government committed itself to replacing the Royal Yacht if reelected.[11] The timing of the announcement, close to a general election, was controversial; The Guardian Weekly called it \"part of a populist appeal to wavering Tory voters in the run-up to the general election\" and reported that the Queen was \"furious\" that the Royal Family was \"dragged into the centre of the election campaign, just as it is fighting to restore its public image.\"[12] Sir Edward Heath publicly objected to the government's handling of the issue, stating \"The Conservative Party above all must be an honourable party. And I don't believe the actions that have been taken are honourable ones and should never have been taken in this way.\"[13]\n\nThe government argued that the cost was justified by its role in foreign policy and promoting British interests abroad, particularly through conferences held by British Invisibles, formerly the Committee on Invisible Exports. It was estimated by the Overseas Trade Board that events held on board the yacht helped raise £3 billion for HM Treasury between 1991 and 1995 alone.[14][15]\n\nThe Labour opposition announced it would not commit the use of public funds for a replacement vessel for at least the first two years of any new Labour government.[16] After its election victory in May 1997, the new government considered multiple options for the future of a royal yacht, but concluded in October of that year that Britannia would not be replaced:\n\nThe Royal Yacht's final foreign mission was to convey the last Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, and the Prince of Wales back from Hong Kong after its handover to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997. Britannia was decommissioned on 11 December 1997. The Queen, normally undemonstrative in public, was reported to have cried at the decommissioning ceremony that was attended by most of the senior members of the Royal Family.[18]\n\nListed as part of the National Historic Fleet, Britannia is a visitor attraction moored in the historic Port of Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is cared for by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, a registered charity.[19] There was some controversy over the siting of the ship, with some arguing that she would be better moored on the River Clyde, where she was built, than in Edinburgh, with which the yacht had few links. Her positioning in Leith coincided with a redevelopment of the harbour area and the advent of Scottish devolution.\n\nEntrance to the yacht is via the Ocean Terminal development, and over 300,000 people visit the Royal Yacht Britannia every year. She is one of the UK's top evening events venues. On 18 May 2006, the Swiss-born Hollywood actress and first Bond girl, Ursula Andress, celebrated her 70th birthday on board. On 29 July 2011, a drinks reception was held on board Britannia for Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Phillips and her then fiancé, Mike Tindall, to celebrate their forthcoming wedding.[20]\n\nAn early Land Rover in much-restored shape is displayed in the on-board garage and a retired Rolls-Royce Phantom V state car is parked on the wharf below the ship. The tour of the five decks open to the public includes the Queen's bedroom, which can be viewed behind a glass wall, and the state dining and drawing rooms, which hosted grand receptions for kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers throughout the world. The clocks on board are stopped at 3:01, the time that the Queen last disembarked.[21] The royal deck tea room was added in 2009.\n\nThe 1936 racing yacht Bloodhound, once owned by the Queen and Prince Philip, is now berthed alongside Britannia. Bloodhound was one of the most successful ocean-racing yachts ever built and was the yacht on which King Charles III and the Princess Royal learned to sail. The Royal Yacht Britannia Trust bought Bloodhound in early 2010 and she is the centrepiece of an exhibition focusing on the Royal Family's passion for sailing. Visitors can view Bloodhound from a specially built pontoon when the racing yacht is in port. During July and August, she is berthed in Oban marina and is available for private charter, as she sails around the islands once visited by the Royal Family during their annual fortnight holiday in the Western Isles of Scotland. During this period, Royal Yachtsmen (Yotties) from Britannia's original crew sail the yacht for the Britannia Trust.\n\nFrom 2019, the MV Fingal has been permanently berthed near to the Britannia at the Albert Dock Basin. The Fingal is a former Northern Lighthouse Board ship converted into a boutique hotel owned by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust.[22]\n\nProposals for the construction of a new royal yacht, perhaps financed through a loan or by the royal family's own funds, have made little headway. In December 2019 it was reported that the late Sir Donald Gosling donated £50 million in his will to pay for it.[23]\n\nIn May 2021, it was reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would announce the construction of a new royal yacht, named after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, \"within weeks\".[24] On 29 May, Johnson announced that the \"new national flagship\" – a ship rather than a luxury yacht – would enter service within the next four years and cost up to £200 million.[25][26] The following day it was reported that government plans to name the ship after the Duke of Edinburgh were not well-received amongst royal sources, and these plans had subsequently been \"abandoned\".[27] By 2022 plans had progressed to two favoured design teams.[28] It was reported in October 2022 that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was planning to scrap plans for a new yacht as part of a package of spending cuts.[29]\n• K1 Britannia, a planned replica of King George V's racing yacht Britannia to be used for charitable purposes.\n• Hebridean Princess, twice chartered by Queen Elizabeth II since the retirement of HMY Britannia.\n• List of royal yachts of the United Kingdom\n• Official website of the Royal Yacht BritanniaThe Royal Yacht Britannia Official Website | Best Visitor Attraction and Exclusive Evening Events Venue in Edinburgh: Please pre-book your tickets to guarantee admission.\n\nStart your tour at our entrance on the Ground Floor of Ocean Terminal.\n\nA great day out for all the family, explore each of the five decks at this top attraction in Edinburgh and discover what life was like on board Queen Elizabeth II's former floating palace.Buy Admissions Tickets online - The Royal Yacht Britannia: Select a time to arrive.

For over 44 years the Royal Yacht served the Royal Family, travelling more than a million nautical miles to become one of the most famous ships in the world. To Queen Elizabeth II, Britannia provided the perfect Royal residence for glittering state visits, official receptions, Royal honeymoons and relaxing family holidays. For Great Britain, she was a majestic symbol of the Commonwealth and a proud ambassador generating billions of pounds in trade deals. For the Royal Family and 220 dedicated crew of Royal Yachtsmen, she was home.\n\nToday, Britannia is a five-star visitor attraction and exclusive evening events venue in Edinburgh.Thousand Islands Life, Queen Elizabeth II & \"HMY Britannia\": Like the rest of the world, we in the Thousand Islands will have our own personal memories of the Queen. Looking up photographs of the Queen's yacht, we discovered that our own Lynn McElfresh had written a lovely article for TI Life in April 2013! This article is well worth re-reading. Also, this week we received a revised article by Rick Casali from his original version published by the TI Sun in 2021. We include extracts from the articles here.\n\nDescription of several rooms followed Read the complete article here: https://tilife.org/BackIssues/Archive/tabid/393/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1202/Her-Majestyrsquos-Royal-Yacht.html\n\nThe Queen and the President were near Massena, NY, to open the canal’s Eisenhower Lock for the ship to pass through. The destroyer HMCS Kootenay and U. S. Army howitzer batteries gave the Queen and the President a number of 21-gun salutes during the dedication. And Vice President Richard Nixon greeted the Queen and Prince in\n\nMassena, where 100,000 celebrants were on hand to greet the dignitaries, and to commemorate the Moses-Saunders Dam as well as the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Massena Central High School band played “God Save the Queen” and “The Star-Spangled Banner” as part of the dedication ceremony. Also on hand was New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Also on hand was New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller.\n\nThe Britannia paused off the St. Regis Reservation, as she entered U. S. waters. And she then proceeded up the St. Lawrence River, and on June 28, 1959 passed under the 1000 Island Bridge span in the American Channel. So, she passed by Wellesley Island, Boldt Castle, Grindstone Island, Alexandria Bay, and Clayton, NY. It would have been special to witness her transit through North Country waters. In fact, this cruise of the \"Britannia\" was making history as this was the first British monarch to visit the North\n\nCountry.\n\nAfter passing under the bridge, Queen Elizabeth and the \"Britannia\" made landfall in Kingston, Ont. The monarch then visited Toronto and Chicago on board the \"Britannia\". President Eisenhower was reported to be on board the royal yacht for a portion of the voyage. Everywhere that the Queen visited, she was warmly welcomed by both Canadians and Americans.

The lives of police chief Kevin Garvey (Justin Theroux) and his family, along with grieving widow Nora Durst (Carrie Coon) and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison (Christopher Eccleston), are the focal points of the series as they struggle to adjust to life after the Departure.\n\nThe pilot was written by Lindelof and Perrotta and directed by Peter Berg.[3] The series stars an ensemble cast led by Theroux and features Amy Brenneman, Christopher Eccleston, Liv Tyler, Chris Zylka, Margaret Qualley, Carrie Coon, Ann Dowd, Regina King, Jovan Adepo, Kevin Carroll, Janel Moloney, and Scott Glenn. The series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on October 4, 2015, and concluded December 6, 2015.[4] On December 10, 2015, at Lindelof's request to be able to conclude the series, HBO renewed it for a third and final season,[6] which premiered on April 16, 2017, and concluded on June 4, 2017.[7] Over the course of the series, 28 episodes aired over three seasons.\n\nThe first season received mostly positive reviews, though some criticized the series for its grim tone.[8] The series underwent a critical reevaluation during its acclaimed second and third seasons,[9][10] with many critics referring to The Leftovers as one of the greatest television series of all time,[11][12][13][14][15] with particular praise for its writing, directing, acting (particularly Theroux's and Coon's) and thematic depth.[8][9][10] The musical score composed by Max Richter also attracted critical praise.[16] Despite receiving average Nielsen ratings throughout its run, the series has developed a cult following.[17][18] The series has been compared favorably to Lost, a previous series co-created by Lindelof.[19][20][21][22]\n\nThe Leftovers starts three years after a global event called the \"Sudden Departure\", the inexplicable, simultaneous disappearance of 140 million people, 2% of the world's population, on October 14, 2011.[23] Following that event, mainstream religions declined, and a number of cults emerged, most notably the Guilty Remnant, a group of white-clothed, chain-smoking nihilists, and a cult led by Holy Wayne, a man who views himself as the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.[24]\n\nThe first season revolves around the Garvey family and their acquaintances in a fictionalized version of the town of Mapleton, New York. Kevin Garvey Jr. is the chief of police. His wife, Laurie, has joined the Guilty Remnant. Their son, Tommy, has left home to become a follower of Holy Wayne, and their daughter, Jill, is acting out.[2] Meanwhile, grieving widow Nora Durst and her brother, Reverend Matt Jamison, struggle to deal with their respective traumas while adjusting to life post-Departure. It also follows Meg Abbott, a woman who is slowly seduced by the Mapleton faction of the Guilty Remnant, led by Patti Levin. These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.\n\nIn the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the fictional town of Jarden, Texas, where not a single citizen was lost in the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town, also acting as a vigilante deterrent of people exploiting Jarden's \"miracle\". His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is an aspiring pastor and their daughter, Evie, is a high school student with epilepsy. The Garvey family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.\n\nThe third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting 14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure. The setting of the third season moves between Jarden and Victoria, Australia, as most of the lead characters—particularly the Garvey and Murphy families—undergo emotional journeys that make them reflect upon their lives, their beliefs, and the events they have encountered in the previous two seasons.

He served as the series' showrunner.[2]\n\nIn February 2013, HBO ordered a pilot and, in September, ordered a 10-episode first season.[29][30] The Leftovers is the first series HBO acquired from an outside studio that it did not produce in-house.[31]\n\nThe first season covers the entirety of the book; the second and third seasons are completely original material.[32][33] In April 2015, it was reported that the setting for the second season would shift from Mapleton, New York to a small town in Texas.[34] The series shifted filming locations from New York to Austin, Texas, with nearby Lockhart serving as the main street of fictional Jarden, Texas, when principal photography commenced in late April.[35][36] For the second season, which features several changes, including cast, location, and storylines; Lindelof cited The Wire and Friday Night Lights as influences.[37][38]\n\nThe final season began principal photography in early May 2016, in Austin.[33] In June 2016, the production moved to Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, where it filmed the remainder of the series and completed post-production. On the move to Melbourne, Lindelof said, \"We're immensely grateful for the opportunity to try something that looks and feels different from the preceding seasons and we absolutely cannot wait to bring our story to its conclusion down under.\"[39][40] It was also confirmed that the season would have a shortened 8-episode run.[41]\n\nIn June 2013, casting announcements began. Justin Theroux, Liv Tyler, Christopher Eccleston, Ann Dowd, Amanda Warren, Michael Gaston, and Carrie Coon were announced to star in the pilot.[42][43][44]\n\nFor the second season, eight of the 14 main cast members from season one returned, while Emily Meade, Amanda Warren, Annie Q., Max Carver, Charlie Carver and Michael Gaston did not.[45] In April 2015, casting began for a family comprising ex-convict John Murphy; his hearing-impaired doctor wife, Erika; and their teenage children Evie, an outgoing athlete, and Michael, a pious Christian.[34] The roles of John, Erika, and Michael are portrayed by Kevin Carroll, Regina King and Jovan Adepo, respectively, all as series regulars.[46][47] Darius McCrary was cast in a recurring role as Isaac Rayney, John's friend and a palm reader.[47] Steven Williams was cast in a recurring role, playing Virgil, a confidant of Kevin's.[48] Janel Moloney, who had a recurring role in the first season as Mary Jamison, was promoted to a regular cast member in season two.\n\nFor the third season, it was confirmed in May 2016 that the entire main cast from the second season would return, with the exception of Dowd, and that Scott Glenn and Jasmin Savoy Brown had been promoted to series regulars.[41] Glenn is credited as part of the main cast for the five season 3 episodes in which he appears; Brown ultimately remained as a recurring guest star, appearing in three episodes of the season. Lindsay Duncan joined the cast on December 6, 2016, also as a recurring guest star.[49] Duncan appears in five episodes of the season.\n\nSeveral cast members did not continue in a regular capacity during season 3, but retain main cast credit for the episodes in which they feature. Liv Tyler appears in one scene in the first episode, and returns for one subsequent appearance in episode 7. Ann Dowd also returns to the main cast in episode 7 only. Margaret Qualley appears in the season's first episode only, with one subsequent voice cameo. Regina King appears in episode 2 only, and Janel Moloney features in two episodes. Chris Zylka appears for the final time in episode 2, making only one subsequent voice cameo, but retains his credit as a main cast member for the entire season. Additionally, season 1 main cast members Michael Gaston and Annie Q. return as guest stars.\n\nThe main title from the first season uses \"The Leftovers (Main Title Theme)\", an original piece of music by composer Max Richter, accompanied by images like a fresco in the style of the Sistine Chapel. The second season uses \"Let the Mystery Be\" by Iris DeMent. In addition, the opening changes to one that shows images of pictures and people who were departed missing from them and in their place is various images of earth-related phenomena like rain, clouds, aurora borealis and lightning. Season 3 retains the opening from Season 2 but with a different theme song for each episode, including reprises of the Season 1 main title theme and \"Let the Mystery Be\" in episodes seven and eight respectively. This is because Damon Lindelof wants to \"thematically introduce the episode to come\" with different title music for each episode.\n• \"Nothing's Gonna Stop Me Now\" (theme from Perfect Strangers) by David Pomeranz\n• \"This Love Is Over\" by Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs\n• \"Let the Mystery Be\" by Iris DeMent\n\nThe first season of The Leftovers received mostly positive reviews from critics. Metacritic scored season one 65 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[50] Rotten Tomatoes scored the season 82%, based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 7.65/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Its dour tone and self-seriousness may make for somber viewing, but The Leftovers is an artfully crafted, thought-provoking drama that aims high and often hits its mark.\"[8] IGN reviewer Matt Fowler gave consistently high scores to all the season one episodes, including two perfect 10 scores for \"Two Boats and a Helicopter\" and the season finale \"The Prodigal Son Returns.\"[51] He then gave the entire first season a review score of 9.4 out of 10, particularly praising the character-centric episodes, Max Richter's score and the performances, particularly Carrie Coon's.[52]\n\nThe second season received critical acclaim. On Metacritic, it has a score of 80 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[53] Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a rating of 94% with an average score of 8.8/10 based on 164 critic reviews, with the critical consensus \"The Leftovers continues to be unpredictable and provocative in season two with its new location, though the inexplicable circumstances will still frustrate many viewers.\"[9] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix gave it an \"A\" grade and wrote that \"The Leftovers is still TV's best drama as season 2 begins\"; it has \"tighter focus, but same powerful, immersive experience\".[54] In her five out of five star review, Emily St. James of Vox wrote: \"It's a show that wants to provoke a reaction in you, whether it's admiration, hatred, or just bafflement. It's HBO's best drama—and thus must-see TV.\"[55]\n\nThe third and final season received unanimous acclaim from critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 98 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[56] On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 99% rating with an average score of 9.35/10 based on 189 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"With reliably ambitious storytelling and outstanding performances from its cast, Season 3 of The Leftovers approaches the series' conclusion as thoughtfully, purposefully, and confidently as it began.\"[10] Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote the final season \"is spectacular, in every sense of that word.\"[57] The Leftovers was ranked as the best TV series of 2017 according to Metacritic.[58] Alan Sepinwall placed season three first on his list of the best TV shows of 2017, an accolade he had awarded to both previous seasons in their respective years. He said \"this has been my show of the year — of the decade, maybe, depending on how we count things like Mad Men and Breaking Bad that debuted in the '00s\"; he went on to say \"the eight-episode final season was a miracle\".[59]\n\nAccording to Metacritic's aggregate of critics' decade-end lists, The Leftovers was the fifth-highest ranked show of the 2010s.[60]\n\nThe first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD in region 1 on October 6, 2015. The set contains two audio commentaries and four behind-the-scenes featurettes.[84] The second season was released on Blu-ray and DVD on February 9, 2016.[85] The third season's DVD format was released on October 10, 2017, while the Blu-ray format was released by the Warner Archive Collection.[86]The Leftovers (TV Series 2014–2017) ⭐ 8.3 | Drama, Fantasy, Mystery: The Leftovers is not only one of the most underrated TV shows of all-time but it's one of the best tv shows of all-time!

It is usually manufactured as a powder from corn gluten meal. Zein is one of the best understood plant proteins.[1] Pure zein is clear, odorless, tasteless, hard, water-insoluble, and edible, and it has a variety of industrial and food uses.[2][3]\n\nHistorically, zein has been used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric,[4] buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \"Vicara\".[2][5] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.[6][7] It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability.[8]\n\nZein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \"confectioner's glaze\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products[9] or as \"vegetable protein.\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs.[citation needed]\n\nZein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.[10][11] With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.[12][13] Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications.[citation needed]\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.[14] They are also studying medical applications such as using the zein molecule to \"carry biocompounds to targeted sites in the human body\".[15] There are a number of potential food safety applications that may be possible for zein-based packaging according to several researchers. A military contractor is researching the use of zein to protect MRE food packages.[16] Other packaging/food safety applications that have been researched include frozen foods,[17] ready-to-eat chicken,[18] and cheese and liquid eggs.[19] Food researchers in Japan have noted the ability of the zein molecule to act as a water barrier.[20]\n\nWhile there are numerous existing and potential uses for zein, the main barrier to greater commercial success has been its historic high cost until recently. Zein pricing is now very competitive with food shellac. Zein may be extracted as a byproduct in the manufacturing process for ethanol[21] or in new off-shore manufacture.[citation needed]\n\nAlpha-prolamins are the major seed storage proteins of species of the grass tribe Andropogoneae. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication.[22] In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes;[23] twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.[24]ZO® Skin Health | Medical Skin Care: The season of gifting brings about so many questions of what to get for your loved ones.

Evidently there was a police force in charge of crowd control during the making of that movie that was, ah, interestingly diverse to the point that it caught Maslansky's attention and inspired him to approach a sergeant and ask him why there were so many gym class drop-outs on the force. The sergeant replied that they had a fair employment policy in place that compelled them to accept any applicant who took an interest in becoming an officer, but then with a wink he explained that they could flunk out whoever they wanted after three weeks. Instantly, a light bulb popped on above Maslansky's head.\n\n\n\nDo you see what this means? Police Academy is based on a true story!!\n\n\n\nIn response to public discontent as a result of a crime wave that has been sweeping the city, the Mayor puts in place a new rule forcing the Police Department to accept any new applicant regardless of age, height, weight, sex, background, attitude, religion, nationality, IQ, criminal history, or SAT score, which causes the police academy to be bombarded with societal aberrations the likes of which would surely cause the public more concern than the criminals causing the crime wave in the first place. \n\n\n\nNo nonsense Police Chief Henry Hurst is immediately and thoroughly appalled at the new ruling as he watches the dregs of society flood his beloved police academy, while Commandant Lassard sits in his chair and cheerfully allows the curious developments of life to happen around him as they will. Most of the recruits that become central to the story are honest people who really want to be police officers, except for Casey Mahoney (Steve Guttenburg, in a career-making-and-then-breaking role), who is forced into the academy as an alternative to jail. \n\n\n\nHow could anyone at any time ever be offered the choice of becoming a police officer or going to jail? Watch the movie and you'll find out, but it doesn't really matter. It has to do with Mahoney having a powerful father, but the point is that Mahoney is a smart-ass who has not a scrap of respect for authority and who is determined to get himself booted out of the academy before lunch on the first day. The academy is equally happy to be rid of him, but for circumstances beyond either of their controls, this is not an option. It's a preposterous situation, but you have to admire it's simplicity and effectiveness in paving the way for a whole movie full of slapstick hilarity.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the relevant cast provide the springboard from which six sequels sprouted in subsequent years. Indeed, the plots of the movies run a distant second to who is back for each subsequent movie. Moses Hightower is a towering black man who became tired of being a florist, of all things, and decided to become a cop. His counterpart is Cadet Hooks, a mousy black woman with the voice of a stretched balloon who, among other things, must learn to speak with authority. Larvell Jones comes from a background similar to Mahoney's in a lot of ways but is better known for his ability to imitate the sound of almost anything (this was also a career-making-and-breaking role for Michael Winslow). Then there are Tackleberry, the trigger-happy but hilarious gun fanatic, Karen Thompson, the attractive cadet played by Kim Cattrall who provides a welcome distraction for Mahoney, the overweight and perfectly named Leslie Barbara (a man), and Doug Fackler, a priceless geek who is prone to cause accidents that don't affect himself. And overseeing them all is the delightfully creepy Lieutenant Harris, who is determined that they shall all fail miserably. \n\n\n\nThis should seem like an exceedingly easy task, but as they say, never underestimate the power of stupid people in large numbers!\n\n\n\nThe first movie in the Police Academy saga follows little more than the adventures of the recruits described above as they work their way through the police academy. There is a delightful competition between Lieutenant Harris, who treats his job with deadly seriousness as needed to ensure his own advancement, and the rest of the recruits, with Commandant Lassard popping up occasionally to fulfill the duties of a man clearly more interested in goldfish than law enforcement, but it's impossible not to love the guy.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of which, Lassard is the, umm, \"victim\" of one of the movie's more childish and unamusing jokes. I am not sure how successful the joke was when the movie was first released (I was 5 years old at the time and can't remember my initial reaction), but it is an unfortunate representative of much of the rest of the movie. \n\n\n\nPolice Academy is a milestone in the evolution of the cheesy comedy, there are no two ways about that, but the comedy in the movie has, ah, not dated well. Modern audiences will find not a single genuinely funny moment in the entire movie, but it would be madness to say that this means the movie isn't any fun.\n\n\n\nI remember when I was a kid I used to drive my brother nuts because I always wanted to watch Police Academy movies over and over again, but at some point I lost interest, and didn't gain interest again until about a week ago when I stumbled across the Police Academy DVD collection. But for an amusing trip to the comedy of the past, you can hardly do better. Grab a couple beers, bring your buddies over, and relish the comedy of your childhood. There were never any Academy Awards in mind, but I'm willing to bet that you can't watch this movie without having a little funPolice Academy (film) - Wikipedia: Police Academy is a 1984 American comedy film directed by Hugh Wilson in his directorial debut, and distributed by Warner Bros..[4] Its storyline follows a new recruitment policy for an unnamed city's police academy to take in any recruit who wishes to apply and study to become a police officer. The film stars Steve Guttenberg, Kim Cattrall, and G. W. Bailey.\n\nThe film was produced by The Ladd Company. It premiered on March 23, 1984.[5] It grossed $8.5 million in its opening weekend and more than $149 million worldwide, against a budget of $4.8 million, and remains the most successful film of the series as of 2022.[3] The film spawned six sequels in the Police Academy franchise, and is the only film in the franchise to be rated R by the MPAA.\n\nIn an unnamed city, the mayor announces that the Metropolitan Police must accept all willing applicants for training, regardless of their suitability for the role. Hundreds of citizens, who never thought they could be police officers, apply: rich girl Karen Thompson; former criminal and human beatbox Larvell Jones; gentle giant Moses Hightower, gun fanatic Eugene Tackleberry; lothario George Martin; soft-spoken Laverne Hooks; accident-prone Douglas Fackler; and bullied Leslie Barbara. Rebellious underachiever, Carey Mahoney, arrested for yet another petty crime, is given a chance to escape prison time by Captain Reed, a friend of his father: enroll in the academy and complete training. Mahoney agrees, planning to misbehave and be forced out, but he learns from Commandant Eric Lassard that he cannot quit or be rejected until training is complete.\n\nDismayed at being forced to take undesirable recruits, Police chief Henry Hurst plots to make the training unbearable so they will willingly quit. Several cadets drop out while training under the ruthless Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris. Harris targets Mahoney, believing his behaviour is preventing him from training actual officers, but when given the chance to quit, Mahoney declines as he and Karen have developed a mutual attraction. Cadets Copeland and Blankes are chosen as squad leaders by Harris to help him torment Mahoney and spy on the other recruits. Copeland and Blankes investigate a party hosted by Mahoney, who uses Barbara to trick them into attending the Blue Oyster Bar, a gay biker bar, where they are intimidated into dancing with the patrons. In revenge, they hide a prostitute in Barbara's dorm room before a room inspection to get him expelled. Mahoney attempts to smuggle her off campus, but they are forced to hide under a lectern just as Lassard leads a presentation to a group of fellow officers. The prostitute covertly performs fellatio on Lassard while he is speaking, and when Lassard later sees Mahoney sneak out, he assumes Mahoney performed the act.\n\nHightower requests Mahoney's help in learning to drive before the cadet driving test. The pair steal Copeland's small, two-door Honda to practice in, evade a police pursuit, and leave it heavily damaged. Following Hightower's successful completion of the test, Copeland racially insults Laverne after she drives over his feet. Enraged, Hightower overturns a police cruiser with Copeland inside it, leading to his ejection from the academy, to the dismay of his fellow cadets. Copeland and Blankes attempt to make Mahoney fight them over Copeland's destroyed car, but he refuses, knowing they are trying to get him thrown out. Barbara stands up for Mahoney and strikes Copeland first, leading to a brawl. Harris threatens to eject Barbara, but Mahoney takes the blame to protect him and is expelled from the academy.\n\nMeanwhile, Fackler throws an apple from his police car during patrol, inadvertently striking a man who mistakenly assumes someone else is responsible, starting a fight which escalates into a city-wide riot. Before he can leave, Mahoney joins the deployed cadets to tackle the disorder, but they find themselves inadvertently transported into the center of the riots and heavily outnumbered. One criminal steals Blankes and Copeland's revolvers and takes Harris hostage on a rooftop. Mahoney tries to help, but the criminal threatens to kill Harris and Mahoney is forced to surrender. Hightower, having followed the chaos, arrives and deceives the criminal into thinking he is on his side, before throwing him down a flight of stairs where he is arrested by Laverne.\n\nAt the cadet graduation ceremony, Mahoney and Hightower have been reinstated to the academy and receive the highest commendations for their bravery. Mahoney prepares to give a speech, but it is revealed that Lassard has hidden the prostitute beneath the Lectern to take revenge on Mahoney.\n\nThe producers considered Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks, and Judge Reinhold for the role of Carey Mahoney.[6] Bruce Willis auditioned for the role of Carey Mahoney.[7]\n\nPaul Maslansky says he got the idea for the film when in San Francisco filming The Right Stuff:\n\nMaslansky said he wondered \"But what if they actually made it?\"[8] He took the idea to Alan Ladd Jr., who agreed to finance.[8] Neal Israel was hired to write the script with Pat Proft. Israel said:\n\nDom DeLuise was considered to direct the film but he was unavailable.[9] Hugh Wilson was hired as director based on his success with WKRP in Cincinnati, even though he was not familiar with many films of this genre. He then saw a lot of those sort. saying \"it was fairly discouraging. This immediately convinced me to cut down on the sleaze. I asked for, and got, the power to refine the Israel-Proft script. Maintaining that 'funny is money,' I wanted to go for real laughter rather than going for the elements such as gratuitous sex and anti-Establishment exploits. I wanted jokes which were rooted in reality.\"[8]\n\nMaslansky says Wilson \"took a lot of the vulgarity out; some of the very things I considered necessary. I worried that it was becoming more homogenized, and I told Hugh, \"Let's keep some of the flatulence in.\"[8]\n\nWilson says \"I found out that the shower scene, the party scene, and the fellatio scene were obligatory; I had to put them in. So I was stuck with trying to make those scenes as artistic as possible.\"[8]\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, about \"20 of the major elements in the movie\" remain from the Israel and Proft version. Israel says that when Wilson and Maslansky turned in their rewrite to the Ladd Company, \"it was rejected and the project was almost shelved. Only when they put back in dozens of our gags did the project get the go ahead.\"[8]\n\nSome of the scenes Wilson was unhappy with included the fellatio scene and the scene where a police sergeant was hurled into the backside of a horse. A compromise was reached where these acts were not actually directly shown.[8]\n\n\"I realize that you can carry grossness, rudeness, and crudeness just so far before the audience finds it terribly repetitive and not so funny,\" said Wilson. \"After the enormous success of Police Academy, I no longer believe that you have to show the female breast or make cruel ethnic jokes, not to mention the rampant sexism. And you don't have to reproduce the sounds that an overfed body makes.\"[8]\n\nOpening scenes were shot in Toronto, Ontario. The camera booth scene was shot on the Cherry Street Bridge in Toronto.[10] The academy itself was previously the site of the Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital in Etobicoke, and has since become the Lakeshore campus of Humber College.[11] The studio scenes were shot at Lakeshore Film Studios; the city scenes were filmed in various parts of Toronto.[12] The riot scenes was filmed at Kensington Market in Toronto. The Silver Dollar Room on Spadina Avenue is the real name of the bar that was filmed for the Blue Oyster Bar scenes.\n• Santa Claus Is Coming to Town - J.

The film went on to gross $81.2 million, becoming the 6th highest-grossing American film of 1984.[15] It grossed $68.6 million overseas for a total worldwide gross of $149.8 million.[3] The film made a profit of $35 million.[3]\n\nPolice Academy received mixed reviews from critics.[16] On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 58% based on 33 reviews, with the critical consensus reading: “Police Academy is rude, crude, and proudly sophomoric – which is either a condemnation or a ringing endorsement, depending on your taste in comedy.”[17] On Metacritic the film has a score of 41 out of 100 based on reviews from 6 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[18]\n\nRoger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, gave the film zero stars out of four, commenting: “It's really something. It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, and chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is”.[19]\n\nCritic Vincent Canby, of The New York Times, gave a mixed review, saying: “The movie plows through one outrageous sequence to the next with the momentum of a freight train”.[20] Rita Kemply, of The Washington Post, wrote: “Attention, all units: Slapstick in progress in the vicinity of Police Academy. Suspects wanted for mugging the camera [...] with the intent to incite a laugh riot. Please respond to this blues burlesque, a uniformly funny hit sure to have a long run.

It ran until November 13, 2020, with a total of eight episodes.[3]\n\nKarl (Paolo Pangilinan), a 19-year old introvert architecture student is in the middle of an identity crisis. Prior to the start of the second semester in college and forced by his parents, he moves into his uncle's condominium unit where he learns to be financially independent.\n\nKarl then takes an online writing job to sustain his daily needs. While expecting the first payout for his work, his client suddenly goes missing in action, thereby making it difficult for him to pay for his monthly dues.\n\nAn opportunity presents itself when his cocky neighbor Vlad (Ian Pangilinan) has to hide from his family and proposes to share Karl's space for the rest of the semestral break in exchange of paying up his monthly rent.[2]\n\nBelow are the cast of the series:[1][4]\n\nIn December 2018, 19-year-old architecture student Karl Frederik Almasen moves into his uncle Santi's former apartment as his parents want him to be independent. He becomes a film-themed freelance writer due to his cinephilia, but struggles to attract clients. One day, his neighbor, Jose Vladimir \"Vlad\" Austria, enters his apartment to hide from his sister Judit; assuming he is a burglar, Karl checks his pants, but Judit opens the door and assumes they are performing fellatio. Vlad then forges his relationship with Karl, stating he will not visit his mother until Judit accepts him. To make him feel comfortable, Vlad promises to Karl that he will help with his rent.

While at his apartment all alone, Karl begins falling in love towards Vlad. The next morning, Karl gives him shelter as he has no place to stay now. It is revealed that Karl is a closeted homosexual, expressing his sexuality through euphemisms, while Vlad is an open one. Karl is hired by a film review website to write search engine optimizations, and Vlad reveals he is in film school. Karl then asks him to be his housemate, saying he wants to transfer to film school as he aspires to do filmmaking. Vlad accepts. End text: Magbahagi tayo ng puwang sa walang mauwian.

Judit apologizes, explaining that Vlad is not used to sharing rooms with other people. Karl then reassures that Vlad also cooks delicious breakfast, and that his passion for film is inspiring. Vlad also explains that he was moody due to rejection from a Japanese film laboratory. Karl accepts, and also apologizes for his attitude. End text: May lugar ka rito. (\"You have a place here.\") As Christmas nears, the Christian Karl decorates his apartment accordingly, but Vlad, whose birthday coincides with Christmas, reveals he does not believe in God though is comfortable with the decoration. While on a call with his friend, it is revealed that Vlad has feelings for Karl. While Karl spends Christmas at his parents' home, Vlad misses him immensely that he dances, imagining him and Karl kissing. The next day, Vlad awakens to the decor theme changed to a birthday one, with Karl back. End text: Kapag may itinuro sa 'yo ang pag-iisa, yakapin mo.

Karl and Vlad decide to spend the night together with neighbor Anna, also Vlad's friend since a teenager. They exploit the dark night by telling urban legends, then move to the gazebo to vent to each other; they learn that they were in Catholic schools. Karl and Vlad, feeling electric, dances and is about to kiss, when the power is back on. The closeted Karl rushes back to his apartment due to anxiety. End text: Habulin ang mga nawalang sandali.

Furious, she takes Vlad away. Karl reveals to his parents he never has passion to architecture, a major his parents always wanted him to go to, infuriating them. After Vlad explains everything to her, Judit apologizes, additionally addressing her past homophobia. Karl pleads Vlad to come back as he misses him; Judit allows. While waiting for Vlad, Karl dances femininely, expressing his sexuality. Amid the dance, Vlad enters and joins Karl, who then kisses him.

Santi talks to Vlad, while Judit can talk to Karl, on whether they are actually in love. Karl, overwhelmed with the discussion, goes to the gazebo and sees a screen playing a home movie of Karl, marking their one-month anniversary. Vlad approaches and they kiss, but Karl sees Anna, Judit, and Santi looking at them. Karl panics on the latter, but Vlad assures him that his uncle sensed his sexuality for a long time. Vlad is hurt on Karl for being in denial when he asks him to say that he is gay, equating his denial to criminals when interrogated. End text: Ikaw ang may pag-aari sa sarili mong katotohanan. (\"You own the rights to your own truth.\") End text:(\"You own the rights to your own truth.\") Vlad moves out of the apartment. Santi assures Karl that it takes time to be an open gay person. The next night, Vlad walks in the apartment drunk. He went to a bar due to stress, where he learned that his ex broke up with him for another man. When Vlad apologizes for forcing him to be open, Karl says \"I'm gay\", and Vlad congratulates him. Karl, however, says he is still not ready to say that in public; Vlad says he can take his time. While cuddling in bed, Karl says he wants to be with him forever. The next day, Anna suggests that he come to terms with his sexuality and spend his time to make the most out of it.

It also aimed on having \"more gay stories told by gay people\" as it advocates for LGBTQ+ media representation. A preview of the series' opening scene was released on Wattpad on April 20, 2020.[5]\n\nIn a tweet from the series' official Twitter account on June 27, 2020, Jaime \"JP\" Habac Jr. was named as its director. Habac is notable for directing I'm Drunk, I Love You, a 2017 romantic comedy independent film.\n\nIts teaser was released on September 4, 2020, on YouTube[6] featuring lead actors Paolo Pangilinan and Ian Pangilinan. The series is Paolo's first acting role while it will be Ian's first lead role on screen.[7]\n\nOn November 13, Globe Studios postponed the release of the finale and e-fan meet to November 20 to gather support for those affected by Typhoon Ulysses.[8]\n\nThe soundtrack of the series is released by the official Globe Studios playlist on Spotify and platforms on Facebook and Youtube[9]\n\nThe teaser was released on September 4, 2020.[14] On September 28, 2020, the official trailer was released on YouTube.[15]\n\nThe first episode, \"Meet Cute\", premiered on YouTube on September 25, 2020, at 8:00 PM (Philippine Standard Time).[16]\n\nThe series was released on Netflix in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan on January 7, 2021.[17][18][19]\n\nThe web series' first episode was released on September 25, 2020.[20] Since then, it has garnered more than 16.3 million total views as of May 22, 2022.\n\nOn being compared with other locally produced boys' love series such as Gameboys[21] and Hello Stranger,[1] Habac dismissed that they were \"competing with any other BL series\" but instead are delighted with its rise as they want to normalize LGBTQIA+ relationships in society by letting the viewers feel that being gay is okay.[22]\n\nYouTube views as of May 22, 2022:\n\nOn November 9, 2020, lead actors Ian Pangilinan and Paolo Pangilinan appeared as guests in \"Mas Testing\", a segment of the noontime variety show It's Showtime. The segment features a \"tumpak tracer\" ( 'accurate tracer') who needs to \"correctly guess which between the two PUT or 'persons under testing' fits a description or does a challenge better.\" However, the questions asked by hosts Vice Ganda, Vhong Navarro and Jhong Hilario drew flak from netizens as the lead actors were asked on who was more straight, \"tigasin\" ( 'tough'), \"magaling magpalabas\" ( 'good in releasing') and \"kulot\" ( 'curly'). This prompted netizens on Twitter to highlight the importance of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression awareness and education.[23][24]\n• The Boy Foretold by the Stars"}

It is usually manufactured as a powder from corn gluten meal. Zein is one of the best understood plant proteins.[1] Pure zein is clear, odorless, tasteless, hard, water-insoluble, and edible, and it has a variety of industrial and food uses.[2][3]\n\nHistorically, zein has been used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric,[4] buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \"Vicara\".[2][5] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.[6][7] It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability.[8]\n\nZein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \"confectioner's glaze\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products[9] or as \"vegetable protein.\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs.[citation needed]\n\nZein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.[10][11] With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.[12][13] Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications.[citation needed]\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.[14] They are also studying medical applications such as using the zein molecule to \"carry biocompounds to targeted sites in the human body\".[15] There are a number of potential food safety applications that may be possible for zein-based packaging according to several researchers. A military contractor is researching the use of zein to protect MRE food packages.[16] Other packaging/food safety applications that have been researched include frozen foods,[17] ready-to-eat chicken,[18] and cheese and liquid eggs.[19] Food researchers in Japan have noted the ability of the zein molecule to act as a water barrier.[20]\n\nWhile there are numerous existing and potential uses for zein, the main barrier to greater commercial success has been its historic high cost until recently. Zein pricing is now very competitive with food shellac. Zein may be extracted as a byproduct in the manufacturing process for ethanol[21] or in new off-shore manufacture.[citation needed]\n\nAlpha-prolamins are the major seed storage proteins of species of the grass tribe Andropogoneae. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication.[22] In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes;[23] twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.[24]ZO® Skin Health | Medical Skin Care: The season of gifting brings about so many questions of what to get for your loved ones.

As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,380.[2] The county seat is Bessemer.[3] Gogebic County is the westernmost county in Michigan, and is one of four Michigan counties within the Central Time Zone. Gogebic County borders Wisconsin to the south, and has a shoreline on Lake Superior to the north.\n\nGogebic County has long been territory of the Lake Superior Chippewa. The Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation is located within Gogebic County.\n\nGogebic County was organized in 1887, partitioned from Ontonagon County. The county's name derives from a lake of the same name, which was originally rendered Agogebic. Sources agree that the name is from Ojibwe, but differ on the original meaning. The county's website suggests it meant \"body of water hanging on high,\"[4] but an 1884 military annal said it meant \"water-mold lake\" (Agogibing).[5] (See also: List of place names of Native American origin in Michigan)\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,476 square miles (3,820 km2), of which 1,102 square miles (2,850 km2) is land and 374 square miles (970 km2) (25%) is water.[6]\n• Lake Gogebic – the largest lake in the Upper Peninsula.\n• Montreal River – forms the county's western border, as well as the state's border with Wisconsin in this area.\n\nThe 2010 United States census indicated Gogebic County had a population of 16,427.[12] This decrease of 943 people from the 2000 United States census was a -5.4% change in population. In 2010, there were 7,037 households and 4,171 families residing in the county. The population density was 15 people per square mile (5.8 people/km2). There were 10,795 housing units at an average density of 10 per square mile (3.9/km2). Among them, 91.7% of the population were White, 4.1% Black or African American, 2.4% Native American, 0.2% Asian, 0.2% of some other race and 1.4% of two or more races. 0.9% were Hispanic or Latino (of any race). 17.4% were of Finnish, 12.8% German, 11.2% American, 10.0% Italian, 6.8% Polish, 6.7% English and 5.1% Irish ancestry.[13]\n\nBy the 2020 census, its population was 14,380.[2] Its population remained predominantly non-Hispanic white, and the largest ancestries as of 2022's American Community Survey were German (16.5%), Italian (13.6%), English (9.5%), and Polish (7.9%).[14]\n\nIn 2010, were 7,037 households, out of which 20.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 45.4% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.7% were non-families. 35.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.11 and the average family size was 2.69. Its county population was 16.9% under the age of 18, 8.4% from 18 to 24, 22.2% from 25 to 44, 31.1% from 45 to 64, and 21.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46.8 years. 53.3% of the population was male, and 46.7% of the population was female.\n\nAs of 2010, the median income for a household in the county was $34,917, and the median income for a family was $47,219. The per capita income for the county was $20,759. About 14.0% of families and 17.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 28.6% of those under age 18 and 9.0% of those age 65 or over.\n\nGogebic is the only known place in the Upper Peninsula to ever host a professional sports team, with Ironwood hosting the Northwest Football League's Gogebic Panthers in 1935[15] and 1936. Their 1935 campaign was immensely successful as the Panthers finished with a 6–1 record, their only loss coming to the eventual league champion La Crosse Old Style Lagers.[16] Their 1936 campaign featured a 6–0 victory over the Madison Cardinals, who folded a few days after the Lagers defeated them 100–0 in an effort to kick them out of the league.[17]\n\nGogebic County was reliably Republican at the beginning of the twentieth century. Roosevelt's New Deal changed the county's mood, which has voted for the Democratic candidate in all but four presidential elections since 1932. In 2016, Donald Trump became the first Republican to win the county since Richard Nixon did in 1972. Trump carried the county again in 2020, despite losing nationally.\n\nThe county is strongly liberal on economic issues and also tends to be somewhat liberal on cultural issues, voting in favor of Michigan Proposal 2 and Michigan Proposal 3, which loosened voter restrictions and codified abortion rights, respectively. Both referendums passed statewide but failed in most counties in the Upper Peninsula. However, the county's heavily unionized electorate is significantly more conservative on other issues, such as affirmative action, as over 70% of Gogebic County residents voted in favor of the Republican-led Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which banned affirmative action.\n\nThe county government operates the jail, maintains rural roads, operates the major local courts, maintains vital records and property records, administers public health regulations, and participates with the state in the provision of welfare and other social services. The county board of commissioners controls the budget and has limited authority to make laws or ordinances. In Michigan, most local government functions — police and fire, building and zoning, tax assessment, street maintenance, etc. — are the responsibility of individual cities and townships.\n• Bus.

The album that followed, Employment, changed our lives and has soundtracked the lives of millions of others since 2005. In 2025 we are saluting 20 years of that album and everyone is invited. Come celebrate the 2000’s, loving everything less & less and stripey blazers taking over the world. See you all next year.Kaiser Chiefs - Wikipedia: Kaiser Chiefs are an English indie rock[1][3] band from Leeds who originally formed in 1996 as Runston Parva, before reforming as Parva in 2000, and releasing one studio album, 22, in 2003, before renaming and establishing themselves in their current name that same year. Since their formation, the band has consisted of lead vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist Andrew \"Whitey\" White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist Nick \"Peanut\" Baines and since 2013 drummer Vijay Mistry, who replaced founding drummer Nick Hodgson following his departure from the band in late 2012.[4]\n\nPrimarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, the band has released eight original studio albums: Employment (2005), Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), Off with Their Heads (2008), The Future Is Medieval (2011), Education, Education, Education & War (2014), Stay Together (2016), Duck (2019), and Kaiser Chiefs' Easy Eighth Album (2024), one EP: Lap of Honour (2005), one compilation album: Souvenir: The Singles 2004–2012 (2012) and numerous singles, including the number one hit song \"Ruby\".\n\nTheir album Employment enjoyed critical and commercial success with over three million copies sold.[5] It has won the band three Brit Awards, including the award for Best British Group,[6] a NME award for Best Album,[7] and was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize.[8][9]\n\nTheir UK hit singles include 2004 and 2005 number 9 hit \"I Predict a Riot\", 2007 UK number 1 hit \"Ruby\", which has sold over 461,000 copies,[10] from their platinum album Yours Truly, Angry Mob plus a further two Top 20 singles in 2007 with \"The Angry Mob\" and \"Everything Is Average Nowadays\". Their singles \"Ruby\", \"I Predict a Riot\", \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\", \"Never Miss a Beat\" and \"Oh My God\" had sold a combined total of 1.1 million up to August 2012.[10]\n\nWhen they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire.[11] After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university.\n\nParva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and without any direction after the release of an album (22) and three singles (\"Heavy\", \"Good Bad Right Wrong\" and \"Hessles\").\n\nAccording to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \"No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them.\"[12] The band decided that they would aim for a longer-term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe.[13]\n\nManager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams, who persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: \"I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles.\" Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band.[12]\n\nIn July 2004, while still relatively unknown inside the UK, Kaiser Chiefs performed their first festival outside the UK at a festival in Moscow.[14] One of the major factors in the band's breakthrough in 2005 was their involvement in the NME Awards Tour at the beginning of the year.[15] Like Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand before them, their position as opening act proved an influential one, attracting a lot of positive media attention.[12]\n\nThe group's debut album Employment was released in March 2005, being primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s.[8] The album was well received by music critics, described as \"thrilling from beginning to end\" and \"quintessentially British, without pretension and most importantly, a whole lot of fun\".[16] It reached number two on the UK albums chart,[17] and was certified five times platinum.[18] In 2005, Employment was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year. Bookmakers made it favourite to win the award, but they eventually lost out to Antony and the Johnsons.[9] In 2006, Employment won the Ivor Novello award for 'Best Album'[19]\n\nThe first single released from the album was \"Oh My God\" in 2004, which reached number six on the UK singles chart when it was reissued in February 2005. In 2007, the song was covered by Mark Ronson and Lily Allen for Ronson's album Version. \"I Predict a Riot\" soon followed as the album's second release. In 2007, the song was ranked number thirty-six on the NME \"Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\" countdown.[20] The top twenty singles \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\" and \"Modern Way\" followed in late 2005. The band opened and performed several of their singles at the Philadelphia Live Eight concert in 2005. The song \"Saturday Night\" was featured in a pre-release video for the Xbox 360 gaming console. It was posted on the official Xbox 360 page before its launch.\n\nIn 2006, the band received NME awards for 'Best Album' for Employment and 'Best Dressed' for Ricky Wilson.[15]\n\nKaiser Chiefs' second album Yours Truly, Angry Mob was released in February 2007. The group recorded the album throughout the September and October 2006 at Hookend Recording Studios in Oxfordshire, England. The group took inspiration from Led Zeppelin and American rock music, and recorded over twenty-two songs.[21]\n\nYours Truly, Angry Mob reached number one on the UK albums chart and number forty-five on the Billboard 200 albums chart.[22] The album went on to be the band's second Million Seller including the UK and European #1 Airplay Hit of 2007 \"Ruby\".[23]\n\n\"Ruby\", the album's lead single, became Kaiser Chiefs' first UK number one single[24] and received the 2007 'Q Award' for 'Best Video'.[25] \"Everything Is Average Nowadays\" was released as the album's second single, and reached No. 19 in the UK.[26] The album's third single \"The Angry Mob\" peaked at number twenty-two in the UK.[27][28] The fourth single, \"Love's Not a Competition (But I'm Winning)\", was released on 12 November as a collector's edition 7\" only single via their website.\n\nIn December 2007, Kaiser Chiefs played two sold-out shows at Earl's Court in London[29] to a capacity crowd of 30,000.[30]\n\nOn 4 August 2008, the band confirmed the name of their third album as Off with Their Heads. It was released on 20 October 2008. The first single \"Never Miss a Beat\" was released on 6 October 2008.[31]\n\nThe band also released a DVD of their live performance at Elland Road from 24 May where they played to a sold out capacity crowd of 40,000 people.[32] The DVD contains the full set from the home of Leeds United as well as highlights from the Kaiser Chiefs performance for the 2007 BBC Electric Proms.\n\nKaiser Chiefs set out on a UK tour in October 2008 with Castle Donington band Late of the Pier and The Hair. The tour started at Leeds Academy, a new venue where they were the first headlining band to play. Other dates included Manchester Academy, Southampton Guildhall, Reading Rivermead, Glasgow Barrowlands, Leicester De Montfort Hall and London Forum.[citation needed]\n\nKaiser Chiefs headed out on a UK Arena tour between February and March 2009, kicking off in Nottingham and ending in London. The tour visited Sheffield, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Dublin. This was the new album tour to promote Off with Their Heads. The band featured on several shows over Christmas 2008 including performing \"Never Miss a Beat\" with Girls Aloud on their TV Special and playing the same song on the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops.\n\nOn 16 July 2009, they played at Marés Vivas in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal as headliners on that day. They, along with Republic of Loose, opened for U2 in Croke Park in Dublin on 25 July 2009. They then opened for Green Day from 27 July to 7 August 2009, and the final shows before their 2-year hiatus were performed at Reading and Leeds Festival 2009.[33]\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Kaiser Chiefs announced that they expected to release their fourth studio album in mid-2011. The album was recorded over a period of eighteen months at various locations including drummer Nick Hodgson's self-built east-London studio.[34] The album's producers included Tony Visconti, Ethan Johns and Owen Morris, in addition to Nick Hodgson himself.[35] On 3 June 2011, Kaiser Chiefs launched their new album from their website. Using a create-your-own album technique, fans were able to choose 10 out of 20 songs to create \"their album\" for £7.50; the band provides streams of roughly one minute to preview each track before selection. Many celebrities including, Radio One DJ Chris Moyles, The Guardian Newspaper, and frontman Ricky Wilson, created their own version of the album, donating the £1 reimbursement for each copy sold to the Alzheimer's Society.[36]\n\nOn 27 June 2011, Kaiser Chiefs released an official track listing for the album, featuring 12 of the 20 available tracks and including a previously unheard track 'Kinda Girl You Are' which did not make the initial launch as it was not ready in time.[37] They played two sell out comeback gigs at Falmouth Princess Pavilion. Then followed by appearances at Germany's Hurricane and Southside Festivals in June, Switzerland's Gurten Festival, Pinkpop in The Netherlands, Belgium's Rock Werchter, Portuguese festival Optimus Alive! in July, V Festival in August, Hard Rock Calling in June, the Isle of Wight Festival in June and at Terres Rouges Festival in Luxembourg in September. They also played at Tennants Vital in Bangor, Northern Ireland and in September they played two sold-out home town shows at Kirkstall Abbey in Leeds. They also be played in October in Festa das Latas, Coimbra – Portugal.\n\nOn 6 March 2012 the album was re-released under the title Start The Revolution Without Me for the US market. The track list differs significantly from the initial release, including the track \"On The Run\", which is exclusive to the US album and served as its lead single in early 2012.[38]\n\nIn early 2012, Kaiser Chiefs played a 20 date tour of the United Kingdom, followed by a tour of North America.[38][39]\n\nKaiser Chiefs released their first compilation album, Souvenir: The Singles 2004–2012, in the UK on 4 June 2012. The album features all of the singles released by the band from 2004 to 2012, as well as a new track titled \"Listen to Your Head\".\n\nDrummer Nick Hodgson announced on 4 December 2012 that he had left the band to concentrate on other projects.[4][40] The band later issued a statement on their website confirming this.[41] On 7 February 2013 it was announced that Vijay Mistry from the band Club Smith would be joining the Kaiser Chiefs as their new drummer.[42]\n\nThe band were one of two support bands for Green Day's one-off concert at the Emirates Stadium in London on 1 June 2013 along with All Time Low. The band's UK tour included 13 shows, beginning at Carlisle Sands Centre on 11 February and ending at London's O2 Academy Brixton on 1 March. The run of shows also includes gigs in Glasgow, Dunfermline, Manchester, Bridlington, Newcastle, Preston, Cheltenham, Wolverhampton, Southampton, Margate and Cambridge. They then went on to headline one of the Eden Sessions at the Eden Project, Cornwall. They played a hometown concert at the First Direct Arena in September 2013, being one of the first artists to perform at the new venue.[43]\n\nThe band's fifth studio album, titled Education, Education, Education & War was released on 31 March 2014.[44] Education, Education, Education & War is the first album featuring the new Kaiser Chiefs drummer, Vijay Mistry, after Nick Hodgson left the group in December 2012.[45] The album was produced by Ben H. Allen III (who has previously worked with Gnarls Barkley, Animal Collective, and Deerhunter), and recorded at The Maze Studio in Atlanta. Three songs were co-written with Fraser T Smith (CeeLo Green, Adele).[46][47] It was mixed by Michael Brauer (My Morning Jacket, Coldplay) at Electric Lady Studios in New York City in November 2013.[48] On 5 December 2013, Kaiser Chiefs released a song titled \"Misery Company\" onto their SoundCloud account. The song had previously been performed live during the band's 2013 summer tour.[45][49] On 3 January 2014, \"Bows & Arrows\" premiered on Rolling Stone magazine's website.\n\nEducation, Education, Education & War was toured across Europe and the Americas throughout 2014 and 2015.\n\nIn 2015, they supported the Foo Fighters during the South Africa, South America and Ireland legs of their Sonic Highways World Tour. They also released stand alone single 'Falling Awake' on 27 January 2015 via their YouTube channel.\n\nStay Together, the band's sixth studio album, was released on 7 October 2016. It was co-written and produced by Brian Higgins, whose production company Xenomania has worked with the likes of Girls Aloud and Pet Shop Boys. The album's name is a reference to the song \"We Stay Together\".[50][51] The first single from the album, \"Parachute\", was released on 14 June 2016. The second single, \"Hole In My Soul\" was released 18 August 2016 and the third and final single, \"We Stay Together\" was released on 9 December 2016.\n\nThis welcome return to the limelight saw ‘Stay Together’ push new boundaries to \"take this nondescript sound and stuff it impressively full of sing-a-long hooks, covering topics including monogamy (We Stay Together) and shagging (Good Clean Fun)\" as it marked an entirely new direction for the band, who went for a more dance-oriented sound.[52] While Education, Education, Education and War was more focused on politics and the perils of war, the Kaiser Chiefs made the album with a focus on love and relationships. Wilson elaborated further on the stark contrast between this last album and 'Stay Together': \"The thing about writing a protest album is it's straightforward. Only an idiot would disagree with you. You're just saying war is bad. But when you start talking about relationships like on this record it's harder because there's a lot more blurred line. There's no right or wrong.\"[53]\n\nThe band performed a string of best of forest shows in the summer of 2016 as part the Forestry Commission's Forest Live series. Stay Together was toured across Europe in early 2017.\n\nThe band signed with their original label Polydor Records for their seventh studio album, Duck, which released on 26 July 2019. For the album the band reunited with Ben H. Allen, the producer who worked on the band's 2014 album Education, Education, Education & War. The album was preceded by a UK tour in January and February, including concerts at London's O2 Academy Brixton and O2 Academy Birmingham, where several new songs from the album were premiered. The band also played a homecoming show at Elland Road in Leeds on 8 June 2019, which was also to celebrate 100 years of Leeds United.[54]\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Record Collection\", was released on 23 May 2019, with \"People Know How To Love One Another\" released as a second single on 6 June 2019. \"Golden Oldies\" was released as the third single in October 2019. The album entered at number three in the UK album charts.[55] Duck was later toured around arenas in the UK and Europe in early 2020, with all further touring cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn October 2022, the band announced the single \"How 2 Dance\", the first for V2 Records, which was released on 4 November. The song is part of their eighth album, Kaiser Chiefs' Easy Eighth Album,[56] produced by Nile Rodgers and Amir Amor.[57] The second single, \"Jealousy\", was released on 11 April 2023.[58] The third single, \"Feeling Alright\", was released on 25 October 2023.[59] The album was released on March 1, 2024.\n\nIn July 2005 they were chosen to open Bob Geldof's Live 8 festival in Philadelphia; their performance was broadcast by satellite to every Live 8 venue around the world, giving the band massive worldwide exposure.\n\nIn August 2006, the band released a book entitled A Record of Employment, which along with photos by Peter Hill, documented the band's rise from being unsigned to their triumph at the Brit Awards that year, where the band won awards for 'Best British Band', 'Best Rock Act' and 'Best New Artist'. Later a DVD entitled Enjoyment, which documented concerts from the first album era was released, this showed members of the band hypothetically interviewed when 'jaded rock stars'.\n\nIn October 2008, they also appeared on MTV Day, in Greece, along with bands like the (Greek) C-Real, R.E.M. and the singer Gabriella Cilmi.[60]\n\nDuring an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman, David Letterman spoke to Nick Hodgson about buying the Kaiser Chiefs drum set after a brief discussion between the pair an undisclosed price was agreed. At the end of the Kaiser Chiefs show at Chicago's House of Blues (19 April 2012) Nick Hodgson announced this was the final show for his drum kit, which was to be sent to David Letterman.\n\nOn 12 August 2012, the band was featured in the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, playing \"Pinball Wizard\" by The Who.\n\nIn October 2014, Kaiser Chiefs played at The New Adelphi Club in Hull, East Yorkshire as headline act for the venue's 30th anniversary celebration.[61] A film capturing Kaiser Chiefs performance was made, which was shown at the Adelphi in January 2015 as part of Independent Music Venue Week. In October 2015, the film was screened at the 2015 Tucson Film & Music Festival in Arizona, United States.[62]\n\nThe band were the closing act for F1 Live (an event showcasing Formula 1 ahead of the 2017 British Grand Prix) held in Trafalgar Square, London on 12 July 2017, which was also broadcast live on Sky Sports.\n\nIn September 2022, Kaiser Chiefs headlined Pub in The Park in St Albans.[63]\n• Off with Their Heads (2008)\n• Off With Their Heads Tour (2008-2009)Kaiser Chiefs: Almost two decades in the game, and an extensive back-catalogue of stadium belters, instrumental-prowess, and record-breaking success, Kaiser Chiefs triumphantly return. Right off the back of a storm of note-worthy live-performances (including the Invictus Games opening ceremony, headlining Virgin Radio’s: One Big Thank You key worker show, and a televised performance for ITV’s Queen’s Jubilee celebrations), Kaiser Chiefs release their latest single: ‘How 2 Dance; the first taste of their forthcoming new album which promises to not only see us through the end of this year, but launch fans into 2023 with impeccable swagger, and heritage songwriting. “We really wanted to make a song that put together all the things we were trying to get right over the last three records”, notes frontman Ricky Wilson. “The call to arms of ‘Education, Education, Education and War’ (2014), the party atmosphere of ‘Stay Together’ (2016), and the classic Kaiser-yness of ‘Duck’. Where 2019’s ‘Duck’ straddled the tide between Northern-Soul euphoria and early ‘00s antithesis (in a statement of melancholic perfection), 2022 see’s Kaiser Chiefs stepping into a renewed spotlight; a hook-heightened universe in which Wilson (vocals), Andrew “Whitey” White (guitar), Simon Rix (bass), Keyboardist Peanut and Vijay Mistry on drums, come together to once again create what they craft best; breakthrough belters for the world’s dancefloor.Kaiser Chiefs - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Kaiser Chiefs es una banda indie rock[1]​[2]​ británica de Leeds, West Yorkshire (Inglaterra, Reino Unido), formada por Ricky Wilson (vocalista), Andrew 'Whitey' White (guitarra), Simon Rix (bajo), Nick 'Peanut' Baines (sintetizador, teclado) y Vijay Mistry (batería).\n\nEl álbum debut de la banda, Employment, fue lanzado en 2005 y muestra influencias del new wave y el rock punk de los años 1970. El álbum obtuvo un gran éxito internacional, con tres millones de copias vendidas. El rápido ascenso del quinteto a la escena internacional musical a principios de 2005 tuvo su momento culminante cuando abrieron el concierto Live Aid de Filadelfia. En 2007, sacaron a la venta su segundo álbum, Yours Truly, Angry Mob, cuyo primer sencillo Ruby llegó a ser número uno en el Reino Unido.\n\nEl 13 de octubre de 2008 lanzaron su tercer disco, Off with Their Heads. Su cuarto disco, The Future is Medieval, fue publicado sin previo aviso el 3 de junio de 2011, mientras que su quinto disco fue lanzado el 31 de marzo de 2014 Education, Education, Education & War, su sexto álbum Stay Together el 7 de octubre de 2016, y su séptimo álbum Duck, el 26 de julio de 2019.\n\nTres de los miembros de la banda, Nick Hodgson, Nick 'Peanut' Baines, y Simon Rix, se conocieron en clase en el St Mary's School de las afueras de Leeds cuando tenían once años. Tras dejar el colegio, Rix y Baines fueron a la universidad en 1996. Mientras, Hodgson conoció en Leeds a Andre 'Whitey' White y Ricky Wilson, juntos dieron los primeros pasos como banda llamándose Runston Parva de estilo garage rock. Con el regreso de Rix y Baines, se unieron a la banda, renombrada como Parva con la que intentaron lanzar un disco, idea que no tuvo mucho éxito. Para poder mantener un contrato importante con una discográfica comenzaron a componer nuevas canciones con un nuevo nombre: Kaiser Chiefs, el cual fue derivado de su afición por el Leeds United, ya que una de las máximas estrellas del club de fútbol, el sudafricano Lucas Radebe[3]​ tuvo su origen en el equipo de fútbol sudafricano Kaizer Chiefs.\n\nEl álbum debut de los Kaiser Chiefs fue sacado al público en marzo de 2005, inspirado en el sonido del new wave y del punk rock de los años 1970, quedó tercero en las listas de esa semana y recibió muy buenas críticas que lo describieron como ‘emocionante desde el principio hasta el final’ o ‘prototípico británico, sin pretensión y lo más importante, muy divertido’. Quedó número 2 en las listas de álbumes del Reino Unido y aunque fue como favorito, no logró el Mercury Prize (premio anual para la mejor banda británica e irlandesa del anterior año).\n\nEl primer sencillo, lanzado anteriormente en 2004, fue \"Oh My God\" quedando sexto en el Reino Unido. El segundo sencillo fue \"I Predict A Riot\" que en 2007 llegó a la posición treinta y seis en el ranking de NME. En 2005, ganaron el Philip Hall Radar Award y abrieron las actuaciones del Live 8 de Filadelfia. Fueron teloneros de la banda irlandesa U2 en varios conciertos de su gira Vertigo 2005, como en los celebrados en España.\n\nUn DVD, titulado Employment fue lanzado en noviembre de 2005. El DVD es un documental sobre la banda, narrado por Bill Nightly. También incluye todos los videos promocionales y presentaciones en vivo.\n\nUn video musical -hasta ahora mostrado exclusivamente en Internet- para su canción \"Sink that Ship\" fue lanzado en septiembre de 2005. El video aparece en el sitio web de Electronic Arts como una herramienta de promoción para su juego Burnout Revenge, pero aparece sin créditos.\n\nEl segundo álbum de Kaiser Chiefs fue lanzado en febrero de 2007. La banda grabó este álbum durante septiembre y octubre de 2006 en el Hook End Studio en Oxfordshire (Inglaterra) inspirado en Led Zeppelin y la música rock americana. A diferencia de Employment, el álbum recibió tanto buenas como malas críticas, algunas describiéndolo como ‘predecible’. A pesar de ello alcanzó el número uno de las listas británicas.\n\nLa canción \"Ruby\" se convirtió en el primer número uno de la banda. Tanto la letra como el estilo de la canción fue relacionado con la canción \"Lyla\" de Oasis.\n\nEl 13 de octubre salió a la venta el nuevo disco de la banda anglosajona, con los sencillos: \"Never Miss a Beat\" y \"Good Days Bad Days\".\n\nSu cuarto disco lo sacaron el 3 de junio de 2011. El disco fue lanzado sin previo aviso en su web, y la forma de adquirirlo fue novedosa. Se podía personalizar la portada del disco y escoger 10 canciones de las 20 que había para elegir. Su precio fue de 7,50 libras (unos 8 euros y medio).\n\nLas canciones entre las que los seguidores podían elegir eran 'Back In December', 'Can't Mind My Own Business', 'Child Of The Jago', 'Coming Up For Air', 'Cousin In The Bronx', 'Dead Or In Serious Trouble', 'Fly On The Wall', 'Heard It Break', 'I Dare You', 'If You Will Have Me', 'Little Shocks', 'Long Way From Celebrating', 'Man On Mars', 'My Place Is Here', 'Out Of Focus', 'Problem Solved', 'Saying Something', 'Starts With Nothing' y 'Things Change'. Más tarde, debido al parloteo que se hacía sobre esta novedosa herramienta de comprar el álbum y a la demanda de que se lanzara un \"álbum oficial\", ahora está disponible el CD de \"The Future Is Medieval\", que contiene las siguientes canciones: 'Little Shocks', 'Things Change', 'Long Way From Celebrating', 'Starts With Nothing', 'Out Of Focus', 'Dead Or In Serious Trouble', 'When All Is Quiet', 'Kinda Girl You Are', 'Man On Mars', 'Child Of The Jago', 'Heard It Break', 'Coming Up For Air' y 'If You Will Have Me', además la última canción trae un tema escondido, ‘Howlaround’, mismo que se vendió como canción individual en iTunes. También cabe mencionar que 'Kinda Girl You Are' no está incluida en la versión de iTunes, aunque dicha versión contiene la canción 'City'. Tanto el CD como el álbum digital de iTunes salieron a la venta el 27 de junio de 2011.\n\nEl 4 de diciembre de 2012 el baterista de Kaiser Chiefs, Nick Hodgson comunicó a través de su cuenta de Twitter que dejaba el grupo, después de quince maravillosos.\n\nEl quinto disco de la banda de Leeds fue lanzado el 31 de marzo de 2014 bajo el sello discográfico Fiction Records, B-Unique Records, Caroline Records and ATO Records. El disco fue producido por Ben H. Allen III. El 7 de octubre de octubre de 2016 la banda publicó su sexto álbum, Stay Together, con la producción de Brian Higgins. El primer sencillo del álbum fue ‘Parachute’, seguido de ‘Hole In My Soul’ y ‘We Stay Together’, todos publicados entre junio y diciembre de 2016.\n\nLa banda firmó con la compañía Polydor Records para su séptimo álbum de estudio, llamado Duck, que salió al mercado el 26 de julio de 2019. Para este disco la banda se volvió a juntar con el productor Ben H. Allen. El primer sencillo del disco fue ‘Record Collection’, al que siguieron ‘People Know How To Love One Another’ y ‘Golden Oldies’.\n\nEl 4 de noviembre de 2022 la banda publí�có el sencillo ‘How 2 Dance’.\n\nEl primer concierto de alto nivel en un festival de Kaiser Chiefs fue en el doble Reading and Leeds Festival, el 27 de agosto del 2004. El siguiente año, el 16 de mayo del 2005, aparecieron en el Festival Pinkpop en Landgraaf, Holanda. Posteriormente, las cosas aceleraron vertiginosamente. Fueron el acto de apertura del concierto Live 8 de Filadelfia el 2 de julio de 2005, uno de los dos únicos actos británicos en el line-up (Def Leppard fue el otro). Tocaron \"I Predict a Riot\", \"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\" y \"Oh My God\".\n\nEn junio de 2005 tuvieron una presentación en el Baile de Mayo de Queen's College, en Cambridge, antes de una aclamada presentación en el Festival Glastonbury bajo lluvia torrencial, el mismo mes. Su aparición de agosto en el V Festival mostró a una banda muy entusiasmada, a pesar de que Ricky Wilson tenía una pierna enyesada. Más recientemente, embarcaron en su propio tour por el Reino Unido, con el apoyo de Maxïmo Park y The Cribs. El grupo también ha recibido mucha atención por unas cuantas presentaciones en el tour de Foozer. Esto fue aunado a ser el acto apertura para Foo Fighters durante su tour australiano en diciembre de 2005. El 3 de noviembre de 2008 se presentan en Chile en el SUE (Santiago Urbano Electrónico) festival. En el 2009 y junto a Franz Ferdinand, son teloneros de la gira estadounidense de Green Day, tocando en ciudades como Miami y Orlando.\n\nEl 13 de agosto de 2012 fue la ceremonia de clausura de los Juegos Olímpicos de Londres 2012 y Kaiser Chiefs participaron. Ricky Wilson entró al estadio montado en una motocicleta Mod rodeado de otras motos. En ella dio una vuelta en el estadio entonando la canción \"Pinball Wizard\" de The Who para luego unirse al resto de los integrantes de la banda en el estadio donde siguieron con la canción.\n\nHan dado sonido a la entrada de algunos videojuegos importantes como Pro Evolution Soccer 2008, Pro Evolution Soccer 2009 y Pro Evolution Soccer 2010, de Konami, con las canciones \"Thank You Very Much\", \"Never Miss A Beat\" y \"Ruby\" respectivamente. Además, su canción \"I Predict a Riot\" está incluida en la banda sonora de Gran Turismo 4, al igual que en una de las versiones del juego SingStar. La canción \"Ruby\" fue incluida en el videojuego Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock y en Lego Rock Band, también está incluida en la banda sonora del videojuego Project Gotham Racing 4. Adicional la canción \"Never Miss A Beat\" aparece en el videojuego Guitar Hero 5."}

He was the eldest son of Shapur I ( 240–270) and succeeded his brother Hormizd I ( 270–271), who had reigned for a year.\n\nBahram I's reign marked the end of the Sasanian tolerance towards Manichaeism, and in 274, with the support of the influential Zoroastrian priest Kartir, he had Mani imprisoned and executed. Bahram I's reign was brief and largely uneventful. He was succeeded by his son Bahram II.\n\nThe theophoric name \"Bahram\" (بهرام یکم) is the New Persian form of the Middle Persian Warahrān (also spelled Wahrām), which is derived from the Old Iranian Vṛθragna. The Avestan equivalent was Verethragna, the name of the old Iranian god of victory, whilst the Parthian version was *Warθagn. The name is transliterated in Greek as Baranes, whilst the Armenian transliteration is Vahagn/Vrām. The name is attested in Georgian as Baram and Latin as Vararanes.\n\nBahram I was the oldest son of Shapur I, the second shah of the Sasanian Empire. He had three younger brothers: Hormizd-Ardashir, Narseh, and Shapur Meshanshah. Although the oldest of Shapur's sons, Bahram I was ranked below his brothers, probably due to his mother's lowly origin: she was either a minor queen or a concubine. During Shapur's reign, Bahram I served as the governor of the newly conquered region of Gilan, situated on the southwest shore of the Caspian Sea. He held the title of Gelan Shah (\"king of Gilan\"). He is mentioned in an inscription on the wall of the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht at Naqsh-e Rostam near Persepolis in southern Iran, which Shapur I had created in order to praise his sons by citing their names and titles.\n\nShapur I died in 270, and was succeeded by Hormizd-Ardashir (who became known as Hormizd I), who ruled from May 270 until his death in June 271. Bahram I, who was never considered a candidate for succession of the throne by his father, ascended with the aid of the powerful Zoroastrian priest Kartir. He then made a settlement with Narseh, who agreed to give up his entitlement to the throne in return for the governorship of the important frontier province of Armenia, which was constantly the source of war between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. It is nevertheless likely that despite this settlement, Narseh still viewed Bahram as a usurper.\n\nThe previous Sasanian shahs, including Shapur I, had pursued a policy of religious tolerance towards the non-Zoroastrian minorities in the empire. Although admiring the teachings of his own religion and encouraging the Zoroastrian clergy, Shapur I allowed the Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus to freely practice their own religions. He was also friendly towards Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, who was allowed to preach freely and even act as an escort in Shapur's military expeditions. Following Bahram I's accession to the throne, the rise of the authority of the Zoroastrian priesthood, and the increasing influence of Kartir, this changed. When Mani arrived at the city of Gundishapur there was uproar, in the same fashion as Jesus' entry into Jerusalem. After protests from Kartir and the other Zoroastrian priests, Bahram I was persuaded to imprison Mani, who was sentenced to death in 274.\n\nMani's death was followed by the persecution of his followers by Kartir and the Zoroastrian clergy, who moved against the kingdom's religious minorities as a way to increase and spread their influence. To the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani had been seen as a heterogeneous philosopher and a threatening pagan, who presented an obscure perception of Zoroastrianism that was tainted by Jewish, Buddhist, and Christian ideas. With the backing of Bahram I, Kartir laid the foundations for a Zoroastrian state church, which led to Bahram being applauded in Sasanian-based sources as a \"benevolent and worthy king\". Bahram I was nevertheless, like his predecessors, a \"lukewarm Zoroastrian\".\n\nBahram I died in September 274 and was succeeded by his son Bahram II. Another son of Bahram I, Hormizd I Kushanshah, ruled over the Kushano-Sasanian kingdom in the east, and would later lead a rebellion against Bahram II, which failed. The line of Bahram I continued to rule the Sasanian Empire until 293, when Narseh overthrew the latter's grandson Bahram III and proclaimed himself the new shah. The line was thus shifted to Narseh and his descendants, who continued to rule the empire until its fall in 651.\n\nUnder Bahram I, the reverse of coins were changed back to the version minted during the reign of Shapur I, with two attendants turning their backs to the fire altar, instead of facing it. The front of Bahram I's coins shows him wearing the distinctive crown of the angelic divinity Mithra; a headgear decorated with ray-shaped spikes. A coin of Bahram was seemingly minted at Balkh in Bactria, which makes it the first imperial Sasanian coin (i.e. not Kushano-Sasanian) minted in the former domains of the Kushan Empire, and confirms direct Sasanian rule in the region under Bahram I. The lost Book of the Portraits of Sasanian Kings portrayed Bahram I as \"standing, holding a lance in the right hand and leaning upon a sword held in the left, and wearing a red gown and trousers and a gold crown topped with a sky-blue globe\".\n\nBahram I was keen on combat, hunting and feasting, which he regarded as righteousness.\n\nFollowing the precedent of Ardashir I and Shapur I, Bahram I had an image of his accession carved in a rock relief. It displayed him on horseback, accepting the diadem of kingship from the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda, who is also depicted sitting on a horse. A Middle Persian inscription is written on the relief. According to the archaeologist Erich Schmidt, the relief is \"artistically the most appealing example of Sasanian rock sculpture\". When Narseh ascended the throne in 293, he had the rock relief altered, replacing Bahram's name with his own.\n• None Daryaee, Touraj (2009). Sasanian Persia: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.

His succession to his brother Hormizd I strengthened the position of the Zoroastrian clergy and their high priest Kartēr, and at their insistence Bahrām imprisoned Mani, the founder of the antimaterialist, ascetic religion of Manichaeism. Subsequent religious persecution was directed not only at Manichaeans but at Christians and Buddhists as well. Bahrām, distinguished by his characteristic radiate crown, is portrayed on a rock sculpture at Bishāpūr (in southern Iran), although his name in the inscription was later erased by the Sāsānian king Narses.Bahram I - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: Bahram I (¿-276) en persa: بهرام یکم‎, fue rey del Imperio sasánida.

Nada más se sabe de su reinado.\n\nEl nombre Bahram procede de Varahrän, la forma más reciente de Verethragna, el nombre del dios persa antiguo de la victoria y \"el que mató al dragón Verethra\".

There are five localities of about equal size and population located on the island: Izena, Nakada, Shomi, Uchihana, and Jicchaku (also called Serikyaku).\n\nIzena's primary claim to fame is that it was the birthplace of King Shō En, the first king of the Second Shō Dynasty. It is also the birthplace of the contemporary artist Naka Bokunen and musician Shunichi Irei [ja] (伊禮 俊一 Irei Shun'ichi).\n\nAs of 1 October 2020, the island has an estimated population of 1,322 and a density of 86 persons per square kilometer. The total area is 15.42 km2 (5.95 sq mi).\n\nThe island's topography features a row of mountains spanning from the northwest to the southeast of the island, with generally flat, arable land covering the remainder. The island has several sandy beaches and designated camping areas with bathroom facilities. The view of Izena's rocky southern coastline is well known as one of Japan's best, with the rock formations 'Umi Gitara' and 'Agi Gitara' dramatically rising from the land and sea.\n\nIzena's main crops are sugar and the edible seaweed mozuku, but there are also several rice paddies, livestock farms, and a cattle breeding facility. From December through April, sugar is harvested and processed at a refinery on the island before being exported. There is an awamori distillery in Izena Village that produces several varieties of the beverage.\n\nCommerce on the island is limited to a small grocery store, gas station, farmer's market, and building supply store that are operated by Japan's Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives, several other independently owned convenience stores, restaurants, and bars in each of the island's 5 villages, and several hotels along the beach and in the island's center. There is a scuba diving shop in Nakada Village open in the summer that provides equipment and tours.\n\nIzena is one of only a handful of places in Okinawa that was not ravaged by American and Japanese military forces during World War II, although American bombing on the nearby island of Iheya resulted in approximately 50 civilian deaths. When American Marines landed on Izena during the night of June 23, 1945, they encountered no hostile defenses or enemy combatants and left shortly thereafter.[citation needed]\n• Copy of “Ordinance relating to the Shipwreck Rescue off the coast of Dana” (田名沖における難破船救助に関する言上写) (Municipal)\n\nThe island is accessible by a ferry that makes two daily round trips between Nakada Port and Unten Port in Nakijin Village, which is located North of Nago on Okinawa's main island. The ferry trip takes approximately one hour. Izena also has an airfield, though daily service to the island by airplane was halted in 2007.\n\nThere are a kindergarten, junior high school and elementary school, all located near the center of the island and serving all five villages. As of 2010, the average size of each grade is 20 students.\n\nOkinawa Prefectural Board of Education operates senior high schools elsewhere in the prefecture.\n\nAfter graduating from junior high school, students must move to mainland Okinawa if they wish to attend high school. In the sense that they no longer live together, the island's youth become independent from their parents at 15 years old.[citation needed]\n\nIzena Island hosts an annual triathlon, the Izena 88 (2 km swim + 66 km bike + 20 km run) in the Autumn, participation of which (in 2007) was numbered at around 830. There is also a kids' triathlon for island residents on the day preceding the main race.Izena Island - Wikipedia: Izena Island (Okinawan: イジナ, romanized: Ijina) (Japanese: 伊是名島 Izena-jima) is located in the East China Sea, north-west of Okinawa Island, in the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. The island has a diameter of about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) and is surrounded by coral reefs, blue sea, and white beaches. It is administered as Izena Village. The five settlements of about equal size and population which are located on the island are Izena, Nakada, Shomi, Uchihana, and Jicchaku (also called Serikyaku).[1]\n\nIzena village was the birthplace of King Shō En (1415–1476), the first king of the Second Shō dynasty of the Ryūkyū Kingdom.[2][3][4] Shō Shishō (1402–1439), of the short lived First Shō dynasty, was also from Izena Island. The worshiping rites of Agari Umai (“worship from afar”) and the ritual of welcoming of sea deities are observed in this island.[5] Izena Island is also the birthplace of the contemporary artist Naka Bokunen and musician Irei Shunichi (伊禮俊一).[1]\n\nThe island is also associated with the pottery and archaeological ruins found here of the Okinawa's pre-historic Jōmon period (c. 14,000 BC – c. 300 BC).[4] The island has historic sites such as Izena Tamaudun Mausoleum,[6] Izena Castle, a historical fortress built around in the 14th century, and a park which has bronze statue of King Shō En when he was known as Uchima Kanemaru (内間金丸).\n\nIzena Island lies in the East China Sea, to the northwest of Okinawa Island, and southeast of Iheya Island.[7] Noho Island lies off of Iheya Island's southern tip. Gushikawa Island and Cape Agarizaki lies between Iheya Island and Izena Island. Izena and Iheya are separated only by a narrow strait; the landscape of the two islands is alike with sugarcane fields and cattle farms.\n\nThe total area is 15.44 square kilometres (5.96 sq mi), and the peripheral sea coast line is 16 kilometres (9.9 mi).[8][9][10] The island's topography features a series of mountains spanning from the northwest to the southeast of the island, with generally flat, arable land covering the remainder. The island has several white sandy beaches. Coral reefs form a lagoon or lake and are natural breakwaters. Izena's rocky southern coastline has rock formations such as 'Umi Gitara' and 'Agi Gitara', dramatically rising from the land and sea.[2][3][4][10]\n\nThe island's settlement history goes back at least 3000 years. Archeological excavations have revealed many artifacts in the form of axes and knives made of stone and also pottery and human bones. The earliest recorded history is of five lineages lasting over 692 years in the period 1187 to 1879. The Second Shō dynasty ruled between 1470 and 1879, with the first king, Shō En, born on this island. Artifacts related to the period of this dynasty are seen in the village of Izena.[9] King Shō En not only applied for “recognition and investiture to enhance the prestige and authority of his family among his countrymen” but had also built an elegant tomb on a small hill and consecrated the remains of his parents; his sister was appointed the chief Noro in Iheya. Sho En showed great reverence to his father and to the predecessors belonging to the royalty of the First Shō dynasty, whom he had replaced with the Shō Second dynasty.[13] After the Battle of Okinawa and subsequent to liberation day after World War II, two Americans were beheaded on Izena Island.[14] USS Bush and USS Drexler were sunk by kamikaze aircraft to the northwest of the island on 6 April 1945 and 28 May 1945 respectively.\n\nThe island's main economic activity is centered around agricultural farming, fisheries and commerce. In 2003, Izena village was declared a \"Tourism Village\".[9] Naka Bokunen, a well known woodblock artist of the village, also knowledgeable about its history and culture, has been assigned as a Tourism Ambassador and given the task of promoting tourism on the island. To promote environmental concerns and tourism, a tax called the “Izena Village Environmental Cooperation Tax”, a levy of 100 yen for every entry to the island, was introduced in 2005.[9][10] Mozuke, a type of sea weed, is a major export; its production ranks third in Okinawa prefecture. It is harvested after a growth period of six months. The economy of the people is also sustained by tokobushi, a type of abalone; the process is being improved to offer a better yield.[9][10] The total annual income of the villagers is reported to be 3.47 billion yen, giving a per capita income of 1.78 million yen per person, which is about the same as for the Okinawa Island.[9]\n\nThree most prominent monuments on the island are: Izena Tamaudun Mausoleum,[6] the historical fortress of Izena Castle, and a park which has a bronze statue of King Shō En. Izena Tamaudun Mausoleum was built in 1501, during the reign of King Shō Shin, near the Izena Castle. In 1958, Okinawa Prefecture designated this as a Historical Site.[6] The royal mausoleum is of Shō Shishō, his wife, and daughter (the father, mother, and sister of King Shō Hashi). Izena Castle is a Ryūkyūan gusuku built around the 14th century by Samekawa, son of the Yogura Chief of Iheya Island. It is built over a limestone outcrop about 100 metres (330 ft) above sea level on the south eastern side of the island.[15] The fortress has three sides which are near vertical cliffs; the south, west and east faces of the fortress are rock cliffs, while the northern side provides entry to the castle through a series of steps cut into the hill. There are several chambers in the castle which are separated by walls, built with piled-up pieces of coral limestone, 3 metres (9.8 ft) in height.[15] The chambers have many sacred relics such as utaki (holy enclosures of the Ryūkyūan religion) and also celadons, Sueki wares, and other important objects, which are also seen in other gusuku sites. There is a bronze statue of Kanemeru, Shō En's name before his reign, in the park which commemorates his birth in Izena. The tomb holds the remains of Kanemaru.[16]\n\nThere is an ancient temple to God Asagi in Seriyaku settlement of Izena village. Festivals of harvest of rice, wheat, unzami and Shinigu and other products are held here. The temple is on the southern part of the island, which is built on four steel columns with a thatched roof of 5 metres (16 ft) square with eaves of 60 centimetres (24 in) height.[17] The floor is made of mud and the temple belongs to the Tangible Race Cultural Heritage. A notable religious place in the island is the Akara utaki (meaning sacred place) which has two rocky boulders, named umi gitara (sea bluff) and agi gitara (land bluff). The word gitara is said to have originated from India.[9] Ancestor worship is widely practiced which is a blend of Chinese and Korean beliefs locally adopted in which a mythical love story is linked to the two rocky bluffs of umi gitara and agi gitara said to represent the two lovers who died but made to live by god, as god wished it as if “gazing at each other from a close distance, they are forever in love.”[9][10]\n\nPopular sports in the island are soccer, volleyball, and soft tennis. The \"IZENA 88\" Triathlon is a regular event that is organized during October every year, in Izena village, with participants from Japan and other parts of the world.[1][10]\n\nIzena Island is accessible by the ferry New Izena, which makes two daily round trips between Nakada Port and Unten Port in Nakijin village, which is located north of Nago on Okinawa's main island. The ferry trip is approximately one hour in duration.[1] There are no airports on the island;[9][10] Naha Airport on the Okinawa Island offers the nearest air transport.[9]\n\nThere are two schools on the island, the Izena Elementary School (151 students) and the Izena Junior High School (71 students), which are supported by the Japan Exchange and Teaching (JET) program with an Assistant Teacher in English language. However, for High School the students of the Island go to Okinawa Island.[9][10]\n\nAccording to a leprosy survey carried out in Okinawa Islands, it is reported that Izena Island is one of the highest leprosy endemic islands in the northern part of the Okinawa islands.

It is usually manufactured as a powder from corn gluten meal. Zein is one of the best understood plant proteins.[1] Pure zein is clear, odorless, tasteless, hard, water-insoluble, and edible, and it has a variety of industrial and food uses.[2][3]\n\nHistorically, zein has been used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, including coatings for paper cups, soda bottle cap linings, clothing fabric,[4] buttons, adhesives, coatings and binders. The dominant historical use of zein was in the textile fibers market where it was produced under the name \"Vicara\".[2][5] With the development of synthetic alternatives, the use of zein in this market eventually disappeared. By using electrospinning, zein fibers have again been produced in the lab, where additional research will be performed to re-enter the fiber market.[6][7] It can be used as a water and grease coating for paperboards and allows recyclability.[8]\n\nZein's properties make it valuable in processed foods and pharmaceuticals, in competition with insect shellac. It is now used as a coating for candy, nuts, fruit, pills, and other encapsulated foods and drugs. In the United States, it may be labeled as \"confectioner's glaze\" (which may also refer to shellac-based glazes) and used as a coating on bakery products[9] or as \"vegetable protein.\" It is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For pharmaceutical coating, zein is preferred over food shellac, since it is all natural and requires less testing per the USP monographs.[citation needed]\n\nZein can be further processed into resins and other bioplastic polymers, which can be extruded or rolled into a variety of plastic products.[10][11] With increasing environmental concerns about synthetic coatings (such as PFOA) and the current higher prices of hydrocarbon-based petrochemicals, there is increased focus on zein as a raw material for a variety of nontoxic and renewable polymer applications, particularly in the paper industry.[12][13] Other reasons for a renewed interest in zein include concern about the landfill costs of plastics, and consumer interest in natural substances. There are also a number of potential new food industry applications.[citation needed]\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at William Wrigley Jr. Company have recently been studying the possibility of using zein to replace some of the gum base in chewing gum.[14] They are also studying medical applications such as using the zein molecule to \"carry biocompounds to targeted sites in the human body\".[15] There are a number of potential food safety applications that may be possible for zein-based packaging according to several researchers. A military contractor is researching the use of zein to protect MRE food packages.[16] Other packaging/food safety applications that have been researched include frozen foods,[17] ready-to-eat chicken,[18] and cheese and liquid eggs.[19] Food researchers in Japan have noted the ability of the zein molecule to act as a water barrier.[20]\n\nWhile there are numerous existing and potential uses for zein, the main barrier to greater commercial success has been its historic high cost until recently. Zein pricing is now very competitive with food shellac. Zein may be extracted as a byproduct in the manufacturing process for ethanol[21] or in new off-shore manufacture.[citation needed]\n\nAlpha-prolamins are the major seed storage proteins of species of the grass tribe Andropogoneae. They are unusually rich in glutamine, proline, alanine, and leucine residues and their sequences show a series of tandem repeats presumed to be the result of multiple intragenic duplication.[22] In Zea mays (Maize), the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are encoded by a large multigene family and are the major seed storage proteins accounting for 70% of the total zein fraction. Structurally the 22 kDa and 19 kDa zeins are composed of nine adjacent, topologically antiparallel helices clustered within a distorted cylinder. The 22 kDa alpha-zeins are encoded by 23 genes;[23] twenty-two of the members are found in a roughly tandem array forming a dense gene cluster. The expressed genes in the cluster are interspersed with nonexpressed genes. Some of the expressed genes differ in their transcriptional regulation. Gene amplification appears to be in blocks of genes explaining the rapid and compact expansion of the cluster during the evolution of maize.[24]ZO® Skin Health | Medical Skin Care: The season of gifting brings about so many questions of what to get for your loved ones.

It covers an area of 83.24 square kilometres (32.14 sq mi), including offshore islets. At the 2011 Census, the population was 10,583; according to the Census of 1 January 2021,[1] it counted 11,891 inhabitants, while the official estimate as at 1 January 2023 was 11,389.[2]\n\nThe island's name is said to derive from the Latin word frumentarium, meaning \"granary\". The island was occupied in prehistoric times, going back to 2,000–1,600 BC. Archaeological sites from that period remain in Ca na Costa,[3] Cap de Barbaria (multiple sites)[4] and Cova des Fum.[5] The island had been occupied by the Carthaginians before passing to the ancient Romans. In succeeding centuries, it passed to the Visigoths, the Byzantines, the Vandals, and the Arabs. In 1109, Formentera was the target of a devastating attack by the Norwegian king Sigurd I at the head of the Norwegian Crusade. The island was conquered by James I the Conqueror, added to the Crown of Aragon and later became part of the medieval Kingdom of Majorca.\n\nFrom 1403 to the early 18th century, the threat of Barbary pirate attacks rendered the island uninhabitable.[6][7] On 17 June 1651, during the Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659), a squadron of Spanish galleys under John of Austria the Younger captured the French galleon Lion Couronné off this island.\n\nThe island and its surrounding islets became a separate insular council with the same territory as the eponymous municipality after 1977. Before that, it was administered in the former insular council of Ibiza and Formentera (covering the whole group of the Pityusic Islands), but in a separate comarca which already covered the current municipality of Formentera. This reform allowed Ibiza to unify its comarca of five municipalities with its new insular council, no longer administrating Formentera.\n\nThe main island of Formentera is 19 kilometres (12 mi) long and is located about 6 kilometres (4 mi) south of Ibiza in the Mediterranean Sea. More specifically Formentera is part of the delimitation of the Balearic Sea, which is a northwestern element of the Mediterranean Sea.[8] Its major villages are Sant Francesc Xavier, Sant Ferran de ses Roques, El Pilar de la Mola (on the La Mola peninsula), La Savina, and Es Pujols, the most important tourist destination of the island.\n\nFormentera comprises one municipality, also called Formentera, and has a population of 11,981 (as of 1 January 2021). Its land area is 83.24 km2 (32.14 sq mi). It is subdivided into several civil parishes (parròquies), themselves subdivided into vendas (véndes in Catalan).\n\nNorth of Formentera is located Espalmador (in Catalan: Illa de S'Espalmador), the second largest island of the Pitiusas Islands, surrounded by a few minor islets.\n\nEspalmador is a tombolo, separated from the main island of Formentera by a shallow sandbar. This area is a popular stopping point for those in yachts heading between Ibiza and Formentera.\n\nFormentera has a semi-arid climate with hot, very dry summers and warm, dry winters. The flat orography of the island means that rainfall is scarce and the temperature is quite uniform. The average annual rainfall is 370–420 mm. The average annual temperature is between 17 and 18 °C. Overall, the climate is mild, with an average annual temperature of 18.6 degrees Celsius and 2883 hours of annual sunshine on average.\n\nElections are held every four years concurrently with local elections. From 1983 to 2007, councilors were indirectly elected from the results of the election to Parliament of the Balearic Islands for the constituencies of Ibiza and Formentera (then forming a single Island council, with Formentera sending a single councilor to both Parliament and the Island council). Since 2007, however, separate direct elections are held to elect the Island Council of Formentera, with currently 17 seats (it only sends a single one to the Balearic Parliament).\n\nSince the 1960s, Formentera has been a popular destination for hippies.[11] Formentera is renowned across Europe for many pristine white beaches and the fact that nude sunbathing is allowed on most of its beaches.[12]\n\nThroughout its history, Formentera has been the subject of many legends, written in novels by famous writers such as Jules Verne, and in songs by musicians as varied as Gilberto Gil and Pink Floyd. From this artistic curiosity, the annual Formentera Jazz Festival has been held annually in early June and features many emerging and established musicians from the local and international scene.[13]\n\nThe Canadian writer Patrick Roscoe was born in Formentera.[14] Joni Mitchell wrote her 1971 album Blue on the island while Bob Dylan once slept on the Far de la Mola on the island.[15] Author Matt Haig also writes about visiting the island often in his twenties in Reasons to Stay Alive.[15] The opening track of the King Crimson album Islands, Formentera Lady, is named after the island. James Taylor also worked on his hit song Carolina in My Mind on holiday from recording with Apple Records, though he began writing it in London and completed it on the nearby island of Ibiza.[16]\n\nThe Cap de Barbaria Lighthouse plays a pivotal role in Julio Medem's 2001 Spanish film, Sex and Lucia (Lucía y el sexo), which was filmed on the island and served as a touchstone for the various characters' interwoven relationships.[17][18]\n\nAlthough paved roads allow access to all parts of the island and cars are easily hired in the port, many people choose to rent mopeds or even bicycles due to the flat nature of most of the island and the availability of dedicated cycle tracks in many locations.\n\nThe island also has four Martello towers.[19]\n\nWith no airports, the island was formerly reachable only by boat from Ibiza, making it the quieter of the two islands, but in recent years regular passenger service from the Spanish mainland has increased tourism.\n\nFerry tickets from Ibiza are available in advance, as are transfers from Ibiza airport or port directly to accommodation in Formentera.\n\nFerries to Formentera operate from their own terminal in Ibiza port, with departures every half hour in high season on large (200+ passenger) fast catamarans. The journey takes approximately 30 minutes comprising 10 minutes leaving Ibiza, 10 minutes crossing the sea, and 10 minutes arriving in Formentera past the isthmus to Espalmador.\n\nSome of the anchorages may not be suitable for sailboats under less than ideal circumstances.[20]\n\nA local Ibizan (eivissenc) variant of the Balearic dialect of the Catalan language is spoken in Formentera. While the official languages are Catalan and Spanish, other major languages like English, Italian, German, French and Dutch can also be heard extensively in the summer due to mass tourism.\n\nFrom 1 September to 7 September, Formentera hosted the 2007 Techno 293 OD World Championships in windsurfing for juniors under 15 and youths under 17.[21]Portal Oficial del: Utilizamos cookies propias y de terceros para mejorar la experiencia de navegación y ofrecer contenidos y servicios de interés.See Formentera, The Smallest And Prettiest Of Spain’s Balearic Islands: The beautiful island of Formentera is far from a secret, but it is much less visited than its party, party, party sister island of Ibiza. In fact, it’s the smallest of Spain’s Balearic islands and in my opinion it’s the prettiest.\n\nFormentera retains a laid back and relaxed vibe, you’ll find cute souvenir shops, amazing restaurants and some of the nicest beaches in the region. Visitors come from across Spain, Germany and Italy and to a lesser extent from the United Kingdom, so although English is widely spoken, you’ll hear it less than in other busier tourist areas.\n\nThe other Balearic islands include Ibiza, Mallorca (Majorca) and Menorca.\n\nSometimes travel writers don’t really want to tell the world about a special place. They fear that it will become too popular and be overrun with tourists. We have to weigh up the benefits of promoting somewhere truly amazing, including considering the positive impact it can have on the local economy, with the danger of overloading the area with visitors.\n\nBecause Formentera is an island in Spain in an already developed and booming tourism industry, it’s safe to point people this way and let them discover the quieter side of the Balearic Islands.\n\nHead this way for sun, seclusion and amazing seafood!\n\nHow Do You Get To Formentera?\n\nYou can access the island via a ferry ride from Ibiza. The journey takes you from Ibiza Town to La Savina and takes between thirty minutes to an hour.\n\nOnce on the island you can hire a bicycle, car, or a moped or use taxis and buses to get around.\n\nFor a luxurious stay, choose the beautiful five star oasis of Five Flowers Hotel Spa Formentera near Es Pujols beach.\n\nThe hotel is a riot of color including the nightly illumination of the building which makes a pretty show to watch as you enjoy a drink at the rooftop bar.\n\nAlmost as beautiful is the less colorful but equally stylish Blanco Hotel just steps away from Five Flowers. This hotel is bathed in clean, sophisticated, white. The color features everywhere in the design and provides a beautiful backdrop against the sun.\n\nSome rooms come with a rooftop Jacuzzi and an expansive balcony space.\n\nThe staff at both hotels are amazingly friendly and intuitive, this is effortless customer service that ensures every guest feels special.\n\nThe breakfast buffet at Blanco hotel is really tasty and varied, as is their lunch and dinner menus but for special occasions head over to Five Flowers and up to their rooftop Japanese restaurant Kokoy.\n\nHere you can try the multi course tasting menu and feast on locally sourced seafood and delicious sushi.\n\nIf you fancy something different wander down to the beach at Es Pujos and dine at any of the boardwalk restaurants which offer beautiful ocean views.\n\nIt’s easy to relax in Formentera, as the locals say, “It’s paradise here!”\n\nSpend your day on the beach at Es Pujos right by your hotel or take a short taxi ride to Platja Illetes, one of the most popular beaches on the island. It can get really packed with visitors here in the summer, but the waters are beautifully clear and the sand is soft and clean.\n\nWalk a little farther down passing the Juan y Andrea restaurant until you reach Playa de Levante and you may well be able to find a secluded spot of beach all to yourself!\n\nDon’t be alarmed, there is a nude beach here. If you’re not up for au natrel sunbathing just keep walking and you’ll come to a regular beach soon enough.\n\nFrom oceanfront cafes and bars to the beautiful fig trees and all those white sandy beaches, Formentera truly is the prettiest little island in Spain.Formentera Partners: Formentera Partners is an energy-focused, private equity strategy founded by Bryan Sheffield and Blake London in 2020.

With nine league championships and twelve Norwegian Cup wins, FFK is one of the most successful clubs in Norwegian football. The club was founded in 1903 and currently play in Eliteserien from 2024 after promotion from Norwegian First Division in 2023.\n\nAfter suffering relegation from the then 1st division in 1984, Fredrikstad spent 18 years outside the top flight, before returning to the top division in 2004 after two successive promotions.\n\nFredrikstad stadion was FFK's home ground between 1914 and 2006. However, its facilities were outdated and the club moved to a new stadium on the other side of river Glomma. Their new ground is located in a former shipyard, incorporating parts of the old buildings in the two side stands. FFK draw great support from their area and the official supporter club's name is Plankehaugen. More than 100 coaches filled with fans followed FFK to the cup final of 2006. The club's supporters include an Ultras section, Supras Fredrikstad. The club had for some years a casual mob, Brigade Rød-Hvit (Brigade Red - White) which was active in the hooligan scene in Norway.\n\nFredrikstad Fotballklubb was founded on 7 April 1903. While football in many older clubs was an addition to other established forms of sport, such as skiing or athletics, FFK was the first club in Norway to focus uniquely on playing football, and as such may be labeled the first true football club in the country. A lack of opposition meant this was in fact the third attempt at establishing a football club in Fredrikstad (tradition has it that the second attempt died out when the only football landed on a freight train bound for Moss). Finding someone in the vicinity to play against was still a problem when FFK was founded.\n\nIt so happened that the Englishman H. W. Kenworthy, who lived in the neighboring town of Sarpsborg, wanted to practice his native country's sport and traveled to Fredrikstad to take part in one of FFK's training sessions. Upon his return to Sarpsborg, it was suggested that he arrange for a new club to be established. The idea was well received in Sarpsborg, and Sarpsborg F.C. was founded on 8 May 1903. The first match between the teams was played the following year in Sarpsborg in front of 600 spectators. FFK won the historical match 4–0. Sarpsborg and Fredrikstad went on to establish the first regional series and inspired the founding of many new clubs in the region in the years to come.\n\nFFK didn't have the red and white colors when the club was founded in 1903. In fact, they changed suits seven times from 1903 to 1927. The colors that they wear now come from Polish National team. When FFK asked Polish Football Association if they could use their colours, they received positive reply and even set of clothes in the colours as a gift.\n\nFFK reached the Norwegian Cup final for the first time in 1932. The semifinal against Mjøndalen was played at home in front of a record 9,000 spectators, and FFK won the match 3–0. Fredrikstad met Ørn Horten in the final, winning 6–1, and were thus Norwegian Champions. This signaled the start of Fredrikstad's first successful era, in which the club claimed four more cup titles before the start of World War II. FFK became the first club to win the new nationwide league, in 1937–38, and they won The Double the following season.\n\nIn the 1930s, the club also had an active bandy department.[2]\n\nDuring the German occupation no organized football took place, as a result of all athletes going on strike in support of the resistance. After the war football was more popular than ever, and Fredrikstad set another attendance record against Sarpsborg in the semifinal of the 1945 Norwegian Cup. There was, however, little success on the pitch. FFK reached three cup finals in four years but lost all of them. The break came in 1949 when FFK won its third league title.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were highly successful years for FFK. The club secured the league title six times – back to back in 1950–51 and 1951–52 – and finished in second place seven times. The Norwegian Cup was won four times. In 1957, a new milestone was achieved when FFK won their second double. As league champions in 1960, Fredrikstad entered the European Cup as the first team from Norway, sensationally defeating Ajax 4–3 at home and drawing 0–0 in Amsterdam, in the first round.\n\nThe town of Fredrikstad was in many ways an economic powerhouse in Norway in the previous century, first as a major supplier of machinery to the timber industry and then as a center of shipbuilding activities. At one point the shipyard in Fredrikstad was the largest in Scandinavia. It has been said that there was always an air of optimism surrounding the town and its inhabitants, and it was certainly reflected in FFK's playful and relaxed style of football, which many regarded as the most entertaining in the country. The club's first cup triumph in '32 even made Jørgen Juve, a legend in Norwegian football, state: \"This is how football is supposed to be played.\"\n\nPerhaps it was because of this relaxed atmosphere that the club was so successful, and also why it eventually fell into decline. After years of glory, the club was becoming conservative, although they would not admit it themselves. Other clubs were increasingly turning to professionalism, while players from FFK still played football in addition to having normal jobs. Training regimes were becoming more rigorous than before, but in Fredrikstad, they felt that training more than twice a week would ruin the joy of playing football. There is also the sentiment that, in light of the club's formidable history, newer generations of FFK players were given too much responsibility, folding to the pressure again and again whenever things were starting to look brighter.\n\nFredrikstad was to struggle throughout the 1970s. They reached the cup final in 1971 but lost to Rosenborg, who was by now firmly en route to becoming a giant in Norwegian football. In 1972, they were runners-up in the league to Viking FK only on goal difference, as both teams finished the season on 34 points.[3] In 1973, for the first time in the club's history, FFK was relegated. They immediately gained promotion via the playoffs and by 1975 were back in the highest division, where they stayed for two seasons before facing relegation yet again.\n\nThe elevator ride between divisions continued until 1984. The Norwegian Cup went to Fredrikstad that year, but it must have been a bittersweet success. The club was once again relegated, and this time they were unable to make it back to the top flight. In 1992, FFK was relegated to the third highest division, where they would languish until 2002.\n\nFredrikstad's comeback from obscurity is largely attributed to the manager Knut Torbjørn Eggen, who introduced a degree of professionalism the club had previously lacked. During his tenure, from 2001 until the end of 2006, the son of Rosenborg's successful former coach led the team to their first title in more than two decades. In 2002, they were promoted from the 2. divisjon to the 1. divisjon, and in 2003, their centenary year, Fredrikstad finished second, earning promotion to the top division. Although struggling to maintain their form through an entire season, Fredrikstad has managed to retain their spot three times, and in 2006 they won the Norwegian Cup for the eleventh time in their history. They came 2nd and won silver in the 2008 season, but were relegated after a poor season in 2009 to 1. division. They eventually got promoted back to Tippeligaen through playoffs in November 2010 by first beating Løv-Ham 2–0, then Hønefoss BK with a stunning 8–1 goal difference over two matches.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, the offices of the club were raided by Norwegian police in connection with the Raio Piiroja contract investigations[4]\n\nAfter their relegation from the Eliteserien in 2012, Fredrikstad spent time in the Obos-Ligaen (2012-2017, 2021-2023) and PostNord-ligaen (2018-2020) before earning promotion back to the Eliteserien in 2024 under new manager Mikkjal Thomassen.\n\nIn the early years of the club, Fredrikstad changed attire quite frequently. The first kit, for example, consisted of blue and white striped shirts and black shorts, but was changed after only two years, to white shirts and blue shorts. In 1910, a green and white kit was adopted ahead of the club's first semifinal in the Norwegian Cup.\n\nThe seventh and final iteration of Fredrikstad's kit was introduced after a match between Norway and Poland at Fredrikstad stadion, on 7 October 1926. Fredrikstad would request of the Polish Football Association that they use the Polish national colors for the Polish national team:\n\nThe club received from the Polish association the new kit on 17 March 1927, when it became the official colors of Fredrikstad. The kit has since changed little in appearance apart from the socks, which went from being red and white to purely white in 1997.\n\nFFK's badge, a green and white streamer with a football and the initials F.F. (the original abbreviation for Fredrikstad Fotballklubb was F.F.), has remained virtually unchanged since its introduction in 1909. When the Fredrikstad kit changed to white and red, the colors of the streamer changed as well.\n\nThe old Fredrikstad stadion was inaugurated in 1914 and was the first stadium in Norway with floodlighting. FFK's record attendance was set in 1956 against Larvik Turn. 15,534 spectators showed up for this quarter-final match of the Norwegian Cup. The stadium's last renovation occurred ahead of the 2004 season, putting the capacity at around 10,500.\n\nA new home ground was built for the 2007 season at Fredrikstad Mekaniske Verksted (colloquially known as \"Værste\"), an old shipyard in the center of Fredrikstad. This was once the largest shipyard in Scandinavia, and the architecture of the stadium is such that two of the now defunct mechanical workshops, dating from as far back as 1870, are converted into stands at the sides. In addition, two separate stands are built at the ends of the pitch. The new stadium (with the same name, Fredrikstad stadion) has an all-seater capacity of 12,550.\n\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

FFK har vunnet ni seriemesterskap, tolv cupmesterskap og syv sølvpokaler. Siste seieren i cupen kom i 2024. Merittlisten gjør FFK til en av de mestvinnende klubbene i norsk fotballhistorie.[2]\n\nNår fotballen først ankom Fredrikstad, er vanskelig å fastslå med sikkerhet. Det er likevel kjent at sporten ble spilt flere steder i byen allerede på slutten av 1800-tallet, sannsynligvis introdusert av engelske sjømenn. På De britiske øyer hadde ulike former for fotball eksistert i århundrer, og gjennom 1800-tallet ble mange av de reglene som fortsatt gjelder, utviklet.\n\nOrganiserte fotballklubber hadde allerede blitt etablert andre steder i Norge. Christiania Footballclub, landets første fotballklubb, ble stiftet i 1885. I 1902 ble Norges første norgesmester kåret da Idrettsklubben Grane fra Oslo beseiret Odds Ballklubb fra Skien.\n\nFredrikstad fikk sitt første organiserte fotballag i 1897, da Fredrikstad Ynglingeforening startet et lag som holdt til på Phønixplassen, hvor Fredrikstad bibliotek ligger i dag. En annonse fra Yndlingeforeningen publisert i Fredrikstads aviser 24. mai 1902 vitner om fotballens økende popularitet:[3]\n\nVinteren 1901/02 ble Fredrikstad Boldklub stiftet, blant annet takket være den danske innflytteren Theodor Hansen, som senere spilte en viktig rolle i stiftelsen av Fredrikstad Fotballklubb. En anekdote forteller at klubbens skjebne ble beseglet under en trening på Trara, da ballen ble sparket opp i en godsvogn på vei til Moss. Uten ball var det ikke mulig å spille, og Fredrikstad Boldklub ble til slutt oppløst.[4]\n\nEt av medlemmene i Fredrikstad Ynglingeforening var Reidar Bergh, som senere skulle bli president i Norges Fotballforbund. En vårdag i mars 1903 var han ute på rusletur og møtte fire venner mellom Phønix og Pay-gården. Sammen betraktet de Phønixplassen og Vesterelva.\n\nUttalelsen ble snart fulgt opp med handling. Den 7. april 1903 ble Fredriksstad Fodboldklub grunnlagt, Norges første rene fotballklubb. Stiftelsesmøtet ble holdt på Victoria Hotell, og det første styret besto av Halfdan Schübeler Christiansen (formann), Jul. Schie (viseformann), Reidar Bergh (sekretær), Alf Jacobsen (kasserer) og Leif Eriksen (styremedlem).\n\nFor å etablere en solid grunnmur for klubben, kontaktet Harald M. Lund avisen Tilskueren for å skaffe til veie fotballregler fra England. 14. april 1903 kunne lokalpressen melde at “Klubben har med det første tænkt at begynde sine øvelser.” Også fotballutstyr ble importert fra England. Den første treningen fant sted på Phønixplassen 21. april, med 14 spillere til stede.\n\nLeif Eriksen, en tidligere Lyn-spiller fra Oslo, var lagets desidert beste spiller. Han overtok kapteinsbindet fra Reidar Bergh, som selv innrømmet at lagets generelle ferdighetsnivå var lavt:\n\nKlubbens rykte spredte seg raskt. I Sarpsborg, der organisert idrett var lite utbredt, fikk FFK besøk av den britiske ingeniøren H.W. Kenworthy. Han hadde tidligere spilt for klubben St. James i sin hjemby Glossop, Derbyshire, og ønsket nå å bli med i den nystartede Fredrikstad-klubben.\n\nSelv om Kenworthy var en erfaren spiller, syntes noen det var upassende å ha en Sarpsborg-innbygger på laget. Reidar Bergh foreslo i stedet at Kenworthy skulle starte en egen klubb i Sarpsborg, slik at FFK kunne få en motstander. En måned senere, 8. mai 1903, ble Sarpsborg Footballclub stiftet.\n\nDen første kampen mellom de to klubbene lot imidlertid vente på seg. En avtalt kamp ble først utsatt, deretter avlyst, noe som førte til irritasjon blant Fredrikstad-spillerne. De erklærte at de ikke ville spille mot en “uvederheftig klubb som Sarpsborg Footballclub.” Dermed brukte FFK sitt første år kun på trening.\n\nMot slutten av året rapporterte klubben om “usedvanlig hidsig spill” under sesongens siste treningsøkt 4. oktober 1903. Da FFK ble invitert til å delta i Norgesmesterskapet det påfølgende året, ble dette avslått ettersom \"Klubben ansaa sig ikke øvet nok til at deltage i et Norgesmesterskap.\"\n\nDen første kampen mellom Fredrikstad og Sarpsborg ble spilt i 1904 etter foran 600 tilskuere. FFK vant den historiske kampen 4-0. Sarpsborg og Fredrikstad etablerte den første kretsserien, og inspirerte til opprettelsen av mange nye klubber i årene som fulgte.\n\nFFK brukte ikke røde og hvite drakter da klubben ble grunnlagt i 1903. Faktisk endret klubben drakter sju ganger fra 1903 til 1927, da de endelig landet på de draktene som benyttes i dag. Draktene er basert på fargene til den polske landslagsdrakt, som i sin tid ble gitt som gave. FFK kopierte fargene, og ble en vennskapsklubb med det polske landslaget. Dette forholdet har nå gått i glemmeboken, både i Fredrikstad og i Polen.\n\nFFK spilte sin første kamp i NM i 1905 mot Porsgrunds Fodboldklub, men vant sin første NM-kamp mot Gjøvik-Lyn i 1908. Resultatet ble 4-2. FFK kom til cupfinalen for første gang i 1932. Semifinalen ble spilt mot Mjøndalen på hjemmebane foran en publikumsrekord på 9 000 tilskuere. FFK vant 3-2. I finalen møtte Fredrikstad Ørn Horten, og vant hele 6-1. FFK var det tredje laget fra Østfold som vant NM, etter Sarpsborg FK og Kvik Halden. Cupgullet i 1932 ble starten på Fredrikstads første suksessrike æra, og klubben vant enda fire cuptitler før andre verdenskrig. FFK ble også den første klubben som vant den nasjonale serien, i 1937-38, og de vant dobbelen (serien og cupen) året etter.\n\nUnder den tyske okkupasjonen ble det ikke spilt organisert fotball, siden alle spillerne streiket til støtte for motstandsbevegelsen. Etter krigen ble fotball mer populært enn noen gang, og Fredrikstad satte nok en publikumsrekord mot Sarpsborg. Det skjedde i semifinalen i cupen i 1945. Derimot var det lite suksess utpå banen. FFK nådde tre cupfinaler på fire år, men tapte alle. Gjennombruddet kom i 1949, da FFK vant sin tredje ligatittel.\n\n50- og 60-tallet var svært suksessrike år for FFK. Klubben tok hjem ligagullet seks ganger og sølvet sju ganger. Cupen ble vunnet fire ganger. I 1957 en ny milepæl ble nådd da FFK vant sin andre dobbeltriumf. Etter å ha vunnet ligagullet i 1960 deltok Fredrikstad i europacupen som det første norske laget noensinne. FFK vant sensasjonelt 4-3 over Ajax hjemme. Returkampen i Amsterdam endte 0-0 i første runde.\n\nByen Fredrikstad hadde en økonomisk storhetstid i Norge i forrige århundre. Først som en stor leverandør av maskiner til skogsindustrien og deretter som et senter for skipsverftsindustrien. På et tidspunkt var verftet i Fredrikstad det største i Skandinavia. Det var en optimistisk stemning blant byens innbyggere - noe det har blitt påstått ble gjenspeilet i FFKs spillende fotballstil, av noen oppfattet som den mest underholdende fotballen i landet. Klubbens første cuptriumf i 1932 fikk Jørgen Juve, en legende i norsk fotball, til å uttale:\n\nKanskje var det på grunn av atmosfæren at klubben ble så suksessrik, og kanskje også derfor nedturen begynte. Etter år med ære og berømmelse startet klubben å bli mer konservativ, selv om ingen ville innrømme akkurat det. Andre klubber ble profesjonalisert, mens spillerne i FFK fortsatt hadde fotballen som en hobby ved siden av normale jobber. Treningsregimer ble strengere enn tidligere, men i Fredrikstad følte man at å trene mer enn to ganger i uka ville ødelegge moroa ved å spille fotball.\n\nFredrikstad slet gjennom hele 70-tallet. De nådde cupfinalen i 1971, men tapte for Rosenborg, som nå var på god vei til å bli den nye storheten i norsk fotball. To år senere, og for første gang i klubbens historie, rykket FFK ned en divisjon. I 1975 var de tilbake i øverste divisjon, men de ble der kun to år før neste nedrykk var et faktum.\n\nFFK ble et heislag mellom divisjonene helt fram til 1984. Og selv om klubben vant cupen dette året, så ble Cupgullet i 1984 starten på en lang nedtur for Fredrikstad. Med hele ni seriemesterskap og elleve cupmesterskap i skapet glimret rødbuksene med sitt fravær fra toppen av norsk fotball resten av 80-tallet og hele 90-tallet.\n\nI 2002 rykket FFK opp fra andredivisjon til førstedivisjon og i 2003 rykket klubben opp til eliteserien.[trenger referanse] Fredrikstad FK ble norgesmestere etter at de slo Sandefjord i 3–0 i cupfinalen. I 2009 rykket laget ned til 1. divisjon og rykket opp til Eliteserien igjen i 2010, men rykket ned i til 1. divisjon etter 2012-sesongen. 23. november 2015 presenterte klubben Jan Halvor Halvorsen som ny FFK trener etter at Arne Erlandsens kontrakt med klubben ikke ble forlenget. 9. august 2016 annonserte klubben at samarbeidet med Jan Halvor Halvorsen var avsluttet på grunn av manglende resultater, og senere samme dag ble Mons Ivar Mjelde ansatt som ny hovedtrener i klubben.[trenger referanse]\n\nDe endte på 2. plass i 2. divisjon i 2018. I 2023 rykket FFK opp til Eliteserien, etter å ha havnet på 1. plass i OBOS-ligaen med 64 poeng. I 2024 var FFK tilbake i Eliteserien og kom på 6. plass. De vant også cupfinalen i 2024, som måtte avgjøres ved straffesparkkonkurranse etter at kampen endte 0-0 etter ordinær tid og ekstraomganger. Dette var den første norske cupfinalen som endte uten at noen av lagene skåret mål.\n\nFFK er kjennetegnet av stadige lederbytter, særlig siden klubbdriften ble flyttet over i et ASA-selskap i 1997. Siden årtusenskiftet har følgende sittet på toppen som daglig leder:Fredrikstad FK - Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre: El Fredrikstad FK, también conocido como «Aristokratene» o simplemente «FFK», es un club de fútbol noruego fundado en 1903 ubicado en Fredrikstad, Noruega. Actualmente compite en la Eliteserien (Primera categoría noruega).\n\nEl Fredrikstad FK es uno de los equipos con mayor tradición e historia del fútbol noruego, y el más laureado a nivel nacional hasta mediados de los años 90s.\n\nEl Fredrikstad Fotballklubb fue fundado el 7 de abril de 1903. Mientras que otros clubes antiguos eran añadidos sobre clubes existentes de otros deportes como esquí o atletismo, el FFK fue el primer club de Noruega centrado enteramente en el fútbol, comenzando por el Amateurismo.\n\nEncontrar rivales en aquella época era complicado. H.W. Kenworthy, inglés residente en la vecina ciudad de Sarpsborg tras acudir a un entrenamiento del FFK promueve la formación del Sarpsborg FK el 8 de mayo de 1903, jugando el año siguiente el primer partido entre ambos equipos en Sarpsborg ante 600 espectadores, con resultado de 0-4 para el Fredrikstad FK.\n\nEn 1932, consigue el primer título de Copa de Noruega, tras derrotar en semifinales al Mjøndalen por 3-0 ante un récord de 9000 espectadores. En la final se impone al Ørn Horten por 6-1. Este título es el comienzo de una época brillante y de mucho éxito, en la que consigue otros 4 títulos de Copa de Noruega y dos de la recién creada Liga Noruega de Fútbol (primer campeón de Liga), incluyendo un doblete, convirtiéndose en el primer equipo noruego en conseguirlo, y lo logró en las primeras dos ediciones.\n\nTras el paréntesis de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, sin competiciones oficiales, el fútbol se hizo más popular que nunca, y el Fredrikstad consiguió un nuevo récord de espectadores en la semifinal de copa de 1945 frente al Sarpsborg FK, siendo esa una de las 3 finales en 4 años, todas ellas sin conquistar el título. La racha se rompió con la consecución del tercer título de Liga Noruega de Fútbol en 1949, terminando de manera impecable el Campeonato.\n\nLos años 1950 y años 1960 fueron muy exitosos para el Fredrikstad FK. El club consiguió seis títulos de Liga Noruega de Fútbol (y 7 subcampeonatos) y 4 títulos de Copa de Noruega, incluyendo su segundo doblete en 1957. En el año 1961 cabe destacar, eliminó al Ajax de Ámsterdam en la Copa de Europa, y se convierte en el primer equipo noruego y de Escandinavia en eliminar a otro en competiciones europeas.\n\nSin embargo tras estos éxitos el club entró en un periodo de decadencia. Mientras otros clubes daban un paso hacia el profesionalismo, el FFK mantenía una estructura más amateur. Y aunque se llegó a la final de la Copa de Noruega en 1971 (derrotados por un incipiente Rosenborg), dos años después descendía por primera vez en su historia. En 1975 se conseguía el ascenso, pero para descender nuevamente dos años después.\n\nEsta dinámica de ascensos y descensos continuó hasta 1984, año en que se consigue el título de Copa de Noruega pero se vuelve a descender esta vez de forma más duradera.\n\nEn 1992 el Fredrikstad FK desciende a la Tercera División Noruega, de la que no saldría hasta 2002.\n\nLa vuelta a la élite del FFK, se atribuye en gran medida a Knut Torbjørn Eggen, quien introdujo un cierto grado de profesionalismo en el club. Durante su estancia desde 2001 hasta finales de 2006 Knut Torbjørn Eggen lideró el equipo hasta su primer título en más de 2 décadas. En 2002 se asciende de la Tercera División Noruega a la Adeccoligaen, y en 2003 el año de su centenario se asciende a la Tippeligaen, consiguiendo en 2006 su undécima Copa de Noruega, y poco tiempo después volvió a descender pero de la mano de una en ese entonces joven estrella y desconocido como lo es el costarricense Celso Borges, hicieron una temporada de ensueño y logró ascender nuevamente.\n\nEn sus primeros años la equipación del Fredrikstad FK cambió frecuentemente (hasta 7 veces desde 1903 hasta 1927. Empezó siendo a rayas azules y blancas con pantalón negro. Tras dos años se pasó a camiseta blanca y pantalones azules. En 1910 se utilizó una blanca y verde de cara a la primera semifinal de la copa noruega.\n\nFinalmente, la equipación actual se empezó a utilizar tras un partido entre Noruega y Polonia en el estadio del Fredrikstad el 7 de octubre de 1926. El Fredrikstad quería utilizar los colores de Polonia y se envió una carta a la Asociación Polaca de Fútbol solicitando permiso. La Asociación Polaca de Fútbol dio su permiso y el 17 de marzo de 1927 de decidió oficialmente que esa sería la equipación original del Fredrikstad FK que se mantiene hasta el día de hoy.\n\nDesde entonces la equipación ha cambiado muy poco, pasando sólo las medias de ser blanquirrojas a blancas únicamente en 1997.\n\nEl Fredrikstad FK juega sus partidos en el Fredrikstad Stadion inaugurado en 2007 y con una capacidad de 12 500 espectadores.\n\nHasta 2007 el Fredrikstad FK jugaba sus partidos en el antiguo Nye Fredrikstad stadion, inaugurado en 1914. El récord de asistencia se estableció en 1956 con 15 534 espectadores en un encuentro contra el Larvik Turn & IF. La última remodelación del Nye Fredrikstad stadion fue en 2004, dejando la capacidad en 10 500 espectadores.\n\nPara la temporada 2007 se inauguró el Fredrikstad Stadion, construido en lo que un día fue el mayor astillero de la Península Escandinava, y uno de los de más capacidad de la Categoría.\n• Mayor victoria como local: 10-0 al Odd Grenland BK, 20 de agosto de 1961\n• Mayor victoria como visitante: 10-0 al Hadeland Fotball, 7 de julio de 2002\n• Mayor derrota como local: 0-5 frente al Vålerenga IF, 23 de agosto de 1992\n• Mayor derrota como visitante: 3-9 frente al Strømsgodset IF, 11 de mayo de 1972\n• Mayor número de espectadores, Fredrikstad stadion: 15 534 contra el Larvik Turn & IF, 9 de septiembre de 1956\n• Récord a mayor número de espectadores en un partido de Liga: 15.340\n• Mayor número de espectadores en un partido de Copa: 15.000\n• Primer equipo de Escandinavia (Noruega) en eliminar a un equipo de otro país en partidos de Copa Europea, eliminando al Ajax de Ámsterdam : 1960-61.\n• Primer Equipo de Noruega en conseguir el doblete de Liga y Copa: 1937-38.\n• En los años 1937-42, el Fredrikstad FK era el club más ganador de Noruega hasta ese entonces."}
