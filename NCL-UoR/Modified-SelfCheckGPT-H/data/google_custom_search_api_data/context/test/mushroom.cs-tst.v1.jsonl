Wikipedia: The Czech Republic,[c][12] also known as Czechia,[d][13] and historically known as Bohemia,[14] is a landlocked country in Central Europe. The country is bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast, and Slovakia to the southeast.[15] The Czech Republic has a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,871 square kilometers (30,452 sq mi) with a mostly temperate continental and oceanic climate. The capital and largest city is Prague; other major cities and urban areas include Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Liberec.\n\nThe Duchy of Bohemia was founded in the late 9th century under Great Moravia. It was formally recognized as an Imperial Estate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1002 and became a kingdom in 1198.[16][17] Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, all of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. Nearly a hundred years later, the Protestant Bohemian Revolt led to the Thirty Years' War. After the Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburgs consolidated their rule. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Crown lands became part of the Austrian Empire.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Czech lands became more industrialized; further, in 1918, most of the country became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic following the collapse of Austria-Hungary after World War I.[18] Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a parliamentary democracy during the entirety of the interwar period.[19] After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Nazi Germany systematically took control over the Czech lands. Czechoslovakia was restored in 1945 and three years later became an Eastern Bloc communist state following a coup d'état in 1948. Attempts to liberalize the government and economy were suppressed by a Soviet-led invasion of the country during the Prague Spring in 1968. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended communist rule in the country and restored democracy. On 31 December 1992, Czechoslovakia was peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nThe Czech Republic is a unitary parliamentary republic and developed country with an advanced, high-income social market economy. It is a welfare state with a European social model, universal health care and free-tuition university education. It ranks 32nd in the Human Development Index. The Czech Republic is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, the OECD, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Visegrád Group.\n\nThe traditional English name \"Bohemia\" derives from Latin Boiohaemum, which means \"home of the Boii\" (a Gallic tribe). The current English name ultimately comes from the Czech word Čech.[20][21][22] The name comes from the Slavic tribe (Czech: Češi, Čechové) and, according to legend, their leader Čech, who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on Říp Mountain. The etymology of the word Čech is uncertain, but according to the most common derivation can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic root *čel-, meaning \"member of the people; kinsman\", thus making it cognate to the Czech word člověk (a person).[23][24][25][26]\n\nThe country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely Bohemia (Čechy) in the west, Moravia (Morava) in the east, and Czech Silesia (Slezsko; the smaller, south-eastern part of historical Silesia, most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast.[27] Known as the lands of the Bohemian Crown since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, Czechia,[28] and the lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslaus. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the new name of Czechoslovakia was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within one country.[29]\n\nAfter Czechoslovakia dissolved on the last day of 1992, Česko was adopted as the Czech short name for the new state and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic recommended Czechia for the English-language equivalent.[30] This form was not widely adopted at the time, leading to the long name Czech Republic being used in English in nearly all circumstances. The Czech government directed use of Czechia as the official English short name in 2016.[31] The short name has been listed by the United Nations[32] and is used by other organizations such as the European Union,[33] NATO,[34] the CIA,[35] Google Maps,[36] and the European Broadcasting Union.[37] In 2022, the American AP Stylebook stated in its entry on the country that \"both [Czechia and the Czech Republic] are acceptable. The shorter name Czechia is preferred by the Czech government. If using Czechia, clarify in the story that the country is more widely known in English as the Czech Republic.\"[38]\n\nArchaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the Paleolithic era.[citation needed]\n\nIn the classical era, as a result of the 3rd century BC Celtic migrations, Bohemia became associated with the Boii.[41] The Boii founded an oppidum near the site of modern Prague.[42] Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the Marcomanni and Quadi settled there.[43]\n\nSlavs from the Black Sea–Carpathian region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe into their area:[44] Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Magyars).[45] In the sixth century, the Huns had moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day Austria and Germany.[45]\n\nDuring the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo, supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled Avars,[46] became the ruler of the first documented Slavic state in Central Europe, Samo's Empire. The principality of Great Moravia, controlled by Moymir dynasty, arose in the 8th century.[47] It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of Svatopluk I of Moravia), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a role being played by the Byzantine mission of Cyril and Methodius. They codified the Old Church Slavonic language, the first literary and liturgical language of the Slavs, and the Glagolitic script.[48]\n\nThe Duchy of Bohemia emerged in the late 9th century when it was unified by the Přemyslid dynasty. Bohemia was from 1002 until 1806 an Imperial Estate of the Holy Roman Empire.[49]\n\nIn 1212, Přemysl Ottokar I extracted the Golden Bull of Sicily from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a Kingdom.[50] German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century.[51] The Mongols in the invasion of Europe carried their raids into Moravia but were defensively defeated at Olomouc.[52]\n\nAfter a series of dynastic wars, the House of Luxembourg gained the Bohemian throne.[53]\n\nEfforts for a reform of the church in Bohemia started already in the late 14th century. Jan Hus' followers seceded from some practices of the Roman Church and in the Hussite Wars (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by Sigismund. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemia and Moravia were considered Hussites. The pacifist thinker Petr Chelčický inspired the movement of the Moravian Brethren (by the middle of the 15th century) that completely separated from the Roman Catholic Church.[54]\n\nOn 21 December 1421, Jan Žižka, a successful military commander and mercenary, led his group of forces in the Battle of Kutná Hora, resulting in a victory for the Hussites. He is honoured to this day as a national hero.\n\nAfter 1526, Bohemia came increasingly under Habsburg control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. Between 1583 and 1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and his court.\n\nThe Defenestration of Prague and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the Thirty Years' War. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the Battle of White Mountain and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The leaders of the Bohemian Revolt were executed in 1621. The nobility and the middle class Protestants had to either convert to Catholicism or leave the country.[55]\n\nThe following era of 1620 to the late 18th century became known as the \"Dark Age\". During the Thirty Years' War, the population of the Czech lands declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and famine.[56] The Habsburgs prohibited all Christian confessions other than Catholicism.[57] The flowering of Baroque culture shows the ambiguity of this historical period. Ottoman Turks and Tatars invaded Moravia in 1663.[58] In 1679–1680 the Czech lands faced the Great Plague of Vienna and an uprising of serfs.[59]\n\nThere were peasant uprisings influenced by famine.[60] Serfdom was abolished between 1781 and 1848. Several battles of the Napoleonic Wars took place on the current territory of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of Bohemia which lost its position of an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire as well as its own political representation in the Imperial Diet.[61] Bohemian lands became part of the Austrian Empire. During the 18th and 19th century the Czech National Revival began its rise, with the purpose to revive Czech language, culture, and national identity. The Revolution of 1848 in Prague, striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the Bohemian Crown within the Austrian Empire, was suppressed.[62]\n\nIt seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end, the Emperor Franz Joseph I affected a compromise with Hungary only. The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a disappointment of some Czech politicians.[62] The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called Cisleithania.\n\nThe Czech Social Democratic and progressive politicians started the fight for universal suffrage. The first elections under universal male suffrage were held in 1907.[63]\n\nIn 1918, during the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy at the end of World War I, the independent republic of Czechoslovakia, which joined the winning Allied powers, was created, with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk in the lead.[65] This new country incorporated the Bohemian Crown.[66]\n\nThe First Czechoslovak Republic comprised only 27% of the population of the former Austria-Hungary, but nearly 80% of the industry, which enabled it to compete with Western industrial states.[64] In 1929 compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938 Czechoslovakia held 10th place in the world industrial production.[67] Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a liberal democracy throughout the entire interwar period.[68] Although the First Czechoslovak Republic was a unitary state, it provided certain rights to its minorities, the largest being Germans (23.6% in 1921), Hungarians (5.6%) and Ukrainians (3.5%).[69]\n\nWestern Czechoslovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany, which placed most of the region into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The Protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinated to Nazi Germany's Reichsprotektor. One Nazi concentration camp was located within the Czech territory at Terezín, north of Prague. The vast majority of the Protectorate's Jews were murdered in Nazi-run concentration camps. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion, Germanization or enslavement of most or all Czechs for the purpose of providing more living space for the German people.[70] There was Czechoslovak resistance to Nazi occupation as well as reprisals against the Czechoslovaks for their anti-Nazi resistance. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the Prague uprising.[71] Most of Czechoslovakia's German-speakers were forcibly expelled from the country, first as a result of local acts of violence and then under the aegis of an \"organized transfer\" confirmed by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain at the Potsdam Conference.[72]\n\nIn the 1946 elections, the Communist Party gained 38%[73] of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament, formed a coalition with other parties, and consolidated power. A coup d'état came in 1948 and a single-party government was formed. For the next 41 years, the Czechoslovak Communist state conformed to Eastern Bloc economic and political features.[74] The Prague Spring political liberalization was stopped by the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Analysts believe that the invasion caused the communist movement to fracture, ultimately leading to the Revolutions of 1989.\n\nIn November 1989, Czechoslovakia again became a liberal democracy through the Velvet Revolution. However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened (Hyphen War) and on 31 December 1992, the country peacefully split into the independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both countries went through economic reforms and privatizations, with the intention of creating a market economy, as they have been trying to do since 1990, when Czechs and Slovaks still shared the common state. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognized by the World Bank as a \"developed country\",[75] and in 2009 the Human Development Index ranked it as a nation of \"Very High Human Development\".[76]\n\nFrom 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the Visegrád Group and from 1995, the OECD. The Czech Republic joined NATO on 12 March 1999 and the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the Schengen Area.[77]\n\nUntil 2017, either the centre-left Czech Social Democratic Party or the centre-right Civic Democratic Party led the governments of the Czech Republic. In October 2017, the populist movement ANO 2011, led by the country's second-richest man, Andrej Babiš, won the elections with three times more votes than its closest rival, the Civic Democrats.[78] In December 2017, Czech president Miloš Zeman appointed Andrej Babiš as the new prime minister.[79]\n\nIn the 2021 elections, ANO 2011 was narrowly defeated and Petr Fiala became the new prime minister.[80] He formed a government coalition of the alliance SPOLU (Civic Democratic Party, KDU-ČSL and TOP 09) and the alliance of Pirates and Mayors. In January 2023, retired general Petr Pavel won the presidential election, becoming new Czech president to succeed Miloš Zeman.[81] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country took in half a million Ukrainian refugees, the largest number per capita in the world.[82][83]\n\nThe Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes 48° and 51° N and longitudes 12° and 19° E.\n\nBohemia, to the west, consists of a basin drained by the Elbe (Czech: Labe) and the Vltava rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the Krkonoše range of the Sudetes. The highest point in the country, Sněžka at 1,603 m (5,259 ft), is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also hilly. It is drained mainly by the Morava River, but it also contains the source of the Oder River (Czech: Odra).\n\nWater from the Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and Black Sea. The Czech Republic also leases the Moldauhafen, a 30,000-square-meter (7.4-acre) lot in the middle of the Hamburg Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the Treaty of Versailles, to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.\n\nPhytogeographically, the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region, within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Western European broadleaf forests, Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.[84]\n\nThere are four national parks in the Czech Republic. The oldest is Krkonoše National Park (Biosphere Reserve), and the others are Šumava National Park (Biosphere Reserve), Podyjí National Park, and Bohemian Switzerland.\n\nThe three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly some countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond with the river basins of the Elbe and the Vltava basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).\n\nThe Czech Republic has a temperate climate, situated in the transition zone between the oceanic and continental climate types, with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is due to the landlocked geographical position.[85]\n\nTemperatures vary depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and precipitation increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around Bílý Potok in Jizera Mountains and the driest region is the Louny District to the northwest of Prague. Another factor is the distribution of the mountains.\n\nAt the highest peak of Sněžka (1,603 m or 5,259 ft), the average temperature is −0.4 °C (31 °F), whereas in the lowlands of the South Moravian Region, the average temperature is as high as 10 °C (50 °F). The country's capital, Prague, has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.\n\nThe coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is snow in the mountains and sometimes in the cities and lowlands. During March, April, and May, the temperature usually increases, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary during the day. Spring is also characterized by higher water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.\n\nThe warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about 20–30 °C (36–54 °F) higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.\n\nAutumn generally begins in September, which is still warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below 15 °C (59 °F) or 10 °C (50 °F) and deciduous trees begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.\n\nThe coldest temperature ever measured was in Litvínovice near České Budějovice in 1929, at −42.2 °C (−44.0 °F) and the hottest measured, was at 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) in Dobřichovice in 2012.[86]\n\nMost rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1 mm (0.0039 in) of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated rainfall (days with more than 10 mm (0.39 in) per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).[87] Severe thunderstorms, producing damaging straight-line winds, hail, and occasional tornadoes occur, especially during the summer period.[88][89]\n\nAs of 2020, the Czech Republic ranks as the 21st most environmentally conscious country in the world in Environmental Performance Index.[90] It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.71/10, ranking it 160th globally out of 172 countries.[91] The Czech Republic has four National Parks (Šumava National Park, Krkonoše National Park, České Švýcarsko National Park, Podyjí National Park) and 25 Protected Landscape Areas. The fauna of the Czech Republic includes a wide variety of animal species. Some species (especially endangered ones) are bred in reserves. Among the rare animals are, for example, eagles, ospreys, bustards, and storks.[92]\n\nThe Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party parliamentary representative democracy. The Parliament (Parlament České republiky) is bicameral, with the Chamber of Deputies (Czech: Poslanecká sněmovna, 200 members) and the Senate (Czech: Senát, 81 members).[93] The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term by proportional representation, with a 5% election threshold. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the Czech National Council, has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia. The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat constituencies by two-round runoff voting for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. This arrangement is modeled on the U.S. Senate, but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff.\n\nThe president is a formal head of state with limited and specific powers, who appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 1993 until 2012, the President of the Czech Republic was selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms (Václav Havel and Václav Klaus were both elected twice). Since 2013, the president has been elected directly.[94] Some commentators have argued that, with the introduction of direct election of the President, the Czech Republic has moved away from the parliamentary system and towards a semi-presidential one.[95] The Government's exercise of executive power derives from the Constitution. The members of the government are the Prime Minister, Deputy prime ministers and other ministers. The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.[96] The Prime Minister is the head of government and wields powers such as the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy and choose government ministers.[97]\n\nThe Czech Republic is a unitary state,[98] with a civil law system based on the continental type, rooted in Germanic legal culture. The basis of the legal system is the Constitution of the Czech Republic adopted in 1993.[99] The Penal Code is effective from 2010. A new Civil code became effective in 2014. The court system includes district, county, and supreme courts and is divided into civil, criminal, and administrative branches. The Czech judiciary has a triumvirate of supreme courts. The Constitutional Court consists of 15 constitutional judges and oversees violations of the Constitution by either the legislature or by the government.[99] The Supreme Court is formed of 67 judges and is the court of highest appeal for most legal cases heard in the Czech Republic. The Supreme Administrative Court decides on issues of procedural and administrative propriety. It also has jurisdiction over certain political matters, such as the formation and closure of political parties, jurisdictional boundaries between government entities, and the eligibility of persons to stand for public office.[99] The Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court are both based in Brno, as is the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office.[99]\n\nThe Czech Republic has ranked as one of the safest or most peaceful countries for the past few decades.[100] It is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, OECD, Council of Europe and is an observer to the Organization of American States.[101] The embassies of most countries with diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic are located in Prague, while consulates are located across the country.\n\nThe Czech passport is restricted by visas. According to the 2018 Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index, Czech citizens have visa-free access to 173 countries, which ranks them 7th along with Malta and New Zealand.[102] The World Tourism Organization ranks the Czech passport 24th.[103] The US Visa Waiver Program applies to Czech nationals.\n\nThe Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs have primary roles in setting foreign policy, although the President also has influence and represents the country abroad. Membership in the European Union and NATO is central to the Czech Republic's foreign policy. The Office for Foreign Relations and Information (ÚZSI) serves as the foreign intelligence agency responsible for espionage and foreign policy briefings, as well as protection of Czech Republic's embassies abroad.\n\nThe Czech Republic has ties with Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as a member of the Visegrád Group,[104] as well as with Germany,[105] Israel,[106] the United States[107] and the European Union and its members. After 2020, relations with Asian democratic states, such as Taiwan, are being strengthened.[108] Conversely, the Czech Republic has long had bad relations with Russia; from 2021, the Czech Republic appears on Russia's official list of enemy countries.[109] The Czech Republic also has problematic relations with China.\n\nCzech officials have supported dissenters in Belarus, Moldova, Myanmar and Cuba.[110]\n\nFamous Czech diplomats of the past included Jaroslav Lev of Rožmitál, Humprecht Jan Czernin, Count Philip Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau, Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg, Prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg, Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal, Ottokar Czernin, Edvard Beneš, Jan Masaryk, Jiří Hájek, Jiří Dienstbier, Michael Žantovský, Petr Kolář, Alexandr Vondra, Prince Karel Schwarzenberg and Petr Pavel.\n\nThe Czech armed forces consist of the Czech Land Forces, the Czech Air Force and of specialized support units. The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence. The President of the Czech Republic is Commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In 2004 the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The country has been a member of NATO since 12 March 1999. Defence spending is approximately 1.28% of the GDP (2021).[111] The armed forces are charged with protecting the Czech Republic and its allies, promoting global security interests, and contributing to NATO.\n\nCurrently, as a member of NATO, the Czech military are participating in the Resolute Support and KFOR operations and have soldiers in Afghanistan, Mali, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Egypt, Israel and Somalia. The Czech Air Force also served in the Baltic states and Iceland.[112] The main equipment of the Czech military includes JAS 39 Gripen multi-role fighters, Aero L-159 Alca combat aircraft, AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters, armored vehicles (Pandur II, BVP-2) and tanks (T-72M4CZ and Leopard 2A4).\n\nHuman rights in the Czech Republic are guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and international treaties on human rights. Nevertheless, there were cases of human rights violations such as discrimination against Roma children,[113] for which the European Commission asked the Czech Republic to provide an explanation,[114] or the illegal sterilization of Roma women,[115] for which the government apologized.[116]\n\nPeople of the same sex can enter into a \"registered partnership\" in the Czech Republic. Conducting same-sex marriage is not legal under current Czech law.[117]\n\nSince 2000, the Czech Republic has been divided into thirteen regions (Czech: kraje, singular kraj) and the capital city of Prague. Every region has its own elected regional assembly and a regional governor. In Prague, the assembly and presidential powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.\n\nThe older seventy-six districts (okresy, singular okres) including three \"statutory cities\" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.[118]\n\nThe smallest administrative units are obce (municipalities). As of 2021, the Czech Republic is divided into 6,254 municipalities. Cities and towns are also municipalities. The capital city of Prague is a region and municipality at the same time.\n\nThe Czech Republic has a developed,[119] high-income[120] export-oriented social market economy based in services, manufacturing and innovation, that maintains a welfare state and the European social model.[121] The Czech Republic participates in the European Single Market as a member of the European Union and is therefore a part of the economy of the European Union, but uses its own currency, the Czech koruna, instead of the euro. It has a per capita GDP rate that is 91% of the EU average[122] and is a member of the OECD. Monetary policy is conducted by the Czech National Bank, whose independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. The Czech Republic ranks 12th in the UN inequality-adjusted human development and 24th in World Bank Human Capital Index. It was described by The Guardian as \"one of Europe's most flourishing economies\".[123]\n\nAs of 2023 , the country's GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is $51,329[124] and $29,856 at nominal value.[125] According to Allianz A.G., in 2018 the country was an MWC (mean wealth country), ranking 26th in net financial assets.[126] The country experienced a 4.5% GDP growth in 2017.[127] The 2016 unemployment rate was the lowest in the EU at 2.4%,[128] and the 2016 poverty rate was the second lowest of OECD members.[129] Czech Republic ranks 27th in the 2021 Index of Economic Freedom,[130] 30th in the 2024 Global Innovation Index,[131] 29th in the Global Competitiveness Report,[132] and 25th in the Global Enabling Trade Report.[133] The Czech Republic has a diverse economy that ranks 7th in the 2016 Economic Complexity Index.[134] The industrial sector accounts for 37.5% of the economy, while services account for 60% and agriculture for 2.5%.[135] The largest trading partner for both export and import is Germany and the EU in general. Dividends worth CZK 270 billion were paid to the foreign owners of Czech companies in 2017, which has become a political issue.[136] The country has been a member of the Schengen Area since 1 May 2004, having abolished border controls, completely opening its borders with all of its neighbors on 21 December 2007.[137]\n\nIn 2018 the largest companies by revenue in the Czech Republic were: automobile manufacturer Škoda Auto, utility company ČEZ Group, conglomerate Agrofert, energy trading company EPH, oil processing company Unipetrol, electronics manufacturer Foxconn CZ and steel producer Moravia Steel.[138] Other Czech transportation companies include: Škoda Transportation (tramways, trolleybuses, metro), Tatra (heavy trucks, the second oldest car maker in the world), Avia (medium trucks), Karosa and SOR Libchavy (buses), Aero Vodochody (military aircraft), Let Kunovice (civil aircraft), Zetor (tractors), Jawa Moto (motorcycles) and Čezeta (electric scooters).\n\nŠkoda Transportation is the fourth largest tram producer in the world; nearly one third of all trams in the world come from Czech factories.[139] The Czech Republic is also the world's largest vinyl records manufacturer, with GZ Media producing about 6 million pieces annually in Loděnice.[140] Česká zbrojovka is among the ten largest firearms producers in the world and five who produce automatic weapons.[141]\n\nIn the food industry, Czech companies include Agrofert, Kofola and Hamé.\n\nProduction of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 TWh per year, the excess being exported. Nuclear power presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by nuclear plants; and 4.6 percent came from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is Temelín Nuclear Power Station, with another nuclear power plant in Dukovany.\n\nThe Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade brown coal as a source of energy. Natural gas is purchased from Norwegian companies and as liquefied gas LNG from the Netherlands and Belgium. In the past, three-quarters of gas supplies came from Russia, but after the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government gradually stopped these supplies.[142] Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption. South Moravia has small oil and gas deposits.\n\nAs of 2020, the road network in the Czech Republic is 55,768.3 kilometers (34,652.82 mi) long, out of which 1,276.4 km (793.1 mi) are motorways.[143] The speed limit is 50 km/h (31 mph) within towns, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside of towns and 130 km/h (81 mph) on motorways.[144]\n\nThe Czech Republic has one of the densest rail networks in the world. As of 2020, the country has 9,542 kilometers (5,929 mi) of lines. Of that number, 3,236 km (2,011 mi) is electrified, 7,503 km (4,662 mi) are single-line tracks and 2,040 km (1,270 mi) are double and multiple-line tracks.[145] The length of tracks is 15,360 km (9,540 mi), out of which 6,917 km (4,298 mi) is electrified.[146]\n\nČeské dráhy (the Czech Railways) is the main railway operator in the country, with about 180 million passengers carried yearly. Maximum speed is limited to 160 km/h (99 mph).\n\nVáclav Havel Airport in Prague is the main international airport in the country. In 2019, it handled 17.8 million passengers.[147] In total, the Czech Republic has 91 airports, six of which provide international air services. The public international airports are in Brno, Karlovy Vary, Mnichovo Hradiště, Mošnov (near Ostrava), Pardubice and Prague.[148] The non-public international airports capable of handling airliners are in Kunovice and Vodochody.[149]\n\nRussia (via pipelines through Ukraine) and, to a lesser extent, Norway (via pipelines through Germany) supply the Czech Republic with liquid and natural gas.[150]\n\nThe Czech Republic ranks in the top 10 countries worldwide with the fastest average internet speed.[151] By the beginning of 2008, there were over 800 mostly local WISPs,[152][153] with about 350,000 subscribers in 2007. Plans based on either GPRS, EDGE, UMTS or CDMA2000 are being offered by all three mobile phone operators (T-Mobile, O2, Vodafone) and internet provider U:fon. Government-owned Český Telecom slowed down broadband penetration. At the beginning of 2004, local-loop unbundling began and alternative operators started to offer ADSL and also SDSL. This and later privatization of Český Telecom helped drive down prices.\n\nOn 1 July 2006, Český Telecom was acquired by globalized company (Spain-owned) Telefónica group and adopted the new name Telefónica O2 Czech Republic. As of 2017 , VDSL and ADSL2+ are offered in variants, with download speeds of up to 50 Mbit/s and upload speeds of up to 5 Mbit/s. Cable internet is gaining more popularity with its higher download speeds ranging from 50 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.\n\nTwo computer security companies, Avast and AVG, were founded in the Czech Republic. In 2016, Avast led by Pavel Baudiš bought rival AVG for US$1.3 billion, together at the time, these companies had a user base of about 400 million people and 40% of the consumer market outside of China.[154][155] Avast is the leading provider of antivirus software, with a 20.5% market share.[156]\n\nPrague is the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome.[157] In 2001, the total earnings from tourism reached 118 billion CZK, making up 5.5% of the country's GNP and 9% of its overall export earnings. The industry employs more than 110,000 people – over 1% of the population.[158] Guidebooks and tourists reporting overcharging by taxi drivers and pickpocketing problems talk mainly about Prague, though the situation has improved recently.[159][160] Since 2005, Prague's mayor, Pavel Bém, has worked to improve this reputation by cracking down on petty crime[160] and, aside from these problems, Prague is a \"safe\" city.[161] The Czech Republic's crime rate is described by the United States State department as \"low\".[162]\n\nThe Czech Republic boasts 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 3 of them being transnational. As of 2024 , further 13 sites are on the tentative list.[163]\n\nArchitectural heritage is an object of interest to visitors – it includes castles and châteaux from different historical epochs, namely Karlštejn Castle, Český Krumlov and the Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape. There are 12 cathedrals and 15 churches elevated to the rank of basilica by the Pope, as well as many monasteries.\n\nAway from the towns, areas such as Bohemian Paradise, Bohemian Forest and the Giant Mountains attract visitors seeking outdoor pursuits.\n\nThe country is also known for its various museums, puppetry and marionette exhibitions that take part within larger puppet festivals, and beer festivals.[164] Aquapalace Prague in Čestlice is the largest water park in the country.\n\nThe Czech lands have a long and well-documented history of scientific innovation.[165][166] Today, the Czech Republic has a highly sophisticated, developed, high-performing, innovation-oriented scientific community supported by the government,[167] industry,[168] and leading universities.[169] Czech scientists are embedded members of the global scientific community.[170] They contribute annually to multiple international academic journals and collaborate with their colleagues across boundaries and fields.[171][172][173][174] The Czech Republic was ranked 24th in the Global Innovation Index in 2020 and 2021, up from 26th in 2019.[175][176][177]\n\nHistorically, the Czech lands, especially Prague, have been the seat of scientific discovery going back to early modern times, including Tycho Brahe, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Johannes Kepler. In 1784 the scientific community was first formally organized under the charter of the Royal Czech Society of Sciences. Currently, this organization is known as the Czech Academy of Sciences.[178] Similarly, the Czech lands have a well-established history of scientists,[179][180] including Nobel laureates biochemists Gerty and Carl Ferdinand Cori, chemists Jaroslav Heyrovský and Otto Wichterle, physicists Ernst Mach and Peter Grünberg, physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkyně and chemist Antonín Holý.[181] Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was born in Příbor,[182] Gregor Mendel, the founder of genetics, was born in Hynčice and spent most of his life in Brno,[183] logician and mathematician Kurt Gödel was born in Brno.\n\nHistorically, most scientific research was recorded in Latin, but from the 18th century onwards increasingly in German and later in Czech, archived in libraries supported and managed by religious groups and other denominations as evidenced by historical locations of international renown and heritage such as the Strahov Monastery and the Clementinum in Prague. Increasingly, Czech scientists publish their work and that of their history in English.[184][185]\n\nThe current important scientific institution is the already mentioned Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the CEITEC Institute in Brno or the HiLASE and Eli Beamlines centers with the most powerful laser in the world in Dolní Břežany. Prague is the seat of the administrative center of the GSA Agency operating the European navigation system Galileo and the European Union Agency for the Space Programme.\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2020 was estimated at 1.71 children per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.[186] The Czech Republic's population has an average age of 43.3 years.[187] The life expectancy in 2021 was estimated to be 79.5 years (76.55 years male, 82.61 years female).[188] About 77,000 people immigrate to the Czech Republic annually.[189] Vietnamese immigrants began settling in the country during the Communist period, when they were invited as guest workers by the Czechoslovak government.[190] In 2009, there were about 70,000 Vietnamese in the Czech Republic.[191] Most decide to stay in the country permanently.[192]\n\nAccording to results of the 2021 census, the majority of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic are Czechs (57.3%), followed by Moravians (3.4%), Slovaks (0.9%), Ukrainians (0.7%), Viets (0.3%), Poles (0.3%), Russians (0.2%), Silesians (0.1%) and Germans (0.1%). Another 4.0% declared combination of two nationalities (3.6% combination of Czech and other nationality). As the 'nationality' was an optional item, a number of people left this field blank (31.6%).[4] According to some estimates, there are about 250,000 Romani people in the Czech Republic.[193][194] The Polish minority resides mainly in the Trans-Olza region.[195]\n\nThere were 658,564 foreigners residing in the country in 2021,[196] according to the Czech Statistical Office, with the largest groups being Ukrainian (22%), Slovak (22%), Vietnamese (12%), Russian (7%) and German (4%). Most of the foreign population lives in Prague (37.3%) and Central Bohemia Region (13.2%).[197]\n\nThe Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia, 118,000 according to the 1930 census, was nearly annihilated by the Nazi Germans during the Holocaust.[198] There were approximately 3,900 Jews in the Czech Republic in 2021.[199] The former Czech prime minister, Jan Fischer, is of Jewish faith.[200]\n\nNationality of residents, who answered the question in the Census 2021:[201][202]\n\nAbout 75%[205] to 79%[206] of residents of the Czech Republic do not declare having any religion or faith in surveys, and the proportion of convinced atheists (30%) is the third highest in the world behind those of China (47%) and Japan (31%).[207][unreliable source?] The Czech people have been historically characterized as \"tolerant and even indifferent towards religion\".[208] The religious identity of the country has changed drastically since the first half of the 20th century, when more than 90% of Czechs were Christians.[209]\n\nChristianization in the 9th and 10th centuries introduced Christianity. After the Bohemian Reformation, most Czechs became followers of Jan Hus, Petr Chelčický and other regional Protestant Reformers. Taborites and Utraquists were Hussite groups. Towards the end of the Hussite Wars, the Utraquists changed sides and allied with the Roman Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist—Roman Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in Bohemia by the Roman Catholic Church while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the Reformation, some Bohemians went with the teachings of Martin Luther, especially Sudeten Germans. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly anti-Catholic stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions were revived. After the Habsburgs regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism—even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A history of resistance to the Roman Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite Czechoslovak Hussite Church in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing secularization. Protestantism never recovered after the Counter-Reformation was introduced by the Austrian Habsburgs in 1620. Prior to the Holocaust, the Czech Republic had a sizable Jewish community of around 100,000. There are many historically important and culturally relevant Synagogues in the Czech Republic such as Europe's oldest active Synagogue, The Old New Synagogue and the second largest Synagogue in Europe, the Great Synagogue (Plzeň). The Holocaust decimated Czech Jewry and the Jewish population as of 2021 is 3,900.[210]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% were Roman Catholic, 0.8% were Protestant (0.5% Czech Brethren and 0.4% Hussite),[211] and 9% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are Pagan). 45% of the population did not answer the question about religion.[204] From 1991 to 2001 and further to 2011 the adherence to Roman Catholicism decreased from 39% to 27% and then to 10%; Protestantism similarly declined from 3.7% to 2% and then to 0.8%.[212] The Muslim population is estimated to be 20,000 representing 0.2% of the population.[213]\n\nThe proportion of religious believers varies significantly across the country, from 55% in Zlín Region to 16% in Ústí nad Labem Region.[214]\n\nEducation in the Czech Republic is compulsory for nine years and citizens have access to a free-tuition university education, while the average number of years of education is 13.1.[215] Additionally, the Czech Republic has a \"relatively equal\" educational system in comparison with other countries in Europe.[215] Founded in 1348, Charles University was the first university in Central Europe. Other major universities in the country are Masaryk University, Czech Technical University, Palacký University, Academy of Performing Arts and University of Economics.\n\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks the Czech education system as the 15th most successful in the world, higher than the OECD average.[216] The UN Education Index ranks the Czech Republic 10th as of 2013 (positioned behind Denmark and ahead of South Korea).[217]\n\nHealth care in the Czech Republic is similar in quality to that of other developed nations. The Czech universal health care system is based on a compulsory insurance model, with fee-for-service care funded by mandatory employment-related insurance plans.[218] According to the 2016 Euro health consumer index, a comparison of healthcare in Europe, the Czech healthcare is 13th, ranked behind Sweden and two positions ahead of the United Kingdom.[219]\n\nVenus of Dolní Věstonice is an important example of prehistoric art unearthed in the Czech Republic. Theodoric of Prague was a painter in the Gothic era who decorated the castle Karlštejn. In the Baroque era, there were painters Wenceslaus Hollar, Jan Kupecký, Karel Škréta, Anton Raphael Mengs and Petr Brandl and sculptors Matthias Braun and Ferdinand Brokoff.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, Josef Mánes joined the romantic movement. In the second half the so-called \"National Theatre generation\" rose to prominence: sculptor Josef Václav Myslbek and painters Mikoláš Aleš, Václav Brožík, Vojtěch Hynais and Julius Mařák. At the end of the century came Art Nouveau, with Alfons Mucha becoming its main representative. He is known for his Art Nouveau posters and a cycle of 20 large canvases named the Slav Epic, which depicts the history of Czechs and other Slavs. As of 2012 , it can be seen in the Veletržní Palace of the National Gallery in Prague, which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. Max Švabinský was another Art Nouveau painter.\n\nThe 20th century brought an avant-garde revolution, represented in the Czech lands mainly by expressionists and cubists: Josef Čapek, Emil Filla, Bohumil Kubišta or Jan Zrzavý. Surrealism emerged particularly through the work of Toyen, Josef Šíma and Karel Teige. In the world, however, the most well-known Czech avant-garde artist might be František Kupka, a pioneer of abstract painting. Illustrators and cartoonists to gain fame in the first half of the 20th century include Josef Lada, Zdeněk Burian or Emil Orlík. Art photography became a new field represented by František Drtikol, Josef Sudek, later Jan Saudek and Josef Koudelka.\n\nThe Czech Republic is also known for its individually made, mouth-blown, and decorated Bohemian glass.\n\nThe earliest preserved stone buildings in Bohemia and Moravia date back to the time of the Christianization in the 9th and 10th centuries. Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of Western and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the Romanesque style. During the 13th century, it was replaced by the Gothic style. In the 14th century, Emperor Charles IV invited architects from France and Germany, Matthias of Arras and Peter Parler, to his court in Prague. During the Middle Ages, some fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as some monasteries.\n\nThe Renaissance style penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be mixed with Renaissance elements. An example of pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the Queen Anne's Summer Palace, which was situated in the garden of Prague Castle. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving an influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious chateaus with arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens.[220] Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.[221]\n\nIn the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia.[222]\n\nIn the 18th century, Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity – the Baroque Gothic style, a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles.[220]\n\nDuring the 19th century stands the revival architectural styles. Some churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed buildings in the Neo-Romanesque, Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance styles. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the new art style appeared in the Czech lands – Art Nouveau.\n\nBohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the Cubism of painting and sculpture into architecture.\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, Functionalism, with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style.[220]\n\nAfter World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became Soviet-influenced. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement is known as the Brussels style came up in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. Brutalism dominated in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Czech Republic is not shying away from the more modern trends of international architecture, an example is the Dancing House (Tančící dům) in Prague, Golden Angel in Prague or Congress Centre in Zlín.[220]\n\nThe literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in Latin and German or even Old Church Slavonic. Franz Kafka, although a competent user of Czech, wrote in his mother tongue, German.[223][224] His works include The Trial and The Castle.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of German Minnesang and courtly literature. The Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nBible translations played a role in the development of Czech literature. The oldest Czech translation of the Psalms originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488. The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593. The Codex Gigas from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.[225]\n\nCzech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the Renaissance humanism; the Baroque period; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century, modern literature in the second half of the 19th century; the avant-garde of the interwar period; the years under Communism; and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe antiwar comedy novel The Good Soldier Švejk is the most translated Czech book in history.\n\nThe international literary award the Franz Kafka Prize is awarded in the Czech Republic.[226]\n\nThe Czech Republic has the densest network of libraries in Europe.[227]\n\nCzech literature and culture played a role on at least two occasions when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.[228]\n\nThe musical tradition of the Czech lands arose from the first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of the 10th and 11th centuries. Some pieces of Czech music include two chorales, which in their time performed the function of anthems: \"Lord, Have Mercy on Us\" and the hymn \"Saint Wenceslaus\" or \"Saint Wenceslaus Chorale\".[229] The authorship of the anthem \"Lord, Have Mercy on Us\" is ascribed by some historians to Saint Adalbert of Prague (sv.Vojtěch), bishop of Prague, living between 956 and 997.[230]\n\nThe wealth of musical culture lies in the classical music tradition during all historical periods, especially in the Baroque, Classicism, Romantic, modern classical music and in the traditional folk music of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. Since the early era of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have been influenced the folk music of the region and dance.\n\nCzech music can be considered to have been \"beneficial\" in both the European and worldwide context, several times co-determined or even determined a newly arriving era in musical art,[231] above all of Classical era, as well as by original attitudes in Baroque, Romantic and modern classical music. Some Czech musical works are The Bartered Bride, New World Symphony, Sinfonietta and Jenůfa.\n\nA music festival in the country is Prague Spring International Music Festival of classical music, a permanent showcase for performing artists, symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles of the world.\n\nThe roots of Czech theatre can be found in the Middle Ages, especially in the cultural life of the Gothic period. In the 19th century, the theatre played a role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century, it became a part of modern European theatre art. The original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called Laterna magika, resulting in productions that combined theater, dance, and film in a poetic manner, considered the first multimedia art project in an international context.\n\nOne drama is Karel Čapek's play R.U.R., which introduced the word \"robot\".[232]\n\nThe country has a tradition of puppet theater. In 2016, Czech and Slovak Puppetry was included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[233]\n\nThe tradition of Czech cinematography started in the second half of the 1890s. Peaks of the production in the era of silent movies include the historical drama The Builder of the Temple and the social and erotic drama Erotikon directed by Gustav Machatý.[234] The early Czech sound film era was productive, above all in mainstream genres, with the comedies of Martin Frič or Karel Lamač. There were dramatic movies sought internationally.[citation needed]\n\nHermína Týrlová was a prominent Czech animator, screenwriter, and film director. She was often called the mother of Czech animation. Over the course of her career, she produced over 60 animated children's short films using puppets and the technique of stop motion animation.[citation needed]\n\nBefore the German occupation, in 1933, filmmaker and animator Irena Dodalová [cs] established the first Czech animation studio \"IRE Film\" with her husband Karel Dodal.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the period of Nazi occupation and early communist official dramaturgy of socialist realism in movies at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s with fewer exceptions such as Krakatit or Men without wings (awarded by Palme d'Or in 1946), an era of the Czech film began with animated films, performed in anglophone countries under the name \"The Fabulous World of Jules Verne\" from 1958, which combined acted drama with animation, and Jiří Trnka, the founder of the modern puppet film.[235] This began a tradition of animated films (Mole etc.).\n\nIn the 1960s, the hallmark of Czechoslovak New Wave's films were improvised dialogues, black and absurd humor and the occupation of non-actors. Directors are trying to preserve natural atmosphere without refinement and artificial arrangement of scenes. A personality of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s with original manuscript and psychological impact is František Vláčil. Another international author is Jan Švankmajer, a filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media. He is a self-labeled surrealist known for animations and features.[236]\n\nThe Barrandov Studios in Prague are the largest film studios with film locations in the country.[237] Filmmakers have come to Prague to shoot scenery no longer found in Berlin, Paris and Vienna. The city of Karlovy Vary was used as a location for the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale.[238]\n\nThe Czech Lion is the highest Czech award for film achievement. Karlovy Vary International Film Festival is one of the film festivals that have been given competitive status by the FIAPF. Other film festivals held in the country include Febiofest, Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival, One World Film Festival, Zlín Film Festival and Fresh Film Festival.\n\nCzech journalists and media enjoy a degree of freedom. There are restrictions against writing in support of Nazism, racism or violating Czech law. The Czech press was ranked as the 40th most free press in the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders in 2021.[239] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has its headquarters in Prague.\n\nCzech Television is the country's national public television broadcaster. It operates a number of channels, including ČT1, ČT2, and the 24-hour news channel ČT24, as well as the news website ct24.cz. As of 2020, it is the most watched broadcaster, followed by the private TV Nova and Prima TV. However, TV Nova features the most watched main news program and prime time program.[240] Other public media services include the Czech Radio and the Czech News Agency.\n\nThe best-selling daily national newspapers in 2020/21 are Blesk (average 703,000 daily readers), Mladá fronta DNES (average 461,000 daily readers), Právo (average 182,000 daily readers), Lidové noviny (average 163,000 daily readers) and Hospodářské noviny (average 162,000 daily readers).[241]\n\nMost Czechs (87%[242]) read their news online,[243] with Seznam.cz, iDNES.cz, Novinky.cz, iPrima.cz and Seznam Zprávy.cz being the most visited as of 2021.[244]\n\nCzech cuisine is marked by an emphasis on meat dishes with pork, beef, and chicken. Goose, duck, rabbit, and venison are served. Fish is less common, with the occasional exception of fresh trout and carp, which is served at Christmas.[245][246] One popular Czech menu item is smažený vepřový řízek (fried breaded pork filet), served with boiled potatoes.[247]\n\nThere is a variety of local sausages, wurst, pâtés, and smoked and cured meats. Czech desserts include a variety of whipped cream, chocolate, and fruit pastries and tarts, crêpes, creme desserts and cheese, poppy-seed-filled and other types of traditional cakes such as buchty, koláče and štrúdl.[248]\n\nCzech beer has a history extending more than a millennium; the earliest known brewery existed in 993. Today, the Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world. The pilsner style beer (pils) originated in Plzeň, where the world's first blond lager Pilsner Urquell is still produced. It has served as the inspiration for more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today. The city of České Budějovice has similarly lent its name to its beer, known as Budweiser Budvar.\n\nThe South Moravian region has been producing wine since the Middle Ages; about 94% of vineyards in the Czech Republic are Moravian. Aside from beer, slivovitz and wine, the Czech Republic also produces two liquors, Fernet Stock and Becherovka. Kofola is a non-alcoholic domestic cola soft drink which competes with Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nThe most watched and most attended sport in the Czech Republic are football and ice hockey.[250] The most watched sporting events are the Ice hockey at the Olympic Games and the Ice Hockey World Championships.[251][252] The most popular sports in the Czech Republic according to the size of the membership base of sports clubs are: football, tennis, ice hockey, volleyball, floorball, golf, ball hockey, athletics, basketball and skiing.[253]\n\nThe country has won 15 gold medals in the Summer Olympics and nine in the Winter Games. (See Olympic history.) The Czech ice hockey team won the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics and has won (along with the Czechoslovakian team) thirteen gold medals at the World Championships, including three straight from 1999 to 2001.[254]\n\nThe Škoda Motorsport is engaged in competition racing since 1901 and has gained a number of titles with various vehicles around the world. MTX automobile company was formerly engaged in the manufacture of racing and formula cars since 1969.[255]\n\nHiking is a popular sport. The word for 'tourist' in Czech, turista, also means 'trekker' or 'hiker'. For hikers, thanks to the more than 120-year-old tradition, there is the Czech Hiking Markers System of trail blazing, that has been adopted by countries worldwide. There is a network of around 40,000 km of marked short- and long-distance trails crossing the whole country and all the Czech mountains.[256][257]\n• #VisitCzechia – official tourist portal of the Czech RepublicSudetes - Wikipedia: Mountain range in Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic\n\nThe Sudetes ( soo-DEE-teez), also known as the Sudeten Mountains or Sudetic Mountains, is a geomorphological subprovince of the Bohemian Massif province in Central Europe, shared by the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany. They consist mainly of mountain ranges and are the highest part of Bohemian Massif. They stretch from the Saxon capital of Dresden in the northwest across to the region of Lower Silesia in Poland and to the Moravian Gate in the Czech Republic in the east. Geographically the Sudetes are a Mittelgebirge with some characteristics typical of high mountains.[1] Its plateaus and subtle summit relief makes the Sudetes more akin to mountains of Northern Europe than to the Alps.[1]\n\nIn the east of the Sudetes, the Moravian Gate and Ostrava Basin separates from the Carpathian Mountains. The Sudetes' highest mountain is Mount Sněžka/Śnieżka 1,603 m (5,259 ft), which is also the highest mountain of the Czech Republic, Bohemia, Silesia, and Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in the Giant Mountains, lying on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland. Mount Praděd (1,491 m/4,893 ft) in the Hrubý Jeseník mountains is the highest mountain of Moravia. Lusatia's highest point (1,072 m/3,517 ft) lies on Mount Smrk/Smrek in the Jizera Mountains, and the Sudetes' highest mountain in Germany, which is also the country's highest mountain east of the river Elbe, is Mount Lausche/Luž (793 m/2,600 ft) in the Zittau Mountains, the highest part of the Lusatian Mountains. The most notable rivers rising in the Sudetes are Elbe, Oder, Spree, Morava, Bóbr, Lusatian Neisse, Eastern Neisse, Jizera and Kwisa. The highest parts of the Sudetes are protected by national parks;[2] Karkonosze and Stołowe (Table) in Poland and Krkonoše in the Czech Republic.\n\nIn the west, the Sudetes border with the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The westernmost point of the Sudetes lies in the Dresden Heath (Dresdner Heide), the westernmost part of the West Lusatian Hill Country and Uplands, in Dresden.\n\nThe Sudeten Germans (the German-speaking inhabitants of Czechoslovakia) as well as the Sudetenland (the border regions of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia they inhabited) are named after the Sudetes.\n\nThe name Sudetes is derived from Sudeti montes, a Latinization of the name Soudeta ore used in the Geographia by the Greco-Roman writer Ptolemy (Book 2, Chapter 10) AD 150 for a range of mountains in Germania in the general region of the modern Czech Republic.\n\nThere is no consensus about which mountains he meant, and he could for example have intended the Ore Mountains, joining the modern Sudetes to their west, or even (according to Schütte) the Bohemian Forest (although this is normally considered to be equivalent to Ptolemy's Gabreta forest).[3] The modern Sudetes are probably Ptolemy's Askiburgion mountains.[4]\n\nPtolemy wrote \"Σούδητα\" in Greek, which is a neuter plural. Latin mons, however, is a masculine, hence Sudeti. The Latin version, and the modern geographical identification, is likely to be a scholastic innovation, as it is not attested in classical Latin literature. The meaning of the name is not known. In one hypothetical derivation, it means Mountains of Wild Boars, relying on Indo-European *su-, \"pig\". A better etymology perhaps is from Latin sudis, plural sudes, \"spines\", which can be used of spiny fish or spiny terrain.\n\nThe Sudetes are usually divided into:\n• Eastern Sudetes, in the Czech Republic and Poland\n• Central Sudetes, in the Czech Republic and Poland\n• Western Sudetes, in Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland\n\nHigh Sudetes (Polish: Wysokie Sudety, Czech: Vysoké Sudety, German: Hochsudeten) is together name for the ranges of Giant Mountains, Hrubý Jeseník and Králický Sněžník Mountains.\n\nThe highest mountains, those located along the Czech-Polish border have annual precipitations around 1500 mm.[5] The Table Mountains that reach 919 m have precipitations ranging from 750 mm at lower locations to 920 mm in the upper parts with July being the rainiest month.[6] Snow cover at the Table Mountains typically last 70 to 95 days depending on altitude.[6]\n\nSettlement, logging and clearance has left forest pockets in the foothills with dense and continuous forest being found in the upper parts of the mountains.[2] Due to logging in the last centuries little remains of the broad-leaf trees like beech, sycamore, ash and littleleaf linden that were once common in the Sudetes. Instead Norway spruce was planted in their place in the early 19th century, in some places amounting to monocultures.[2] To provide more space for spruce plantations various peatlands were drained in the 19th and 20th century.[6] Some spruce plantations have suffered severe damage as the seeds used came from lowland specimens that were not adapted to mountain conditions.[2] Silver fir grow naturally in the Sudetes being more widespread in past times, before clearance since the Late Middle Ages and subsequent industrial pollution reduced the stands.[7]\n\nMany arctic-alpine and alpine vascular plants have a disjunct distribution being notably absent from the central Sudetes despite suitable habitats. Possibly this is the result a warm period during the Holocene (last 10,000 years) which wiped out cold-adapted vascular plants in the medium-sized mountains of the central Sudetes where there was no higher ground that could serve as refugia.[8][A] Besides altitude the distribution of some alpine plants is influenced by soil. This is the case of Aster alpinus that grows preferentially on calcareous ground.[8] Other alpine plants such as Cardamine amara, Epilobium anagallidifolium, Luzula sudetica and Solidago virgaurea occur beyond their altitudinal zonation in very humid areas.[8]\n\nPeatlands are common in the mountains occurring on high plateaus or in valley bottoms. Fens occur at slopes.[6]\n\nThe higher mountains of the Sudetes lie above the timber line which is made up of Norway spruce.[5][9] Spruces in wind-exposed areas display features such as flag tree disposition of branches, tilted stems and elongated stem cross sections.[10] Forest-free areas above the timber line have increased historically by deforestation[8] yet lowering of the timber line by human activity is minimal.[9] Areas above the timber line appear discontinuously as \"islands\" in the Sudetes.[5] In the Giant Mountains the timber line lies at c. 1230 m a.s.l. while to the southeast in the Hrubý Jeseník mountains it lie at c. 1310 m a.s.l.[5] Part of the Hrubý Jeseník mountains have been above the timber line for no less than 5000 years.[5] Mountains rise considerably above the timber line, at most 400 m, a characteristic that sets the Sudetes apart from other Mittelgebirge of Central Europe.[1]\n\nGeological research has been hampered by the multinational geography of the Sudetes with and the limitation of studies to state boundaries.[11][B]\n\nThe igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Sudetes originated during the Variscan orogeny and its aftermath.[12] The Sudetes are the northeasternmost accessible part of Variscan orogen as in the North European Plain the orogen is buried beneath sediments.[13] Plate tectonic movements during the Variscan orogeny assembled together four major and two to three lesser tectonostratigraphic terranes.[14][C] The assemblage of the terranes ought to have involved the closure of at least two ocean basins containing oceanic crust and marine sediments.[15] This is reflected in the ophiolites, MORB-basalts, blueschists and eclogites that occur in-between terranes.[14] Various terranes of the Sudetes are likely extensions of the Armorican terrane while other terranes may be the fringes of the ancient Baltica continent.[13] One possibility for the amalgamation of terranes in the Sudetes is that the Góry Sowie-Kłodzko terrane collided with the Orlica-Śnieżnik terrane causing the closure of a small oceanic basin. This event led to obduction of the Central Sudetic ophiolite in the Devonian period. In the Early Carboniferous the joint Góry Sowie-Kłodzko-Orlica-Śnieżnik terrane collided with the Brunovistulian terrane. This last terrane was part of the Old Red Continent and could correspond either to Baltica or the eastern tip of the narrow Avalonia terrane. Also by the Early Carboniferous the Saxothuringian terrane collided with the Góry Sowie-Kłodzko-Orlica-Śnieżnik terrane closing the Rheic Ocean.[16]\n\nOnce the main phase of deformation of the orogeny was over basins that had formed in-between metamorphic rock massifs were filled by sedimentary rock in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods.[15] During and after sedimentation large granitic plutons intruded the crust. Viewed in a map today these plutons make up about 15% the Sudetes.[12][15] Granites are of S-type.[13] The granites and grantic-gneisses of Izera in the west Sudetes are disassociated from orogeny and thought to have formed during rifting along a passive continental margin.[17][D] The Karkonosze Granite, also in the west Sudetes, have been dated to have formed c. 318 million years ago at the beginning of the Variscan orogeny.[18] The Karkonosze Granite is intruded by somewhat younger lamprophyre dykes.[18]\n\nA NW-SE to WNW-ESE oriented strike-slip fault —the Intra-Sudetic fault— runs through the length of the Sudetes.[15] The Intra-Sudetic fault is parallel with the Upper Elbe fault and Middle Oder fault.[13] Other main faults at the sudetes are also NW-SE oriented, dextral and of strike slip type. These include the Tłumaczów-Sienna Fault and the Marginal Sudetic Fault.[19]\n\nThere are remnants of lava flows and volcanic plugs in the Sudetes.[20] The volcanic rocks making up these outcrops are of mafic chemistry and include basanite and represent episodes of volcanism in the Oligocene and Miocene periods.[20][E] Volcanism affected not only the Sudetes but also parts of the Sudetic foreland being part of a SW-NE oriented Bohemo-Silesian Belt of volcanic rocks.[20] Mantle xenoliths have been recovered from the lavas of a volcano at Ještěd-Kozákov Ridge in the Czech western Sudetes.[21] These pyroxenite xenoliths arrived to surface from approximate depths of 35, 70 and 73 km and indicate a complex history for the mantle beneath the Sudetes.[21]\n\nThere are thermal springs in the Sudetes with measured temperatures of 29 to 44 °C. Drilling has revealed the existence of waters at 87 °C at depths of 2000 m. These modern waters are believed to be associated to the Late Cenozoic volcanism in Central Europe.[22]\n\nThe Sudetes forms the NE border of the Bohemian Massif.[13] In detail the Sudetes is made up of a series of massifs that are rectangular and rhomboid in plan view.[23] These mountains corresponds to horsts and domes separated by basins, including grabens.[24] The mountains took their present form after the Late Mesozoic retreat of the seas from the area which left the Sudetes subject to denudation for at least 65 million years.[23] This meant that during the Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic 8 to 4 km of rock was eroded from the top of what is now the Sudetes.[25] Concurrently with the Cenozoic denudation the climate cooled due to the northward drift of Europe. The collision between Africa and Europe has resulted in the deformation and uplift of the Sudetes.[23] As such the uplift is related to the contemporary rise of the Alps and Carpathians.[23][11][F] The acceleration of uplift of the Sudetes occurred during the Middle Miocene because of the Bohemian Massif's growth.[26] Uplift was accomplished by the creation or reactivation of numerous faults leading to a reshaping of the relief by renewed erosion.[12] Various \"hanging valleys\" attest to this uplift.[11] Block tectonics has uplifted or sunken crustal blocks. While the Late Cenozoic uplift has uplifted the Sudetes as a whole some grabens precede this uplift.[19]\n\nWeathering during the Cenozoic led to the formation of an etchplain in parts of Sudetes. While this etchplain has been eroded various landforms and weathering mantles have been suggested to attest its former existence.[12] At present the mountain range shows a remarkable diversity of landforms.[23] Some of the landforms present are escarpments, inselbergs, bornhardts, granitic domes, tors, flared slopes and weathering pits.[12] Various escarpments have originated from faults and may reach heights of up to 500 m.[11] To the northeast the Sudetes is separated from the Sudetic foreland by a sharp mountain front made up of an escarpment linked to the Sudetic Marginal Fault.[27] Near Kaczawa this escarpment reaches 80 to 120 m in height. The relative influence of Pliocene-Quaternary tectonic movements and erosion in shaping the mountain landscape may vary along the northern front of the Sudetes.[27]\n\nDuring the Quaternary glaciations the Giant Mountains was the most glaciated part of the Sudetes. Evidence of this are its glacial cirques and the glacial valleys that develop next to it.[1] The precise timing of the glaciations in the Sudetes is poorly constrained.[1] Parts of the Sudetes remained free from glacier ice developing permafrost soils and periglacial landforms such as rock glaciers, nivation hollows, patterned ground, blockfields, solifluction landforms, blockstreams, tors and cryoplanation terraces.[9] The occurrence or not of these periglacial landforms depends on altitude, the steepness and direction of slopes and the underlying rock type.[9]\n\nOther than debris flows there is little contemporary mass wasting in the mountains.[1] Avalanches are common in the Sudetes.[1]\n\nThe area around the Sudetes had by the 12th century been relatively densely settled[2] with agriculture and settlements expanding further in the High Middle Ages from the 13th century onward.[6] The majority of settlers were Germans from neighbouring Silesia, founding typical Waldhufendörfer.[28] As this trend went on thinning of forest and deforestation had turned clearly unsustainable by the 14th century.[7] In the 15th and 16th centuries agriculture had reached the inner part of Table Mountains in the Central Sudetes.[2] Destruction and degradation of the Sudetes forest peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries[7] with demand of firewood coming from glasshouses that operated through the area in the early modern period.[2]\n\nSome limited form of forest management begun in the 18th century[7] while in the industrial age demand for firewood was sustained by metallurgic industries in the settlements and cities around the mountains.[2] In the 19th century the Central Sudetes had an economic boom with sandstone quarrying and a flourishing tourism industry centered on the natural scenery. Despite this there was at least since the 1880s a trend of depopulation of villages and hamlets which continued into the 20th century.[29] Since World War II various areas that were cleared of forest have been re-naturalized.[29] Industrial activity across Europe has caused considerable damage to the forests as acid rain and heavy metals has arrived with westerly and southwesterly winds.[2] Silver firs have proven particularly vulnerable to industrial soil contamination.[7]\n\nAfter World War I, the name Sudetenland came into use to describe areas of the First Czechoslovak Republic with large ethnic German populations. In 1918, the short-lived rump state of German-Austria proclaimed a Province of the Sudetenland in northern Moravia and Austrian Silesia around the city of Opava (Troppau).\n\nThe term was used in a wider sense when on 1 October 1933 Konrad Henlein founded the Sudeten German Party and in Nazi German parlance Sudetendeutsche (Sudeten Germans) referred to all autochthonous ethnic Germans in Czechoslovakia. They were heavily clustered in the entire mountainous periphery of Czechoslovakia—not only in the former Moravian Provinz Sudetenland but also along the northwestern Bohemian borderlands with German Lower Silesia, Saxony and Bavaria, in an area formerly called German Bohemia. In total, the German minority population of interwar Czechoslovakia numbered around 20% of the total national population.\n\nSparking the Sudeten Crisis, Adolf Hitler got his future enemies Britain and France to concede the Sudetenland with most of the Czechoslovak border fortifications in the 1938 Munich Agreement, leaving the remainder of Czechoslovakia shorn of its natural borders and buffer zone, finally occupied by Germany in March 1939. After being annexed by Nazi Germany, much of the region was redesignated as the Reichsgau Sudetenland.\n\nAfter World War II, most of the previous population of the Sudetes was forcibly expelled on the basis of the Potsdam Agreement and the Beneš decrees, and the region was resettled by new Polish and Czechoslovak citizens. A considerable proportion of the Czechoslovak populace thereafter strongly objected to the use of the term Sudety. In the Czech Republic the designation Krkonošsko-jesenická subprovincie is used in academic context and usually only the discrete Czech names for the individual mountain ranges (e.g. Giant Mountains) appear, as under Subdivisions above.\n\nPart of the economy of the Sudetes is dedicated to tourism. Coal mining towns like Wałbrzych have re-oriented their economies towards tourism since the decline of mining in the 1980s.[30] As of 2000 scholar Krzysztof R. Mazurski judged that the Sudetes, much like Poland's Baltic coast and the Carpathians, were unlikely to attract much foreign tourism.[30] Sandstone was quarried in Sudetes during the 19th and 20th centuries.[29] Likewise volcanic rock has also been quarried[20] to such degree untouched volcanoes are scarce.[31] Sandstone labyrinths have been a notable tourist attraction since the 19th century with considerable investments being done in projecting trails some of which involve rock engineering.[29]\n\nIn the Sudetes there are many spa towns with sanatoria. In many places the developed tourist base – hotels, guest houses, ski infrastructure.\n\nThe nearest international airports are Dresden Airport in Dresden and Wrocław Airport in Wrocław.\n\nTowns in this area with more than 10,000 inhabitants include:\n• of Germany, Czech Republic, and Poland in the of Germany, Czech Republic, and Poland in the Tripoint of Germany, Czech Republic, and Poland in the Eastern Upper Lusatia"}

Uribe-Uran: Professor Uribe-Uran holds a joint appointment as Associate Professor of History and Law. The recipient of several awards for both teaching and scholarship, including a State University System Teaching Incentive Program Award and a Faculty Senate Award for Excellence in Research, Professor Uribe specializes in Latin American history and law. After earning his law degree at the Universidad Externado de Colombia, he served as a lawyer and then director for the Project of Legal Aid and Legal Research, housed in the Centro de Investigacion y Educacion Popular, Bogotá. Between 2006 and 2009, he served as the Chief of Party in the multi-million dollar initiative “Justice Reform and Modernization Program” implemented by the FIU Center for the Administration of Justice and funded by USAID. This widely successful program finished the implementation of Colombia’s new oral and accusatory criminal justice system, and strengthened access to justice for vulnerable groups of the population, including ethnic minorities and women.\n\nDr. Uribe-Uran also has held faculty appointments at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Seccional Medellín, and as a visiting professor of law at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá. He has received fellowships and research awards from, among others, the Fulbright Program, the Mellon Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities; and has served on the board of editors of journals like the Law and History Review. A prominent and widely-published scholar, Professor Uribe-Uran is the author of over twenty books or book chapters and more than 60 articles and book reviews. In 1997, he received the prestigious Tibesar Prize from the Conference on Latin American History, American Historical Association, for best article published in The Americas. Professor Uribe-Uran is a key figure in the establishment of the College of Law at FIU; his extensive service includes membership on the search and screen committees that recruited the founding faculty and many of the top administrators.\n\n ​Serif Uran: I am currently an advisor for Society of Physics Students (SPS). SPS is a national organization and our university is in Zone 12. Pittsburg State University SPS Chapter has recently been selected as an outstanding chapter. Our chapter has also won two research grant awards (total $4000) from SPS. We are also a member of Sigma Pi Sigma honor society.\n\nMy research interests are mostly in experimental solid state physics. Particularly, I am interested in high temperature oxidation of metals. I use relatively new techniques to characterize native oxide formed at high temperatures on alloys. Native oxide can provide protection for the substrate alloy against further oxidation. Therefore, it is important to retain the oxide layer. I study the stress, thickness change and composition of the oxide film, which give clues about the integrity of the oxide layer.\n\n\n\nI also have an interest in magnetic thin films and electrical/optical characterization of magnetoresistance. Magnetoresistive thin films are of interest due to their potential for computer read heads. Thin (~2 nm) magnetic and non-magnetic (spacer) metal layers can be deposited on substrates (i.e., Silicon, MgO, Sapphire etc.). This structure is called superlattice. By controlling the spacer layer thickness one can change the magnetization of the film from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic. Granular films can also be studied to achieve ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic behavior. Particle size could be an important parameter in this case.\n\n\n\nStudying binary liquid mixtures can give us information about critical phenomenon, which deals with how two different constituents mix under different conditions. Specifically, magnetization can be considered as a critical phenomenon since spin up and spin down electrons can be considered as binary mixture."}

The six pieces, conceived as individual works, are often presented and recorded as a single work in six movements. They premiered separately between 1875 and 1880. The complete set premiered on 5 November 1882 in Žofín Palace, Prague,[4] under Adolf Čech.\n\nMá vlast combines the symphonic poem form, pioneered by Franz Liszt, with the ideals of nationalistic music of the late nineteenth century. Each poem depicts an aspect of Bohemia's countryside, history, or legends.\n\nThe works have opened the Prague Spring International Music Festival, on the 12 May anniversary of the death of their composer, since 1952.[5]\n\nThe first poem, Vyšehrad (The High Castle), composed between the end of September and 18 November 1874 and premiered on 14 March 1875 at the [Prague] Philharmonic,[6] describes the Vyšehrad castle in Prague which was the seat of the earliest Czech kings. During the summer of 1874, Smetana began to lose his hearing, and total deafness soon followed; he described the gradual, but rapid loss of his hearing in a letter of resignation to the director of the Royal Provincial Czech Theatre, Antonín Čížek. In July 1874 he began hearing anomalous noise and then a permanent buzzing. Not long after the onset he was unable to distinguish individual sounds. At the beginning of October he lost all hearing in his right ear, and finally on 20 October in his left. His treatment was based on maintaining isolation from all sounds, but was unsuccessful.[1]\n\nThe poem begins with the sounds of the harp of the mythical singer Lumír, and then crosses over into the tones of the castle's arsenal. This section of the music introduces the main motifs, which are used in other parts of the cycle. A four note motif (B♭–E♭–D–B♭) represents the castle of Vyšehrad; this is heard again at the end of 'Vltava' and once more, to round the whole cycle off, at the conclusion of 'Blaník'.\n\nIn the score two harps are required to perform the opening arpeggios. After a dominant seventh chord, the winds take up the theme, followed by the strings, before the whole orchestra is employed to reach a climax. In the next part, Smetana recalls the story of the castle, using a faster tempo which becomes a march. A seemingly triumphant climax is cut short by a descending passage depicting the collapse of the castle, and the music falls quiet. Then the opening harp material is heard again and the music reminds again of the beauty of the castle, now in ruins. The music ends quietly, depicting the river Vltava flowing below the castle.\n\nConceived between 1872 and 1874, it is the only piece in the cycle to be mostly completed before Smetana began to go noticeably deaf in the summer of 1874. Most performances last approximately fifteen minutes in duration.\n\nVltava, also known by its English title The Moldau, and the German Die Moldau, was composed between 20 November and 8 December 1874 and was premiered on 4 April 1875 under Adolf Čech. It is about 13 minutes long, and is in the key of E minor. It is the most well known of the poems, often performed separately from the full work.\n\nIn this piece, Smetana uses tone painting to evoke the sounds of one of Bohemia's great rivers.[7] In his own words:\n\nVltava contains Smetana's most famous tune. It is an adaptation of the melody La Mantovana, attributed to the Italian Renaissance tenor Giuseppe Cenci,[9] which, in a borrowed Romanian form, was also the basis for the Israeli national anthem Hatikvah. The tune also appears in an old Czech folk song, Kočka leze dírou (\"The Cat Crawls Through the Hole\"); Hanns Eisler used it for his \"Song of the Moldau [de]\"; and Stan Getz performed it as \"Dear Old Stockholm\" (possibly through another derivative of the original tune, \"Ack Värmeland du sköna\"). Horst Jankowski played a syncopated version of the tune on his easy listening hit, \"A Walk in the Black Forest.\"\n\nThe piece is featured in Don Hertzfeldt's short film Everything Will Be OK (2006) and in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life (2011).[10][11]\n\nThe third poem was finished on 20 February 1875 and is named for the female warrior Šárka, a central figure in the ancient Czech legend of The Maidens' War. Šárka ties herself to a tree as bait and waits to be saved by the princely knight Ctirad, deceiving him into believing that she is an unwilling captive of the rebelling women. Once released by Ctirad, who has quickly fallen in love with her, Šárka serves him and his comrades with drugged mead and once they have fallen asleep she sounds a hunting horn: an agreed signal to the other women. The poem ends with the warrior maidens falling upon and murdering the sleeping men. It was first performed under the baton of Adolf Čech (sources disagree whether this was on 10 December 1876[12] or 17 March 1877).[13]\n\nSmetana finished composing this piece, commonly translated as \"From Bohemia's Woods and Fields\" or \"From Bohemian Fields and Groves\",[2][3] on 18 October 1875, and it received its first public performance nearly eight weeks later, on 10 December. A depiction of the beauty of the Czech countryside and its people, the tone poem tells no real story. The first part is dedicated to the grandeur of the forest with a surprising fugue in the strings, interrupted by a soft woodland melody of the horns, which is later taken over by the whole orchestra. In the second part, a village festival is depicted in full swing. This tone poem was originally written to be the finale of Má vlast.\n\nThis piece, which was finished on 13 December 1878 and premiered on 4 January 1880, is named after the town of Tábor in South Bohemia founded by the Hussites and serving as their centre during the Hussite Wars. The theme for the piece is quoted from the first two lines of the Hussite hymn, \"Ktož jsú boží bojovníci\" (\"Ye Who Are Warriors of God\").\n\nBlaník was finished on 9 March 1879 and premiered on 4 January 1880. It is named for the mountain Blaník inside which a legend says that a huge army of knights led by St. Wenceslaus sleep. The knights will awake and help the country in its gravest hour (sometimes described as four hostile armies attacking from all cardinal directions).\n\nMusically, Blaník begins exactly as Tábor ends, \"hammering\" out the motto which was left unresolved, but now continuing on, as if in the aftermath of the battle. Thus these last two tone poems of the cycle form a cohesive pair, as do the first two; the High Castle's theme returns as the Vltava's river journey triumphantly reaches that same destination, and again returns triumphantly at the end of Blaník. Once again, the Hussite hymn used in Tábor is quoted, though this time it is the third line which rings out in the march at the end of the piece. The original lyrics to this line in the hymn are \"so that finally with Him you will always be victorious\", a reference to the eventual victorious rise of the Czech state.\n\nThe work is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, triangle, cymbals, two harps, and strings.\n• A symphonic poem to the nation Czech Radio programme in English by Christian Falvey\n• Full score of the second poem Vltava\n• Sheet music of piano duet version (arranged by the composer)Smetana: Má Vlast: MUSICAL CONTEMPLATION ON WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE A HOMELAND\n\nThe Czech Philharmonic and its Chief Conductor and Music Director Semyon Bychkov present a new recording of Bedřich Smetana’s masterpiece Má vlast (My Homeland). The album celebrates both the bicentenary of Smetana’s birth and, the start of 2024’s Year of Czech Music which has been celebrated every ten years since Smetana’s 100th anniversary in 1924. Má vlast (1874-1878) is a potent symbol of the Czech Republic’s turbulent political history and has played an important role in the Czech national movement. Contemplating the landscape, history, and legends of Bohemia, Má vlast is best known for its world-famous Moldau melody. For Bychkov, who was born in Russia before emigrating to the United States, and now lives in France, the question of ‘the homeland’ is particularly poignant – how to take pride in the best of its heritage, while also coming to terms with its darker pages. For the Orchestra to revisit this seminal piece with Bychkov, with whom it has developed such a close working relationship over the past few years, makes the recording all the more personal and topical.\n\nThe Czech Philharmonic is one of the world’s orchestral gems, recognised for its rich tradition with the Czech masters as well as European repertoire. Semyon Bychkov who is internationally renowned for his interpretations of the core repertoire, began his tenure with the Orchestra at the start of the 2018/19 season. Together, they have so far recorded for Pentatone Mahler’s First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Symphonies (2022-2023), part of the complete Mahler cycle to be released by the label.

It rises in the Giant Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (western half of the Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, 110 kilometres (68 miles) northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is 1,094 km (680 mi).[1]\n\nThe Elbe's major tributaries include the rivers Vltava, Saale, Havel, Mulde, Schwarze Elster, and Ohře.[1]\n\nThe Elbe river basin, comprising the Elbe and its tributaries, has a catchment area of 148,268 square kilometres (57,247 sq mi), the twelfth largest in Europe. The basin spans four countries; however, it lies almost entirely just in two of them, Germany (65.5%) and the Czech Republic (33.7%, covering about two thirds of the nation's territory). On its southeastern edges, the Elbe river basin also comprises small parts of Austria (0.6%) and Poland (0.2%). The Elbe catchment area is inhabited by 24.4 million people; its biggest cities are Berlin, Hamburg, Prague, Dresden and Leipzig.[1]\n\nFirst attested in Latin as Albis, the name Elbe means \"river\" or \"river-bed\" and is nothing more than the High German version of a word (*albī) found elsewhere in Germanic; cf. Old Norse river name Elfr, Swedish älv \"river\", Norwegian elv \"river\", Old English river name elf, and Middle Low German elve \"river-bed\".[2]\n\nThe Elbe (Labe) rises on the slopes of Mt. Violík at an elevation of 1,386 metres (4,547 ft) in the Giant Mountains on the northwest borders of the Czech Republic. Of the numerous small streams whose waters compose the infant river. After plunging down the 30 metres (98 ft) of the Elbe Falls, the latter stream unites with the steeply torrential Bílé Labe, and thereafter the united stream of the Elbe pursues a southerly course, emerging from the mountain glens at Jaroměř, where it receives Úpa and Metuje.\n\nHere the Elbe enters the vast vale named Polabí (meaning \"land along the Elbe\"), and continues on southwards through Hradec Králové (where Orlice flows in) and then to Pardubice, where it turns sharply to the west. At Kolín some 43 kilometres (27 mi) further on, it bends gradually towards the north-west. At the village of Káraný, a little above Brandýs nad Labem, the Jizera enters in.\n\nAt Mělník its stream is more than doubled in volume by the Vltava, a major river which winds northwards through Bohemia. Upstream from the confluence the Vltava is in fact much longer (434 kilometres (270 mi) against 294 kilometres (183 mi) of the Elbe so far), and has a greater discharge and a larger drainage basin. Nonetheless, for historical reasons the river retains the name Elbe, also because at the confluence point it is the Elbe that flows through the main, wider valley while the Vltava flows into the valley to meet the Elbe at almost a right angle, and thus appears to be the tributary river.\n\nSome distance lower down, at Litoměřice, the waters of the Elbe are tinted by the reddish Ohře. Thus augmented, and swollen into a stream 140 metres (460 ft) wide, the Elbe carves a path through the basaltic mass of the České Středohoří, churning its way through a picturesque, deep, narrow and curved rocky gorge.\n\nShortly after crossing the Czech-German frontier, and passing through the sandstone defiles of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, the stream assumes a north-westerly direction, which on the whole it preserves right to the North Sea.\n\nThe river rolls through Dresden and finally, beyond Meissen, enters on its long journey across the North German Plain passing along the former western border of East Germany, touching Torgau, Wittenberg, Dessau, Magdeburg, Wittenberge, and Hamburg on the way, and taking on the waters of the Mulde and Saale from the west, and those of the Schwarze Elster, Havel and Elde from the east. In its northern section both banks of the Elbe are characterised by flat, very fertile marshlands (Elbe Marshes), former flood plains of the Elbe now diked.\n\nAt Magdeburg there is a viaduct, the Magdeburg Water Bridge, that carries a canal and its shipping traffic over the Elbe and its banks, allowing shipping traffic to pass under it unhindered.\n\nFrom the sluice of Geesthacht (at kilometre 586) on downstream the Elbe is subject to the tides, the tidal Elbe section is called the Unterelbe (Low Elbe). Soon the Elbe reaches Hamburg. Within the city-state the Unterelbe has a number of branch streams, such as Dove Elbe, Gose Elbe, Köhlbrand, Norderelbe (Northern Elbe), Reiherstieg, Süderelbe (Southern Elbe). Some of which have been disconnected for vessels from the main stream by dikes. In 1390 the Gose Elbe (literally in English: shallow Elbe) was separated from the main stream by a dike connecting the two then-islands of Kirchwerder and Neuengamme. The Dove Elbe (literally in English: deaf Elbe) was diked off in 1437/38 at Gammer Ort. These hydraulic engineering works were carried out to protect marshlands from inundation, and to improve the water supply of the Port of Hamburg. After the heavy inundation by the North Sea flood of 1962 the western section of the Southern Elbe was separated, becoming the Old Southern Elbe, while the waters of the eastern Southern Elbe now merge into the Köhlbrand, which is bridged by the Köhlbrandbrücke, the last bridge over the Elbe before the North Sea.\n\nThe Northern Elbe passes the Elbe Philharmonic Hall and is then crossed under by the old Elbe Tunnel (Alter Elbtunnel), both in Hamburg's city centre. A bit more downstream, the Low Elbe's two main anabranches Northern Elbe and the Köhlbrand reunite south of Altona-Altstadt, a locality of Hamburg. Right after both anabranches reunite, the Low Elbe is passed under by the New Elbe Tunnel (Neuer Elbtunnel), the last structural road link crossing the river before the North Sea. At the bay Mühlenberger Loch in Hamburg at kilometre 634, the Northern Elbe and the Southern Elbe (here now the cut-off meander Old Southern Elbe) used to reunite, which is why the bay is seen as the starting point of the Niederelbe (Lower Elbe). Leaving the city-state the Lower Elbe then passes between Holstein and the Elbe-Weser Triangle with Stade until it flows into the North Sea at Cuxhaven. Near its mouth, it passes the entrance to the Kiel Canal at Brunsbüttel before it debouches into the North Sea.\n\nThe Elbe has always been navigable by commercial vessels,[3] and provides important trade links as far inland as Prague. The river is linked by canals (Elbe Lateral Canal, Elbe-Havel Canal, Mittellandkanal) to the industrial areas of Germany and to Berlin. The Elbe-Lübeck Canal links the Elbe to the Baltic Sea, as does the Kiel Canal, whose western entrance is near the mouth of the Elbe. The Elbe-Weser Shipping Channel connects the Elbe with the Weser.\n\nBy the Treaty of Versailles the navigation on the Elbe became subject to the International Commission of the Elbe, seated in Dresden.[4] The statute of the commission was signed in Dresden on 22 February 1922.[5] Following articles 363 and 364 of the Treaty of Versailles, Czechoslovakia was entitled to lease its own harbour basin, Moldauhafen in Hamburg. The contract of lease with Germany, and supervised by the United Kingdom, was signed on 14 February 1929, ending in 2028. Since 1993 the Czech Republic holds the former Czechoslovak legal position.\n\nBefore Germany was reunited, waterway transport in Western Germany was hindered by the fact that inland navigation to Hamburg had to pass through the German Democratic Republic. The Elbe-Seitenkanal (Elbe Lateral Canal) was built between the West German section of the Mittellandkanal and the Lower Elbe to restore this connection. When the two nations were reunited, works were begun to improve and restore the original links: the Magdeburg Water Bridge now allows large barges to cross the Elbe without having to enter the river. The often low water levels of the Elbe no longer hinder navigation to Berlin.[6]\n• Pillnitzer Elbinsel – in Dresden's southern quarter of Pillnitz in the Dresden Basin\n• Gauernitzer Elbinsel – east of Gauernitz in the Dresden Basin between Dresden and Meißen\n• Wilhelmsburg, including the islands Veddel, Georgswerder, Kleiner Grasbrook, Steinwerder, Peute and several more – in Hamburg's borough of Mitte (centre)\n• Kaltehofe (also \"Kalte Hofe\") – in Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n• Neuwerk – an exclave – in Hamburg's borough of Mitte\n\nThe Elbe is crossed by many ferries, both passenger and car carrying. In downstream order, these include:[7]\n• Pillnitz Kleinzschachwitz Ferry, in the eastern suburbs of Dresden\n• Tochheim Ferry, between Tochheim and Alt Tochheim near Breitenhagen\n• Zollenspieker Ferry, between Kirchwerder a part of the Bergedorf borough of Hamburg, and Hoopte, part of the town Winsen (Luhe), in the state of Lower Saxony, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) south-east of Hamburg centre\n• Ferries in the port of Hamburg, operated by HADAG 8\n• Wischhafen Glückstadt Ferry , between Wischhafen and Glückstadt to the west of Hamburg\n• Brunsbüttel Cuxhaven Ferry , between Brunsbüttel and Cuxhaven at the mouth of the river (out of service as of October 2022).\n\nMany of these ferries are traditional reaction ferries, a type of cable ferry that uses the current flow of the river to provide propulsion.\n\nHumans first lived in the northern Elbe region before about 200,000 years ago, during the Middle Paleolithic.\n\nPtolemy recorded the Elbe as Albis (Germanic for \"river\") in Germania Magna, with its source in the Asciburgis mountains (Giant Mountains), where the Germanic Vandalii then lived.\n\nThe Elbe has long served as an important delineator of European geography. The Romans knew the river as the Albis; however, they made only one serious attempt to move the border of their empire forward from the Rhine to the Elbe, and this attempt failed with the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD, after which they never seriously tried again. In the Middle Ages the Elbe formed the eastern limit of the Empire of Charlemagne (King of the Franks from 769 to 814). The river's navigable sections were essential to the success of the Hanseatic League in the Late Middle Ages, and much trade was carried on its waters.\n\nFrom the early 6th century Slavic tribes (known as the Polabian Slavs) settled in the areas east of the rivers Elbe and Saale (which had been depopulated since the 4th century). In the 10th century the Ottonian Dynasty (dominant from 919 to 1024) began conquering these lands; a slow process of Germanization ensued, including the Wendish Crusade of 1147.\n\nThe Elbe delineated the western parts of Germany from the eastern so-called East Elbia, where soccage and serfdom were more strict and prevailed longer than westwards of the river, and where feudal lords held bigger estates than in the west. Thus incumbents of huge land-holdings became characterised[when?] as East Elbian Junkers. The Northern German area north of the Lower Elbe used to be called North Albingia in the Middle Ages. When the four Lutheran church bodies there united in 1977 they chose the name North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Other, administrative units were named after the river Elbe, such as the Westphalian Elbe département (1807–1813) and Lower Elbe département (1810), and the French département Bouches-de-l'Elbe (1811–1814).\n\nOn 10 April 1945, General Wenck of the German Twelfth Army located to the west of Berlin to guard against the advancing American and British forces. But, as the Western Front moved eastwards and the Eastern Front moved westwards, the German armies making up both fronts backed towards each other. As a result, the area of control of Wenck's army to his rear and east of the Elbe River had become a vast refugee camp for Germans fleeing from the approaching Soviet Army. Wenck took great pains to provide food and lodging for these refugees. At one stage, the Twelfth Army was estimated to be feeding more than a quarter of a million people every day. During the night of 28 April, Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible as support from Busse's Ninth Army could no longer be expected. Instead, starting April 24, Wenck moved his army towards the Forest of Halbe, broke into the Halbe pocket and linked up with the remnants of the Ninth Army, Hellmuth Reymann's \"Army Group Spree\", and the Potsdam garrison. Wenck brought his army, remnants of the Ninth Army, and many civilian refugees across the Elbe and into territory occupied by the U.S. Army.\n\nIn 1945, as World War II drew to a close, Germany came under attack from the armies of the western Allies advancing from the west and those of the Soviet Union advancing from the east. On 25 April 1945 these two forces linked up near Torgau, on the Elbe. The victorious countries marked the event unofficially as Elbe Day. From 1949 to 1990 the Elbe formed part of the Inner German border between East Germany and West Germany.\n\nDuring the 1970s the Soviet Union stated that Adolf Hitler's ashes had been scattered in the Elbe following disinterment from their original burial-site.[9][10]"}

According to the legend, he was assassinated by his younger brother, Boleslaus the Cruel.\n\nHis martyrdom and the popularity of several biographies gave rise to a reputation for heroic virtue that resulted in his sainthood. He was posthumously declared to be a king and patron saint of the Czech state. He is the subject of the well-known \"Good King Wenceslas\", a carol for Saint Stephen's Day.\n\nWenceslaus was the son of Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia from the Přemyslid dynasty. His grandfather, Bořivoj I of Bohemia, and grandmother, Ludmila, had been converted by Cyril and Methodius to Byzantine Christianity in a still unified Christendom, before the Great Schism. His mother, Drahomíra, was the daughter of a chief of the Havelli, but was baptized at the time of her marriage. His paternal grandmother, Ludmila of Bohemia, saw to it that he was educated in the Old Church Slavonic liturgical language and, at an early age, Wenceslaus was sent to the college at Budeč.[6]\n\nIn 921, when Wenceslaus was about 13, his father died and his grandmother became regent. Jealous of the influence Ludmila wielded over Wenceslaus, Drahomíra arranged to have her killed. Ludmila was at Tetín Castle near Beroun when assassins murdered her on 15 September 921. She is said to have been strangled by them with her veil. She was at first buried in the church of St. Michael at Tetín, but her remains were later removed, probably by Wenceslaus,[7] to the church of St. George in Prague, which had been built by his father.[8]\n\nDrahomíra then assumed the role of regent and immediately initiated measures against Christians.[6] When Wenceslaus was 18, those Christian nobles who remained rebelled against Drahomira. The uprising was successful, and Drahomira was sent into exile to Budeč.\n\nWith the support of the nobles, Wenceslaus took control of the government.[8] He \"reined in the dependent dukes who had become restive under the regency and used Christianity to strengthen his state.\"[9]\n\nAfter the fall of Great Moravia, the rulers of the Bohemian Duchy had to deal both with continuous raids by the Magyars and the forces of the Saxon and East Frankish king Henry the Fowler, who had started several eastern campaigns into the adjacent lands of the Polabian Slavs, homeland of Wenceslaus's mother.[10] To withstand Saxon overlordship, Wenceslaus's father Vratislaus had forged an alliance with the Bavarian duke Arnulf, a fierce opponent of King Henry at that time. The alliance became worthless, however, when Arnulf and Henry reconciled at Regensburg in 921.\n\nEarly in 929, the joint forces of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and King Henry I the Fowler reached Prague in a sudden attack that forced Wenceslaus to resume the payment of a tribute first imposed by the East Frankish king Arnulf of Carinthia in 895.[11] Henry had been forced to pay a huge tribute to the Magyars in 926 and needed the Bohemian tribute, which Wenceslaus probably refused to pay after the reconciliation between Arnulf and Henry.[11] Another possible reason for the attack was the formation of the anti-Saxon alliance between Bohemia, the Polabian Slavs, and the Magyars.\n\nWenceslaus introduced German priests into his realm and favoured the Latin rite instead of the old Slavic, which had gone into disuse in many places for want of priests.[6] He also founded a rotunda consecrated to St. Vitus at Prague Castle in Prague that was the basis of present-day St. Vitus Cathedral.\n\nIn September 935, a group of nobles allied with Wenceslaus's younger brother Boleslav plotted to kill him. After Boleslav invited Wenceslaus to a celebration of the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian in Stará Boleslav, three of Boleslav's companions (Tira, Česta, and Hněvsa) fell on the duke and stabbed him to death.[12] As the duke fell, Boleslav ran him through with a lance.[8]\n\nAccording to Cosmas of Prague, in his Chronica Boëmorum of the early 12th century, one of Boleslav's sons was born on the day of Wenceslaus's death. Because of the ominous circumstance of his birth, the infant was named Strachkvas, which means \"a dreadful feast\".[12]\n\nThere is also a tradition that Wenceslaus's loyal servant Podevin avenged his death by killing one of the chief conspirators, an act for which he was executed by Boleslav.[13]\n\nThe assassination of Wenceslaus has been characterized as an important turning point in early Bohemian history, as the rule of Boleslav I saw him renounce the Franks, centralize power in Bohemia and expand the territory of the polity.[14]\n\nWenceslaus was considered a martyr and saint immediately after his death, when a cult of Wenceslaus grew up in Bohemia and in England.[15] Within a few decades, four biographies of him were in circulation.[16][17] These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages concept of the rex justus (righteous king), a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety as well as his princely vigor.[18]\n\nReferring approvingly to these hagiographies, the chronicler Cosmas of Prague, writing in about the year 1119, states:[19]\n\nSeveral centuries later this legend was asserted as fact by Pope Pius II.[20]\n\nAlthough Wenceslaus was only a duke during his lifetime, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I posthumously \"conferred on [Wenceslaus] the regal dignity and title\", which is why he is referred to as \"king\" in legend and song.[6]\n\nThe hymn \"Svatý Václave\" (Saint Wenceslaus) or \"Saint Wenceslas Chorale\" is one of the oldest known Czech songs. Traceable to the 12th century AD, it is still among the most popular religious songs in the Bohemian lands. In 1918, at the founding of the modern Czechoslovak state, the song was discussed as a possible choice for the national anthem. During the Nazi occupation, it was often played along with the Czech anthem.[citation needed]\n\nWenceslaus's feast day is celebrated on September 28.[21][22] On this day, celebrations and a pilgrimage are held in the city of Stará Boleslav, whereas the translation of his relics, which took place in 938, is commemorated on 4 March.[23] Since 2000, the September 28 feast day has been a public holiday in the Czech Republic, celebrated as Czech Statehood Day.\n\nLegends of Wenceslaus began to appear around the second half of the 10th century, several decades after his death, and spread throughout both Bohemia and abroad, including Italy, Germany, and even Russia. Such legends include the first Old Slavic legend from the 10th century, the Latin legend Crescente fide, Gumpold's legend, and Christian's legend.[24]\n\nAccording to legend, one Count Radislas rose in rebellion and marched against King Wenceslaus. The latter sent a deputation with offers of peace, but Radislas viewed this as a sign of cowardice. The two armies were drawn up opposite each other in battle array, when Wenceslaus, to avoid shedding innocent blood, challenged Radislas to single combat. As Radislas advanced toward the king, he saw by Wenceslaus's side two angels, who cried: \"Stand off!\" Thunderstruck, Radislas repented his rebellion, threw himself from his horse at Wenceslaus's feet, and asked for pardon. Wenceslaus raised him and kindly received him again into favour.\n\nA second enduring legend claims an army of knights sleeps under Blaník, a mountain in the Czech Republic. They will awake and, under the command of Wenceslaus, bring aid to the Czech people in their ultimate danger. There is a similar legend in Prague which says that when the Motherland is in danger or in its darkest times and close to ruin, the equestrian statue of King Wenceslaus in Wenceslaus Square will come to life, raise the army sleeping in Blaník, and upon crossing the Charles Bridge his horse will stumble and trip over a stone, revealing the legendary sword of Bruncvík. With this sword, King Wenceslaus will slay all the enemies of the Czechs, bringing peace and prosperity to the land.[25]\n\nWenceslaus is the subject of the popular Saint Stephen's Day (celebrated on December 26 in the West) carol \"Good King Wenceslas\". It was published by John Mason Neale in 1853, and may be a translation of a poem by Czech poet Václav Alois Svoboda[citation needed]. A supposed American spelling of the duke's name, \"Wenceslaus,\" is occasionally encountered in later textual variants of the carol, although it was not used by Neale in his version, and in the U.S. the name usually is spelled Wenceslas, as in the carol.[26] Wenceslaus is not to be confused with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (Wenceslaus I Premyslid), who lived more than three centuries later.\n\nAt the beginning of the Hussite Wars Wenceslaus’s name was often invoked, and it was only later that he was overshadowed by Hussite warrior Jan Žižka. Later, even when the Hussites and Protestants gained the upper hand in Bohemia and the cult of Wenceslaus faded, he still remained a venerated figure throughout Bohemia, with Jan Hus himself often referencing Wenceslaus in his sermons.[27] During the reign of Charles IV, Wenceslaus’s image as a saint and martyr was often employed by Charles in his enterprises both at home and abroad, and in later years when the systematic Germanization of Bohemia began, Wenceslaus came to be considered a representation of the Czech national consciousness.[28]\n\nAn equestrian statue of Saint Wenceslaus and other patrons of Bohemia (St. Adalbert, St. Ludmila, St. Prokop and St. Agnes of Bohemia) are located on Wenceslaus Square in Prague. The statue is a popular meeting place in Prague. Demonstrations against the Communist regime were held there.[29]\n\nHis helmet and armour are on display inside Prague Castle.[30]\n\nThe lavish 1930 silent film St. Wenceslas was at the time the most expensive Czech film ever made.\n\nOgden Nash wrote a comic epic poem, \"The Christmas that Almost Wasn't\" (1957), in which a boy awakens Wenceslaus and his knights to save the kingdom of Lullapat from usurpers who have outlawed Christmas, with elements from the legend of Wenceslas.[31]\n\nThe 1994 television film, Good King Wenceslas, is a highly fictional account of his early life. The film stars Jonathan Brandis in the title role, supported by Leo McKern, Stefanie Powers, and Joan Fontaine as Ludmila.[32]sv. Václav: Známe den Václavovy smrti, ale kterého roku k ní došlo zůstalo mezi historiky spornou otázkou. Buď to bylo r. 925 nebo až v r. 935. Víme, že Václav Boleslavovi odpustil a přál si, aby mu odpustil i Bůh. Lze se domnívat, že to nakonec Boleslavovi pomohlo k lítosti, kterou projevil tím, že Václavovy ostatky dal z hrobu v Boleslavi* přenést na Pražský hrad do chrámu sv. Víta. Opět je sporný rok (932 nebo 938), za den se někde uvádí 4. března. Úcta k sv. Václavovi se rychle rozšířila po celé vlasti i za hranice. Sv. Wolfgang, biskup v Řezně (972-994) oznamoval jeho svátek 28. 9. s titulem svatý. V roce 972 byl k jeho cti postaven kostel v Proseku u Prahy (dnes Praha 9). Od začátku 14. stol. je mu zasvěcený i oltář v římské bazilice sv. Petra. V roce 1670 byl jeho svátek zařazen do univerzálního kalendáře, v němž zůstal jako jediný český světec.\n\nVšemohoucí, věčný Bože, dej, ať po vzoru svatého mučedníka Václava žijeme moudře a spravedlivě, ať statečně usilujeme o to, co slouží k nastolení Tvého pokoje, a přemáháme zlo dobrem. Skrze Tvého Syna Ježíše Krista, našeho Pána, neboť on s Tebou v jednotě Ducha svatého žije a kraluje po všechny věky věků. Amen\n\n*Místo původního hrobu sv. Václava se nachází v kryptě jemu zasvěcené bazilice ve Staré Boleslavi. Románská krypta je stejně jako hlavní oltář na východní straně zasvěcená sv. Kosmu a Damiánovi, patronům původního kolegiátního kostela i kapituly. V severní boční lodi je v Knížecí kapli připomínáno místo Václavovy mučednické smrti. Z jeho krve, podle slov Fr. Ekerta, se do pokladu kolegiátního chrámu dostalo asi 15 seschlých kapek v křišťálové nádobce zasazené do zlata. Klepadlo ze dveří kostela, kterého se Václav držel, údajně Karel IV. dal připevnit na dveře kaple sv. Václava v katedrále sv. Víta v Praze. Do tohoto chrámu byly rovněž uloženy Václavova přilbice, drátěná košile i jeho meč.\n\nVenceslaus, dux Bohemiæ (929/935); Laurentius Ruiz de Manila et XV socii: Dominicus Ibá, passio: 14 aug. 1633 (1633 až 1634); Chariton, abbas (asi 350); Eustochium, virgo in Palæstina (asi 419); Leoba (asi 782); Simon de Rojas (1624); Amalia Abad Casasempere♦ (1936); Iosephus Tarrats Comaposada♦ (1936); Ioachim a Sancta Iosepha /Iosephus/ Juliá et Iosephus Casas Ros de Ordal♦ (1936); Nicetas Budka♦ (1949); ; Alph, Alexander et Zosimus (s.

His career was cut short when he died in a plane accident due to bad weather.\n\nBaťa's half-brother Jan Antonín Baťa took over his company, expanding it during the Great Depression. World War II resulted in much destruction of the business. After Communist governments were established in Czechoslovakia and other nations of Eastern Europe, they nationalized the Baťa enterprises, taking over the company group.\n\nTomáš's son Thomas J. Bata rebuilt and expanded shoe manufacturing in the company name after moving to Canada in 1939, at the time of the Nazi invasion and annexation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nTomáš Baťa established the organization in Zlín on 24 August 1894 with 800 Austrian gulden (equivalent to $320 at the time), inherited from his mother. His brother Antonín Baťa and sister Anna were partners in the startup firm T. & A. Bata Shoe Company. Though this organization was newly established, the family had a long history of shoemaking, spanning eight generations and over three hundred years. This heritage helped boost the popularity of his new firm very quickly.[1]\n\nIn 1904, Baťa travelled to Lynn, a city outside Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States that was then the center of world footwear production. He worked on an assembly line and learned about its machinery, such as Matzeliger's automated laster. He began mechanizing his production upon his return and introduced an assembly line at Zlín in 1927.[2][3] With modern production and long-distance retailing, Baťa modernized the shoemaking industry. From its start, the company developed rapidly in production and its profits rose.\n\nTomáš Baťa obtained sole control over the company in 1908 after his brother Antonín Baťa died from tuberculosis. Tomáš brought two of his younger brothers, Jan and Bohuš, into the business. World War I created a booming demand for military shoes, which the company started to produce. During the interwar period, Baťa again visited the United States, to observe progress at the River Rouge Plant of Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan. Upon his return, he directed his company to look towards decentralizing operations.[3]\n\nBaťa recognized the needs of his customers, whose purchasing power had been significantly reduced in the aftermath of the war, and enlarged his offerings to produce low-cost shoes for the general public. He also established factories and companies in other countries, including Poland, Yugoslavia, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, the United Kingdom and, away from Europe: the United States and India. These factories were allowed to be self-sufficient and autonomous in their design, production and distribution strategies, in order to be able to cater to their local population.[3] By the early 1930s, Bata had led the Baťa enterprise and Czechoslovakia to be the world's leading footwear exporters.\n• The three Bata factories in line at Batadorp Best , the Netherlands\n\nBaťa was regarded as an advocate of Taylorism, functionalism[4] and a proponent of many aspects of the Garden city movement.[3][5]\n\nBata is credited with efforts to modernize his hometown, both through employment and construction of housing facilities, making him a very popular citizen. He was elected as mayor of Zlín. Baťa is widely regarded as a businessman with an acute sense of social consciousness. He is quoted by many as one of the first pioneers of employee welfare and social advancement programs. Tomáš Baťa stated:[6]\n\n\"Let's bear in mind that the chances to multiply wealth are unlimited. All people can become rich. There is an error in our understandings - that all people cannot become equally rich. Wealth can not exist where the people are busy with mutual cheating, have no time for creating values and wealth. It is remarkable that we can find the greatest number of wealthy tradesmen and a population on a high standard of living in countries with a high level of business morality. On the other hand, we can find poor tradesmen and entrepreneurs and an impoverished population in countries with a low standard of business morality. This is natural because these people concentrate on cheating one another instead of trying to create value.\n\nWe are granting you the profit share not because we feel a need to give money to the people just out of the goodness of the heart. No, we are aiming at other goals by this step. By this measure we want to reach a further decrease of production costs. We want to reach the situation that the shoes are cheaper and workers earn even more. We think that our products are still too expensive and worker's salary too low.\"\n\nIn a scholarly study of Tomáš Baťa as a leader and business innovator, Myron Tribus states:\n\n\"However, as I delved more deeply into Baťa's management methods, it became clear that looking at his work through such a lens gives much too narrow a focus. It is possible, of course, to analyze Baťa's work as an example of what W. Edwards Deming has called his \"System of Profound Knowledge\". However, the level of abstraction at which Dr. Deming describes this system makes it capable of encompassing many different activities and while it provides great generality, it does not provide a focus on what was unique about Baťa. I have chosen a less abstract approach, concentrating on the Baťa contributions I thought would be of greatest value in contemporary management. My objective is to find the most important lessons that the Baťa system of management can teach today's entrepreneurs.[7]\"\n• Fixed rate - paid to a technical-operative and an administrative staff\n\nAlso typical is so called \"Baťa price\", establishing a price usually ending in the number nine. He found that psychologically, a price of 99 or 19.99 was apparently more appealing to customers than a rounded number, such as 100 or 20, even though the difference is just 1 currency unit.\n\nBaťa considered aviation another branch of commercial activity. His company was apparently the world's first to use air transportation for travel of not only high-echelon staff, but also to send skilled workers quickly to places where their skills were critically needed. The emphasis was on timely deployment of manpower, not on the creation of prestige travel for a few chosen.\n\nBaťa died in a plane crash (Junkers J13 D1608) in 1932 near the Zlín airport while trying to fly to Möhlin in Switzerland on a business trip under bad weather conditions of dense local fog.\n\nAfter his death, his half-brother Jan Antonín Baťa took over ownership of the Bata companies. He greatly expanded the business into new fields, even during the Great Depression. He founded the famous Zlin aircraft works two years after Baťa's death, starting with simple gliders. From the 1930s to the eve of the World War II, he developed for sale several sophisticated types (e.g. the Walter Mikron avgas-powered Zlín Z-XII, which was widely exported, and the Z-XIII, as well as some successful sailplanes) and aero engines. The Moravan-Zlin factory is the direct descendant of Jan Bata's Czech aviation legacy.\n\nIn addition, Jan Antonín Baťa started new manufacturing and set up markets in numerous new countries. In 1939 after the Nazi invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, he tried to negotiate to keep the company, before emigrating to the United States. In 1941 he resettled in Brazil, where he continued to act as an entrepreneur, creating several company towns. World War II resulted in much destruction of Bata businesses in Europe and Asia. After Communist governments were established in Central and Eastern Europe, they took over and nationalized the companies.\n\nIn 1934 his son Tomáš Baťa established an industrial manufacturing unit south of Kolkata, India. It was a complete industrial settlement and was named Batanagar. A Metro station in Delhi, Bata Chowk, is also named after him.\n\nAnticipating the Second World War, Baťa's son Thomas J. Bata, along with over 100 families from Czechoslovakia, moved to Canada in 1939. There he developed the Bata Shoe Company of Canada, founding the factory town of Batawa, Ontario.\n\nDuring the Second World War, many Baťa businesses in Europe and the Far East that had been developed by Jan Baťa were destroyed. After the War, the core business enterprise in Czechoslovakia and other major enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe were nationalized by the Communist governments.\n\nThomas J. Bata devoted himself to the rebuilding and development of the Bata Shoe Organization, together with his wife and partner Sonja Bata. He successfully expanded into new markets throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Under his leadership, the Bata Shoe Organization had unprecedented growth. It became the world's largest manufacturer and marketer of footwear selling over 300 million pairs of shoes each year and employing over 80,000 people.[citation needed]\n• Musical revue, Ostrov Dynamit, 1930 (Dynamite Island) by Jiří Voskovec, Jan Werich, and the composer Jaroslav Ježek. This comedy satirized Tomáš Baťa as the villain Thomas Batha, who together with his Chinese servant Wu-Fang, exploit the natives of a tropical island in the South Pacific. The plot revolves around the magical powers of the island's volcano, which every fifty years erupts, releasing a beneficial gas that lulls the people into calm and docility. Batha is the only one unaffected, as he uses a gas mask hidden in a forest (the exact location of which, however, he is unable to find).\n• Novel, Obuv', 1932 (Shoes), a part of Our day chronicles by Ilya Ehrenburg\n• Novel, Botostroj, 1933 (The Shoe-Machine) by Svatopluk Turek. This communist writer portrayed Tomáš Baťa as a strong-willed dictator who sacrificed himself and all people around for success of the company. After its release, Jan Bata sued for defamation and tried to stop further publishing. In 1954, Turek's novel was adapted as a movie of the same name, made by director K.M. Walló.\n• Bata is featured as a character in Vikram Seth's novel A Suitable Boy, but his firm is called the \"Praha\" (Prague) Shoe Company.\n• Lessons from Tomáš Baťa for the Modern Day Manager by Myron Tribus\n• Bata-ville: We are not afraid of the future Archived 2016-03-03 at the Wayback Machine – a British film about Baťa ideals seen through the eyes of past and present employees, as they travel to the company's heartland of Zlin.\n• Tomas Bata: Reflections and Speeches – free audiobook, Tomas Bata University in Zlin, read by Josef Guruncz\n• Newspaper clippings about Tomáš Baťa in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBWTomáš Baťa – founder of the Baťa Shoe Company – Prague Blog: Born April 3, 1876, in the southeastern Moravian town of Zlín, Tomáš Baťa would become a leading entrepreneur in a family that boasted a long and productive history in shoemaking. His family had been making shoes since 1667. In addition to setting up shoe factories around the world, Baťa served as the town’s major and gave Zlín an impressive makeover. His interests were not limited to shoemaking, either. Though Baťa died in a plane crash in 1932, Baťa Shoes remains successful to this day.\n\nChildhood and initial attempts of Tomáš Baťa in the business world\n\nThe third child in the family, Tomáš encountered tragedy at an early age, losing his mother when he was only 10. Two years later his father remarried and moved the family to Uherské Hradiště, where school instruction was in German instead of Czech. He became a shoe businessman at age 14 when he left home to Prostějov, where he worked for the company Fäber, which made shoemaking machines. Later he returned home, only to leave again, this time traveling to Vienna, where his sister Anna lived and helped support him financially. It was in Vienna that he started his own business, but he finally returned to Uherské Hradiště to work with his father.\n\nThe birth of the T. & A. Baťa Shoe Company\n\nThe T. & A. Baťa Shoe Company was spawned in August of 1894 in Zlín with the help of Tomáš’s brother Antonín and his sister Anna. Tomáš invested what amounted to approximately 320 USD in order to launch the business. When the company was started, there were 10 full-time employees who had to work a fixed work schedule for a regular weekly wage. This kind of management was very unique in its day. But in the summer of 1895, Tomáš found himself face-to-face with almost insurmountable financial difficulties, and debts abounded. To overcome these serious setbacks, Tomáš decided to sew shoes from canvas rather than from leather, and this type of shoe became very popular. By 1897 Tomáš had paid back all the company’s debts. When Tomáš’s brother Antonín became seriously ill, Tomáš took over the business of making canvas and felted wool footwear.\n\nBaťa spent time in the USA learning management techniques and wage systems. Energized by the American system of management, he returned to Zlín a year and a half later and had his employees take part in the profit and loss of the company and gave them the chance to earn bonuses. If they worked badly, they had to pay a fine that would come out of their wages. The employees went on strike, so Baťa fired them and hired new help.\n\nA determined Tomáš took over the company when his brother died and his sister married in 1908. Three years later he started to build housing estates for his employees. (By 1932, there were 1,564 houses for his staff in Zlín.) Soon wedding bells sounded for Baťa as he married the daughter of a caretaker of a Vienna-based court library. Their only son, Tomáš II, was born two years later.\n\nThe firm took off during World War I, when it received commissions to manufacture 50,000 pairs of military shoes. From 1914 to 1918 the number of Baťa’s employees increased ten times. The company opened its own stores in Zlín, Prague, Liberec, Vienna, and Pilsen, among other towns.\n\nFrom financial duress to financial success\n\nWhen the war ended, Baťa Shoes no longer needed to produce military shoes and suffered financially. To combat the strikes triggered by the birth of the Communist Party, Baťa lowered prices by 50 percent and wages by 40 percent but gave his employees certain discounts. Baťa‘s cheap shoes began to take over the market. In 1923 his company boasted 112 branches.\n\nA booming business and the fourth richest person in Czechoslovakia\n\nIn 1924 Baťa displayed his business acumen by figuring out how much turnover he needed to make with his annual plan, weekly plans, and daily plans. Baťa utilized four types of wages – fixed-rate, individual order-based rate, collective task rate, and profit contribution rate. He also set what became known as Baťa prices – numbers ending with a nine rather than with a whole number. His business skyrocketed. Soon Baťa found himself the fourth richest person in Czechoslovakia. From 1926 to 1928 the business blossomed as productivity rose 75 percent and the number of employees increased by 35 percent. In 1927 production lines were installed, and the company had its own hospital. By the end of 1928, the company’s head factory was composed of 30 buildings.\n\nThen the entrepreneur created educational organizations such as the Baťa School of Work and introduced the five-day work week. In 1930 he established a stunning shoe museum that maps shoe production from the earliest times to the contemporary age throughout the world. By 1931 there were factories in Germany, England, the Netherlands, Poland, and in other countries.\n\nHis achievements went way beyond shoe production. The mayor of Zlín from 1923 to 1932, this philanthropist accomplished a great deal for the town’s educational system, introducing reforms in the public schools and experimental types of learning. He built seven new schools between 1924 and 1932. Baťa also made Zlín into a modern town, constructing large, residential suburbs from 1918 to 1932 and redoing the historical center in 1929. Baťa expanded his interests even more. He also had stakes in tanning, agriculture, newspaper publishing, railway, and air transport, textile production, coal mining, and aviation realms.\n\nIn 1932 Baťa Shoes was represented in more than 60 countries. On July 12, 1932, Tomáš Baťa and his pilot died in a plane crash on their way to an opening of a branch in Switzerland. Even though the plane was delayed due to fog, Baťa insisted on taking the trip.\n\nThe Baťa name and legacy continue\n\nAfter Baťa’s death, his stepbrother Jan Antonín Baťa bought the company Baťa a.s. Zlín continued to proudly assert the Baťa name. The Baťa skyscraper came into being in 1938, and his stepbrother aided the town with other building developments as well. In 1934 Baťa Shoes opened a shoe factory in Bagdad, Iraq and in 1940 it christened another in Indochina, which later became Vietnam. While Tomáš had employed 120 people in 1900, by 1938 the number of employees had skyrocketed to 65,100. Jan Antonín also established the Zlín aircraft works in 1934. When the Nazis marched into Prague, he escaped to the USA and eventually chose Brazil as his home. Tomáš Baťa’s son, Tomáš J. Baťa (Thomas J. Bata), fled in 1939 to Canada, where he carried on the shoemaking business with the Bata Shoe Company of Canada in a town named after his family – Batawa, Ontario.FIRMA - Home: To first-time visitors to FIRMA and to steadfast FIRMA Members and friends, we look ahead earnestly with you to more engaging opportunities in 2025.

Critical pieces of our current understanding include the following:\n• Human milk is a complex biological system, a matrix of many interacting parts, that is more than the sum of those parts.\n• Human milk production should be studied as an ecology that consists of inputs from the lactating parent, their breastfed baby, and their respective environments.\n\nLearn more about the factors that affect the composition of human milk (PDF 387 KB) and its impact on infant and maternal health.\n\nThe BEGIN Project, an effort by federal and non-federal partners and extramural investigators and led by NICHD’s Pediatric Growth and Nutrition Branch, was designed to examine this ecology and its functional implications for both parent and infant. BEGIN explores ways in which emerging knowledge can be expanded via a targeted research agenda and translated to support efforts to ensure safe, efficacious, and context-specific infant feeding recommendations and practices in the United States and globally.\n\nThe project includes five working groups organized to address the following themes:\n• Inputs of the lactating parent to milk composition\n• Components of human milk and their interactions within this complex biological system\n• Infant inputs to the matrix, with an emphasis on the bi-directional relationship associated with the breastfeeding pair\n• The application of existing and new technologies and methodologies to study human milk as a complex biological system\n• Approaches to translation and implementation of new knowledge to support safe and efficacious feeding practices\n• The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition recently published a supplement about the BEGIN Project .Cinema and Media Arts student, 72, to graduate from college: Sam Kaplan, 72, of Lawrenceville, has added many items to his resume over the years. On May 11, he will have another addition – college graduate.\n\n“This is my first undergraduate degree,” said Kaplan. “I’m the first of my seven siblings to earn a degree.”\n\nKaplan, who graduated from high school in 1969, had not considered college. He worked in various roles. He ran a cleaning service and then a telemarketing company. He worked in customer service for a wholesale distributor of electronics. He even drove a taxi part time.\n\nAt 68 years old, he decided to go back to school, the beginning of a rewarding journey.\n\n“I was riding down 316 and heard on the radio that Georgia Gwinnett College was offering a degree that involved script writing,” Kaplan explained. “My car seemed to have developed automatic steering and I pulled off on Collins Hill Road. Five minutes later, I was registering for the fall semester.”\n\nHis journey wasn’t easy. He hadn’t been to school in 50 years. He had to relearn how to study. While the father of five had experience in raising children, Kaplan said he was nervous about taking classes and fitting in with students who were 50 years younger than him.\n\nSo, he made a personal goal to talk to one student a day and ask questions about their studies, their hopes and their dreams. Through those conversations, Kaplan found commonalities and strengthened bonds.\n\n“When you ask a student about what they want and plan on doing and find out what they want to do with their lives; I think that’s uncommon with a lot of kids – they don’t get that with people,” he said. “I think I have a good relationship with them. I got hugs from a lot of them on the last day of classes.”\n\nAlong with his classmates, Kaplan was also popular among faculty.\n\n“He'd always participate and would offer advice and assistance to his classmates,” said Kate Balsley, associate professor of film, who taught Kaplan in a number of classes. “Sam was always willing to share photos and stories about his interesting life and his family. We're so proud to see him graduate, but we will miss him.”\n\nWhen Kaplan walks across the stage to receive his diploma, he’ll do so in front of his biggest fan – his 99-year-old mother will be in the audience.\n\n\"She’s very excited,” Kaplan said. “She’s excited, happy and proud.”"}

It has about 69,000 inhabitants. It is the largest city in the region and has a rich industrial history.\n\nKladno consists of six municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):[2]\n\nThe name Kladno is derived from the Czech word kláda, meaning \"log\". In Old Czech, the word kladno denoted a mature forest from which logs were obtained.[3]\n\nKladno is located about 17 kilometres (11 mi) northwest of Prague. It lies in a mostly flat landscape of the Prague Plateau, albeit in the north the terrain becomes hillier. The highest point is at 434 m (1,424 ft) above sea level, and the lowest at 283 m (928 ft) above sea level. There are no large bodies of water within city limits, only several small creeks. The city limits contain two nature monuments: Žraločí zuby and Krnčí a Voleška.\n\nThe first written mention of Kladno is from 1318, when it was a property of the Kladenský of Kladno noble family.[4] After 1543, when the Kladenský of Kladno family died out, it became a property of the Žďárský of Žďár family. In 1561, the settlement was granted the town status.[5]\n\nIn 1566, the Žďárskýs of Žďár rebuilt the local fort into a Renaissance castle. The town walls were built in the following decades. The town prospered until the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, when it was looted by Polish Cossacks. However, during the rule of Florián Jetřich Žďárský, the town began to prosper again.[4] After the Bohemian branch of the Ždárský family died out in 1670, the town changed hands several times before it was bought by the Benedictine Břevnov Monastery in 1705.[6]\n\nIn the 18th century, the town began to expand beyond its walls. In 19th century, the town developed into a significant agricultural and industrial centre.[4] Bituminous coal was first discovered within the present city limits in 1775, but significant mining activity only started in 1850 and intensified over the following decades.[7] In 1855–1856, the city was connected to the railway network.[8] The coal reserves began attracting the iron working industry, the largest of which eventually became the Poldi steelworks, founded in 1899. The growth of industrial activity spurred a massive population growth.[6] In 1870, Kladno was promoted to a city by Emperor Franz Joseph I, and in 1898 it was awarded the honorary title of \"royal mining town\".[4]\n\nUntil 1918, Kladno was head of the Kladno district in Austria-Hungary, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.[9] In the 20th century, the city was one of the centres of the Czech labor movement, with frequent strikes, protests and labor action.[4]\n\nThe city's prosperity was once again interrupted by World War II, when it was ruled by the Nazis. In 1941, several surrounding municipalities (Kročehlavy, Rozdělov, Dubí, Dříň and Újezd) were annexed to Kladno. Vrapice was annexed in 1950 and the town of Švermov in 1980.[5]\n\nThe post-war history of Kladno was influenced by the philosophy of the communist regime. The city's development was determined by migration of labor forces unrelated to the city, by the construction of unified large housing estates and by an effort to erase the original buildings of the city centre. The focus on industrial production resulted in environmental damages. On 21 August 1968, Kladno was occupied for the second time in thirty years, this time by the Soviet Army.[5]\n\nAfter the socialist regime fell in 1989, Kladno struggled to adapt to a market economy. The operations of previously prosperous companies were terminated.[4] In 2000, Kladno became a statutory city.[10]\n\nKladno was one of the historical birthplaces of heavy industry in Bohemia. For years, the city was home to the Poldi steel factory, the region's largest employer. Since economic restructuring in the 1990s, the heavy industry has largely been replaced by services and light industry.\n\nA number of companies has established production in Kladno, including Lego, NKT Cables, La Lorraine, Hanon Systems and Dr. Oetker. Lego is one of the largest employers in the region with more than 3,000 employees.[13]\n\nKladno is located at a railway junction. It lies on the railway lines Prague–Kralupy nad Vltavou and Kladno–Rakovník. The city is served by six stations and stops.\n\nThe city is known as the home of many internationally known ice hockey players, such as Jaromír Jágr and Tomáš Plekanec. Its ice hockey club, Rytíři Kladno, was successful in the past and is connected with many famous players of Czech ice hockey history, including 1998 Olympic gold medalists Jaromír Jágr, Pavel Patera, Martin Procházka, Libor Procházka and Milan Hnilička. The club plays in the top tier, with Jaromír Jágr as its owner and president.[14]\n\nThe local football club SK Kladno played in the Czech First League in 2006–2010, but since 2013 has played in the fourth tier.\n\nThe city hosts various athletic events including the TNT – Fortuna Meeting in June, and the Kladno Marathon in September each year.\n\nThe Kladno Castle was originally a Gothic fortress, rebuilt in the Renaissance style in the 1560s, then completely rebuilt into a Baroque castle in 1737–1740 by the architect Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer. Today it houses a museum and gallery. Next to the castle is a castle park with a beararium built in 2001.[15][16]\n\nThere are several major landmarks of Kladno on the Starosty Pavla Square. The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was built in the Neo-Romanesque style in 1897–1899. It was built on the site of a Gothic church from the 1350s. The city hall is a Neo-Renaissance house, which was built in 1897–1898. The Marian sculpture group was created according to the design by K. I. Dietzenhofer in 1739–1741. This late Baroque columns stands on the site where the pillory used to be. Notable is also the Archdeaconry building, originally a rectory built in 1804–1807.[16]\n\nThe Chapel of Saint Florian is a significant Baroque chapel. It is the last project of K. I. Dietzenhofer before his death. The construction started in 1751 and after being interrupted, it was completed in 1827.[16][17]\n\nThe former synagogue is a Neo-Renaissance building from 1884. Today it serves as a prayer house of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.[16]\n\nThere are four churches in the local parts of Kladno. The Church of Saint John the Baptist in Dubí was originally a Gothic church, first documented in 1352. In 1861, it was rebuilt into its current form with a Neogothic tower. It is a pilgrimage site. The Church of Saint Nicholas in Vrapice was a Romanesque rotunda from the early 13th century, rebuilt in the Gothic style around 1400. It was then rebuilt and extended in 1858. The Church of Saint Wenceslaus in Rozdělov is modern, built in 1925–1927.[16] The Church of Saint Nicholas in Švermov, built in 1912–1913, is a mixture of Art Nouveau and Modernism.[18]\n\nKladno also cooperates with Aachen in Germany.[19]"}

The park itself is quite small, and I was disappointed in its upkeep—lots of families and dogs and small children, which surely contributed to litter and dirt I observed. I would certainly not seek this place out for a peaceful urban escape. I felt safe, but I would opt for Petrin any day.

Read our transparency report to learn more.\n\nKampa Park Restaurant is ideally located by the river, offering picturesque views that could have been the perfect backdrop for a delightful dining experience. Unfortunately, our visit was marred by the service. Instead of the warm welcome we anticipated, we were met with discourteous responses from a waitress who seemed more interested in being anywhere but there. When inquiring about the restaurant's specialty, the curt reply to 'check the menu' was not only unhelpful but also dismissive, undermining the potential of a reputed establishment like Kampa Park. It was disheartening to encounter such apathy in what promised to be a fine dining setting.\n\n\n\nAdding to the earlier discomfort, the restaurant's ambiance was as cold as the service. Upon politely asking if the heaters could be turned on due to the chill, the waitress suggested we should keep our jackets on instead. This response felt inconsiderate and inhospitable, especially since we expected Kampa Park to provide a cozy dining experience alongside their renowned culinary offerings. The lack of effort to accommodate a simple request for comfort was disappointing and added to an overall unsatisfactory visit.

It is because of our visit to this park that we saw the yellow penguins up close, and the Černý baby sculptures.

The river is in the Lesser Town / Mala Strana neighborhood.\n\nThe park was a bit bare when we were there as it was just changing from Winter to very early spring so it wasn't at its greenest.\n\nStill, it was lovely to have a walk through and had a few things to see along the way. There was a lot of families in the area and it was nice to see locals out and about. This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

Friendly service providing good food and wine advice. Food was cooked to perfection and the Czech pinot noir was just the job. Highly recommend a visit. We will be back on our next visit.

He designs his research program to study racial equity and organizational change in higher education. Specifically, he draws on qualitative research methods to understand how organization processes, norms, and practices perpetuate racial inequity. He anchors his scholarship on a theoretical understanding of university and college campuses as racialized organizations with cultures and structures constraining administrators and faculty efforts to advance racial equity. His current research projects focus on understanding how racism operates in doctoral student socialization, the academic job market, faculty hiring, reappointment, tenure and promotion, presidential hiring, and racial equity professional development. His research appears in the Journal of Higher Education, American Educational Research Journal, Teachers College Record, Review of Higher Education, Educational Researcher, among others.Cristian Román-Palacios: Cristian Román-Palacios is a biologist with expertise in phylogenetics, biostatistics, and machine learning.

The book is the most translated novel of Czech literature, having been translated into over 50 languages.\n\nHašek originally intended Švejk to cover a total of six volumes, but had completed only three (and started on the fourth) upon his death from heart failure on January 3, 1923.\n\nThe novel as a whole was originally illustrated (after Hašek's death) by Josef Lada and more recently by Czech illustrator Petr Urban.[1]\n\nFollowing Hašek's death, journalist Karel Vaněk was asked by the publisher Adolf Synek to complete the unfinished novel. Vaněk finished the fourth book in 1923 and in the same year also released the fifth and the sixth volumes, titled Švejk in Captivity (Švejk v zajetí) and Švejk in Revolution (Švejk v revoluci). These later novels were not published until 1949. In 1991 volumes 5 and 6 were again released as Švejk in Russian Captivity and Revolution (Švejk v Ruském zajetí a v revoluci), in two volumes or combined.[2]\n\nThe novel is set during World War I in Austria-Hungary, a multi-ethnic empire full of long-standing ethnic tensions. Fifteen million people died in the war, one million of them Austro-Hungarian soldiers, including around 140,000 who were Czechs. Hašek participated in this conflict and examined it in The Good Soldier Švejk.\n\nMany of the situations and characters seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by Hašek's service in the 91st Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army. The novel also deals with broader anti-war themes: essentially a series of absurdly comic episodes, it explores the pointlessness and futility of conflict in general and of military discipline, Austrian military discipline in particular. Many of its characters, especially the Czechs, are participating in a conflict they do not understand on behalf of an empire to which they have no loyalty.\n\nThe character of Josef Švejk is a development of this theme. Through (possibly feigned) idiocy or incompetence, he repeatedly manages to frustrate military authority and expose its stupidity in a form of passive resistance: the reader is left unclear, however, as to whether Švejk is genuinely incompetent, or acting quite deliberately with dumb insolence. These absurd events reach a climax when Švejk, wearing a Russian uniform, is mistakenly taken prisoner by his own side.\n\nIn addition to satirising Habsburg authority, Hašek repeatedly sets out corruption and hypocrisy attributed to priests of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe story begins in Prague with news of the assassination in Sarajevo that precipitates World War I.\n\nŠvejk displays such enthusiasm about faithfully serving the Austrian Emperor in battle that no one can decide whether he is merely an imbecile or is craftily undermining the war effort. He is arrested by a member of the state police, Bretschneider, after making some politically insensitive remarks, and is sent to prison. After being certified insane he is transferred to a madhouse, before being ejected.\n\nŠvejk gets his charwoman to wheel him (he claims to be suffering from rheumatism) to the recruitment offices in Prague, where his apparent zeal causes a minor sensation. He is transferred to a hospital for malingerers because of his rheumatism. He finally joins the army as batman to army chaplain Otto Katz. Katz was well able to avoid being sent to the front, managing to have a soft military job in Prague. However, Katz loses Švejk in a bet over a game of cards to Senior Lieutenant Lukáš, whose batman he then becomes — which would eventually lead him to the front.\n\nLukáš is posted with his march battalion to barracks in České Budějovice, in Southern Bohemia, preparatory to being sent to the front. After missing all the trains to Budějovice, Švejk embarks on a long anabasis on foot around Southern Bohemia in a vain attempt to find Budějovice, before being arrested as a possible spy and deserter (a charge he strenuously denies) and escorted to his regiment.\n\nThe regiment is soon transferred to Bruck an der Leitha, a town on the border between Austria and Hungary. Here, where relations between the two nationalities are somewhat sensitive, Švejk is again arrested, this time for causing an affray involving a respectable Hungarian citizen and engaging in a street fight. He is also promoted to company orderly.\n\nThe unit embarks on a long train journey towards Galicia and the Eastern Front. Close to the front line, Švejk is taken prisoner by his own side as a suspected Russian deserter, after arriving at a lake and trying on an abandoned Russian uniform. Narrowly avoiding execution, he manages to rejoin his unit. The unfinished novel breaks off abruptly before Švejk has a chance to be involved in any combat or enter the trenches, though it appears Hašek may have conceived that the characters would have continued the war in a POW camp, much as he himself had done.\n\nThe book includes numerous anecdotes told by Švejk (often either to deflect the attentions of an authority figure or to insult them in a concealed manner) which are not directly related to the plot.\n\nThe characters of The Good Soldier Švejk are generally either used as the butt of Hašek's absurdist humour or represent fairly broad social and ethnic stereotypes found in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. People are often distinguished by the dialect and register of Czech or German they speak, a quality that does not translate easily. Many German- and Polish-speaking characters, for example, are shown as speaking comedically broken or heavily accented Czech, while many Czechs speak broken German; much use is also made of slang expressions.\n\nSome characters are to varying degrees based on real people who served with the Imperial and Royal 91st Infantry Regiment, in which Hašek served as a one-year volunteer. (Much research has been conducted into this issue and the results are part of the catalog of all 585 people, both real and fictitious, that appear in the novel.)\n\nBertolt Brecht expressed his view of The Good Soldier Švejk thusly: “If anyone asks me to pick three literary works of this century which in my opinion will become part of world literature, then I would have to say one of them is Hašek’s The Good Soldier Švejk.”. John Willett wrote in his book The theatre of Bertolt Brecht (1959)[5] the quoted statement was “an unpublished note”.\n\nA number of literary critics consider The Good Soldier Švejk to be one of the first anti-war novels, predating Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front. Joseph Heller said that if he had not read The Good Soldier Švejk, he would never have written his novel Catch-22.[6][7][8]\n\nIn his review, JP Stern described The Good Soldier Svejkas:\n\nThe seeming idiocy and suspected subversion of Švejk has entered the Czech language in the form of words such as švejkovina (\"švejking\"), švejkovat (\"to švejk\"), švejkárna (situational and systemic absurdity), etc.[11] The name has also entered the English dictionary, in the form of Schweik, \"A person likened to the character of Schweik, pictured as an unlucky and simple-minded but resourceful little man oppressed by higher authorities,\" and the derivative forms to Schweik, Schweikism, and Schweikist.[12]\n\nIn the British television documentary Hollywood (1979), a history of American silent films, director Frank Capra claimed the screen character of comedian Harry Langdon, which Capra helped to formulate, was partially inspired by The Good Soldier Švejk.\n\nAt Prague's NATO summit in 2002, a man dressed as the Good Soldier and using Svejk's typical crutches to support himself, appeared at an anti-alliance protest, shouting at the top of his voice: \"To Baghdad, Mrs Muller, to Baghdad...\", showing just how deep the character is etched on the Czech psyche.[13]\n\nŠvejk is the subject of films, plays, an opera, a musical, comic books, and statues, even the theme of restaurants in a number of European countries. The novel is also the subject of an unpublished operetta by Peter Gammond. Švejk has many statues and monuments, for example, at Humenné in Slovakia; Przemyśl and Sanok in Poland; St. Petersburg, Omsk, and Bugulma in Russia and Kyiv, Lviv, and Donetsk in Ukraine. In Kraków, there is a plaque on a building where the author was imprisoned for 7 days for vagrancy by the Austrian authorities. There has been speculation that Hašek got the idea for Švejk at that time, based on one of his fellow prisoners in the jail.[14] The first statue of Švejk in the Czech Republic was unveiled in August 2014, in the village of Putim in South Bohemia.[15]\n• 1931: Martin Frič films a black-and-white comedy based on the novel, starring Saša Rašilov as Švejk.\n• 1943: It Started at Midnight, alternative title Schweik's New Adventures, directed by Karel Lamac.\n• 1955: The Czech animator Jiří Trnka adapts the novel as the animated film The Good Soldier Schweik (1955 film), consisting of three episodes, with Jan Werich starring as the narrator.\n• 1956–57: The Good Soldier Schweik (1956 film) – The most famous film adaptation. 16 Czech film director Karel Steklý depicts the adventures of Švejk in two color films, starring Rudolf Hrušínský as the title character. It was nominated for the 1957 Crystal Globe Awards.\n• 1960: In West Germany the book was adapted to black-and-white film The Good Soldier Schweik (1960 film) starring Heinz Rühmann. 17\n• 1962: Velká cesta ('The Long Journey') is a Czechoslovak-Soviet black-and-white co-production film, made at Mosfilm studios in Moscow, recounting parts of Hašek's life that inspired much of The Good Soldier Švejk. It stars Josef Abraham as Jaroslav Hašek and is directed by Jurij Ozerov.\n• 1986: Czechoslovak puppetoon version Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka (The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik) appears. 18\n• 2009: The Good Soldier Shweik, animated film, United Kingdom/Ukraine, written by Robert Crombie and directed by Rinat Gazizov and Manyk Depoyan. 19\n• 2018: The Good Soldier Schwejk (2018 film), British film, made at Sands Films, directed by Christine Edzard. 20\n• 1967–68: In Finland the book was adapted for television as a ten-part black-and-white series called Kunnon sotamies Švejkin seikkailuja (The Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk), starring Matti Varjo in the eponymous role. 21\n• 1972: A 13-part Austrian TV series in color, Die Abenteuer des braven Soldaten Schwejk (The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schwejk), directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner, is made and broadcast by the Austrian state TV (ORF). The title role is played by Fritz Muliar.\n• 1927–1928: Piscatorbühne, Nollendorfplatz, Berlin. The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schwejk stage play adapted from Hašek's novel by Max Brod, Hans Reimann, Erwin Piscator, Felix Gasbarra , and Bertolt Brecht, with sets by George Grosz. 22 23\n• 1935: Arthur Koestler mentions in his autobiography that in 1935 he was commissioned by Willy Münzenberg, the Comintern propagandist, to write a novel called The Good Soldier Schweik Goes to War Again. He adds that the project was cancelled by the Communist Party when half the book had been written due to what they termed the book's \"pacifist errors\". 24 Writing in 1954, Koestler stated that \"about a hundred pages of the manuscript survive, and are in parts quite funny, in a coarsely farcical manner\". However, Koestler – by then a staunch anti-Communist – never tried to get it published.\n• 1943: Bertolt Brecht writes Schweik in the Second World War, a play which continues the adventures of Švejk into World War II.\n• 1958: Robert Kurka's The Good Soldier Schweik premieres at the New York City Opera. 25\n• 2002: Sotha of the Café de la Gare writes a play, Le Brave Soldat Chvéïk s'en va au Ciel (The Good Soldier Schweik goes to Heaven), based on novel. 26\n• 2017–2018: \"The Good Soldier Schwejk\", a stage play, United Kingdom, written and direct by Christine Edzard, produced by Sands Films\n\nIt is the most translated novel of Czech literature (58 languages in 2013).[28] Excerpts from the first chapter, translated into German by Max Brod as Der Brave Soldat Schwejk, were published two days after Hašek's death in the Prague German language paper Prager Tagblatt on January 5, 1923.[29] Following Max Brod's first steps toward a German translation, he introduced the book to Grete Reiner, executive editor of the anti-fascist magazine Deutsche Volkszeitung. Her translation of Švejk into German in 1926 was largely responsible for the speedy dissemination of Švejk's fame across Europe. It was one of the books burned by the National Socialists in 1933. Her translation was said to be one of Bertolt Brecht's favourite books.[30] Reiner was murdered in Auschwitz on 9 March 1944. After the war, many other translations followed and Švejk became the most famous Czech book abroad.\n\nThree English-language translations of Švejk have been published:\n• The Good Soldier Švejk and His Fortunes in the World War, tr. Cecil Parrott, 1973; reprints: ISBN 0-14-018274-8, 978-0-14-044991-4.\n• The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War, tr. Zdeněk \"Zenny\" K. Sadloň (and Book One collaborator Emmett Joyce), in three volumes: in 1997 Book One ( ISBN 1585004286, 978-1585004287) and in 2009 Book Two ( ISBN 1438916701, 978-1438916705) and Book Three & Four ( ISBN 1438916779, 978-1438916774). 31\n• The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War, Book One, The Centennial Edition, tr. Zdeněk \"Zenny\" K. Sadloň, 2024; (IngramSpark: ISBN 979-8218487089; Amazon: ISBN 979-8327723146)\n\nThe first English translation, by Paul Selver, was heavily abridged, reducing the novel to about two thirds of its original length.[32] Selver's translation also bowdlerized the original text, omitting paragraphs and occasionally pages that may have seemed offensive; despite this he has been praised for preserving some of the tension in the work between Literary and Common Czech.[33] Cecil Parrott, former British ambassador to Czechoslovakia, produced the first unabridged translation of the work. Parrott is a rather literal translator, sometimes unimaginatively so. This literalness and uncertain command of English slang registers sometimes leads Parrott into awkward-sounding English.[33] The translation by Sadloň (and Book One collaborator Joyce) is the latest, an American translation by a native Czech speaker.\n• No Time for Sergeants, an American novel of related theme\n• Jomar Hønsi's exhaustive site dedicated to Jaroslav Hašek and The Good Soldier Švejk\n• The first ever website dedicated to Švejk: Švejk Centra\n• Osudy dobrého vojáka Svejka za svetové války (Full original text in Czech from the Oxford Text Archive)"}

Capsular polysaccharides include a remarkably diverse range of chemical structures; for example, more than 80 distinct structures are made by Escherichia coli (2) and more than 90 by Streptococcus pneumoniae (3). Despite this variety, most capsular polysaccharides are assembled by one of the two assembly strategies. This study addresses one of those strategies, which requires a characteristic ABC transporter and is best characterized in the production of E. coli “group 2” capsules (reviewed in (1, 2)).\n\nThe defining feature of E. coli group 2 capsular polysaccharides is a conserved glycolipid terminus comprising (lyso)phosphatidylglycerol modified with a short chain of 3-deoxy-β-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (β-Kdo) residues (4, 5, 6) (Fig. 1A). Its synthesis is performed by two CMP-β-Kdo-dependent glycosyltransferases (GTs). KpsS is a monofunctional GT and initiates capsule synthesis by transferring the initial β-Kdo residue to the phospholipid (5, 7, 8). KpsC, which possesses two β-Kdo GT modules, then extends the KpsS product by assembling an oligosaccharide composed of alternating β-(2→4)- and β-(2→7)-linked Kdo residues. It sequentially transfers a β-(2→7)-linked Kdo residue, using its C-terminal GT module (KpsC-C in the E. coli enzyme), followed by a β-(2→4)-linked Kdo residue, transferred by the N-terminal GT module (KpsC-N ) (5, 7, 9) (Fig. 1B). Unusually, in the thermophile, Thermosulfurimonas dismutans, these two KpsC GT modules exist as separate polypeptides (5, 9). The resulting Kdo-glycosylated lipid appears to be conserved in almost all capsule-assembly systems which use an ABC transporter–dependent assembly strategy in Gram-negative bacteria (1). The Kdo-modified glycolipid serves as an acceptor for serotype-dependent GTs, which generate capsular polysaccharides with diverse carbohydrate structures and antigenic epitopes (1) (Fig. 1B). Once synthesis is completed in the cytoplasm, the polymer product is exported to the surface by a membrane-spanning translocation pathway that includes an ABC transporter and an outer membrane translocon, which are thought to be bridged by a largely periplasmic adapter protein (1, 2). Based on conserved export machinery and KpsS and KpsC enzymes, the same assembly system appears also to be used in important human pathogens including Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni and others (7), as well as in important livestock pathogens such as Mannheimia haemolytica and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (5).\n\nAntibiotic regimens for many pathogens are increasingly compromised by resistance, so other approaches are needed. Vaccines provide one strategy and capsules are the targets of some existing successful vaccines, while others are currently in development (10, 11). However, developing capsule vaccines for some pathogen species is challenging because of the hypervariable carbohydrate structures and, in some instances, their mimicry of host glycans (12). Small-molecule inhibitors of capsule assembly have been proposed as one viable alternative (13). The conservation of KpsS and KpsC means that they present a therapeutic target with the potential to attenuate a broad range of Gram-negative pathogens, where capsules are required for survival in the host. A high-throughput screening assay has been developed for KpsC (14) and the present study is part of an ongoing effort to define the structure–function properties of this enzyme to strengthen the foundation for discovery of small-molecule inhibitors.\n\nGTs catalyze the transfer of sugar residues from activated donors to acceptor substrates, forming glycosidic linkages (reviewed in (15)). In the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database, more than 1 million GT modules from all forms of life are currently assigned to 116 GT families (February, 2023) based on sequence and/or structural similarities (16). KpsC is the founding member of the GT107 family. Despite their incredible functional diversity, the most common GTs involved in the synthesis of bacterial surface polysaccharides are Leloir enzymes, which use nucleotide-sugar donors (such as cytidine-5′-monophospho-β-Kdo) and possess one of two folds—either the GT-A or GT-B fold (reviewed in (15)). Crystal structures of KpsC-N GT modules revealed a GT-B–like structure, where two simplified α/β Rossmann-like domains are reorganized and separated by additional inserted α-helices. Interestingly, the predominant structural differences between the KpsC-N and KpsC-C enzymes are found in the N-terminal α/β domains, which are implicated in acceptor binding in GT-B enzymes (15).\n\nBecause KpsC uses CMP-β-Kdo as its donor, and produces a β-Kdo–linked product, it is a retaining GT (5). Until recently, most mechanistically characterized retaining GTs were found to follow an S i (substitution nucleophilic internal return) mechanism. An alternative double-displacement mechanism, analogous to the well-established mechanism of retaining glycoside hydrolases (reviewed in (17)), has been proposed for one GT6-family enzyme (18), but experimental support for broader involvement of this mechanism in retaining GTs was limited. We recently provided experimental evidence that another β-Kdo GT (WbbB, a GT99 prototype from lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthesis in Raoultella and Klebsiella) uses a double-displacement mechanism (19). KpsC is a distant homolog of WbbB and conserves three critical catalytic residues found in WbbB; an aspartate that serves as the nucleophile and forms an Asp–Kdo adduct, a histidine that protonates the CMP phosphate leaving group, and a glutamate that acts as a base to activate the incoming acceptor. Earlier studies showed that KpsC variants were catalytically inactive when either of the acidic residues were changed to alanine, while variants with the histidine mutated are severely catalytically compromised (7, 11). This pointed to a mechanism similar to WbbB, but definitive evidence was lacking. The primary objective of this work was therefore to investigate the potential use of a double-displacement mechanism by KpsC. To add further insight into the structure and function of KpsC, we also examined the structural basis for acceptor binding and its role in linkage specificity in the β-(2→4) Kdo transferase module. Finally, KpsC enzymes possess a C-terminal membrane-anchoring region and we assessed how this region affects the activities of KpsC.\n\nBacterial cell surface glycostructures are important virulence determinants and their exposure on the cell surface has made them attractive as vaccine targets. However, vaccine development is challenging because of the enormous structural and antigenic diversity of these polysaccharides among different species or serotypes within a species, as well as examples of host mimicry. Small molecule inhibitors of capsule biosynthesis offer a valid alternative (13), but this approach depends on identifying targets spread across serotypes and (preferably) species. KpsC is a potential therapeutic target because it is an essential component for assembling capsular structures in a diverse range of bacteria and homologs are absent from eukaryotes. However, understanding the mode of action of possible KpsC inhibitors and pursuing rational design of inhibitors are advanced by detailed understanding of the enzyme’s mechanism and biochemical characteristics. In this study, we present evidence that in KpsC (specifically KpsC-N), the donor Kdo is transferred from CMP-β-Kdo to Asp160, forming an Asp160-α-Kdo adduct, prior to transfer to the poly-Kdo acceptor. Therefore, like the distantly related β-Kdo transferase WbbB (19), KpsC operates via a double-displacement mechanism, rather than the S i mechanism otherwise generally observed in retaining GTs. The evolutionary origin of these enzymes is unclear. As a group, β-Kdo GTs represent a radical departure from typical GT-B enzymes, so a search of the PDB with DALI returns no additional proteins with global resemblance. They share an HP motif with some CMP-sialic acid–dependent inverting GTs, but we have not been able to identify any other potentially conserved motifs shared with other GT-B enzymes. Known retaining β-Kdo GTs show high sequence divergence resulting in a phylogenetic tree with long terminal branches, precluding deeper phylogenetic insight (5, 27). Indeed, prior to their initial biochemical characterization (7, 9), they were not annotated as GTs based on sequence alone. To summarize the proposed mechanism for KpsC-N, the reaction is initiated by Asp160 performing a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the Kdo group of CMP-β-Kdo, with His94 acting as a general acid to protonate the phosphate of the CMP leaving group (Fig. 10A). The resulting Asp160-β-Kdo adduct then repositions itself in the active site (Fig. 10B), occupying a second site with the anomeric carbon rotated 5.4 Å away from the CMP phosphate. This state is then preorganized for binding of the disaccharide Kdo acceptor, with the acceptor interacting primarily with the N-terminal α/β domain. The O4 group of the nonreducing terminal Kdo of the acceptor hydrogen bonds with Glu66, which acts as a general base (Fig. 10C). O4 then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the Asp160-β-Kdo group, resulting in the addition of a new β-(2→4)-linked Kdo group to the acceptor (Fig. 10D). The KpsC reactive site is therefore proposed to be composed of two distinct half sites, each with its own catalytic machinery for carrying out the two distinct half reactions. Of note, this mechanism opens up new potential strategies for targeting KpsC. In particular, the presence of a strong nucleophile in the enzyme, and the use of a covalent intermediate, suggest it may be susceptible to inhibition by electrophilic substrate mimics to form dead-end covalent adducts. Because the human genome encodes no apparent mechanistically similar enzymes, it may be possible to develop inhibitors with very narrow substrate specificity. Proposed mechanism of KpsC-N. A, the anomeric carbon of the donor Kdo is attacked by Asp160; His94 acts as a general acid, promoting departure of the phosphate group. B, the immediate product of the reaction is an unstably bound adduct. C, the adduct rearranges into a more stable configuration. After binding the acceptor, O4 of Kdo-A1 is activated by Glu66 and attacks the anomeric carbon of the Kdo adduct. D, the resulting product can then be released, allowing binding of the next CMP-Kdo donor. While most of the data presented here concern the KpsC-N GT module, the key residues that surround the CMP-β-Kdo–binding site catalyze the first half reaction and coordinate the α-Kdo intermediate in KpsC-N and are essentially identical in the KpsC-C GT module. This includes the HP and QXXXD motifs and Tyr97, Lys137, and Tyr138 in the helical subdomain (the equivalents of Tyr93, Lys133, and Tyr134 in KpsC-N , respectively). This, along with the demonstration that KpsC-C can form a C165-Kdo adduct, supports a model where KpsC-C also utilizes a similar double-displacement mechanism, with the structural states leading up to acceptor binding closely resembling those formed by the KpsC-N module. The data presented here leads to the conclusion that the N-terminal domain of each GT module alone controls acceptor binding and linkage specificity. This is consistent with the near absolute conservation of key motifs in the donor-binding C-terminal α/β domain, as well as the observation that the acceptor in the KpsC-N module interacts almost exclusively with the much more strongly divergent N-terminal domain. However, the most compelling evidence for this conclusion is provided by the presented biochemical experiments showing that the linkage specificities (β-(2→4)-Kdo and β-(2→7)-Kdo) in chimeric enzymes are dictated solely by the source of the N-terminal domain. This concept has been exploited previously in the creation of chimeric enzymes with new specificities using GT-B fold GTs from glycopeptide biosynthesis (23). Our data supports the validity of the chimera approach in engineering enzymes with new activities to synthesize defined glycostructures for fundamental and applied research. The precise acceptor recognition mode of KpsC-C has not been resolved. The need for the acceptor to both be activated as a nucleophile by Glu70 and to position its O7 hydroxyl group adjacent to the Kdo adduct anomeric carbon constrains possible acceptor models. However, it is not clear how the next acceptor Kdo residue would be recognized or why (2→4) linked substrates might be excluded. Unfortunately, while we were able to grow crystals of the KpsC-C D165C variant with a covalent Kdo-adduct in the presence of a β-Kdo-(2→4)-β-Kdo-(2→7)-β-Kdo trisaccharide acceptor, these crystals did not yield usable diffraction data. Removal of the C-terminal amphipathic helix from KpsC results in an enzyme that is soluble and more amenable for applications screening and inhibitor development. This change also alters the product profile. The AlphaFold model suggests that the changes in product length distribution are unlikely to be due to perturbation of the active site by the C-terminal amphipathic helix, and the changes may simply reflect altered interactions between enzyme and the nascent chains. The natural acceptor is a membrane-embedded glycolipid, rather than a soluble synthetic conjugate, and the activity of KpsC is also constrained by the intervention of enzymes that add the serotype-specific glycan. As a result, while the effect of the helix deletion is interesting, it is not possible to directly translate the in vitro product profile to the mechanism by which product length is regulated within the cell. Nevertheless, understanding the baseline product profile is important in developing and evaluating small-molecule inhibitors. Collectively, the data reported here offer substantial new insight into the mechanism of action and determination of specificity of β-Kdo GTs and identify concepts that may be relevant for other GTs. These studies provide an essential foundation for the exploitation of KpsC as a therapeutic target.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (Invitrogen) containing (where appropriate) one or more of the following supplements: kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and IPTG (0.3 mM). E. coli DH5α (φ80d deoR lacZΔM15 endA1 recA1 hsdR17 (r − m +) supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 F−) (Invitrogen) was used as a host for cloning. Protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (F − ompT gal dcm hsdS (r − m −) λ(DE3)) (Novagen). The plasmids used in this study are described in Table S2. They were maintained in E. coli DH5α, grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. KOD or Phusion DNA polymerase was used to PCR amplify DNA fragments for cloning and site-directed mutagenesis. For cloning, oligonucleotide primers (Table S3) incorporated restriction sites and sequences encoding epitope tags. GeneJET PCR Purification (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kits were used to purify PCR fragments, and GeneJET Plasmid Purification (Thermo Fisher) kits were used to purify plasmids. Restriction endonucleases (Invitrogen and New England Biolabs) were used as recommended by the manufacturers. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quik-change site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The Actinobacillus pleuropnumoniae kpsC gene was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and synthesized by GeneArt Gene Synthesis service based on the sequence in Accession number ABN74779. The E. coli KpsC sequence was taken from Accession Number KIE82100. Recombinant plasmids containing genes encoding chimeric KpsC proteins were constructed by cloning PCR fragments into pET28a(+) via Gibson Assembly, according to manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified at the Genomics Facility in the University of Guelph Advanced Analysis Centre. Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformants containing the appropriate plasmids (Table S2) were used to inoculate 0.25 to 1 L of LB medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, at a 1:100 dilution. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A of ∼0.6 was achieved. Expression of the recombinant gene was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.3 mM, and the cells were left to grow for 2.5 to 3 h at 37 °C. In all cases, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min and stored at −80 °C until needed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) supplemented with Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by ultrasonication for a total of 3.5 min with 30% amplitude in pulses (10 s on/15 s off). The suspension was cleared via successive centrifugation steps at 4000g for 10 min, 12,000g for 20 min, and 100,000g for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were purified directly from the residual supernatant from the final centrifugation step using 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin columns (Qiagen). The column was conditioned initially with 10 column volumes of buffer A before sample was applied. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes each of buffer B (buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole), before elution with 10 column volumes of buffer C (buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole); eluent was collected in 1-ml fractions. Protein purity was assessed using SDS-PAGE with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Life Technologies). Protein was buffer exchanged using a PD-10 desalting column and concentrated using a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator. Proteins used for in vitro biochemical experiments were buffer exchanged into buffer A, whereas proteins used in x-ray crystallography experiments were buffer exchanged as described below. Protein concentrations were estimated from A values using theoretical extinction coefficients predicted by the ExPASy ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). For long-term storage, proteins were placed in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. KpsC proteins and their variants were analyzed using LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 HPLC Liquid Chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent UHD 6530 Q-Tof Mass Spectrometer at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Advanced Analysis Centre, University of Guelph. A Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (1 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent) was used for separation of protein from detergents with the following solvents: water with 0.1% formic acid for A and acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid for B. The mobile phase gradient was as follows: initial conditions, 10% B for 5 min, increasing to 85% B in 7 min and then to 95% B in 0.10 min followed by column wash at 95% B and 5 min re-equilibration. The first 2 min and last 5 min of gradient were sent to waste. The flow rate was maintained at 0.3 ml/min. The mass spectrometer electrospray capillary voltage was maintained at 5.0 kV and the drying gas temperature at 350° C with a flow rate of 13 l/min. Nebulizer pressure was 40 p.s.i., and the fragmentor was set to 300 V. Nitrogen (purity > 98%) was used as nebulizing, drying, and collision gas. The mass-to-charge ratio was scanned across the m/z range of 300 to 3200 m/z in 4 GHz (extended dynamic range) positive-ion mode. The instrument was externally calibrated with the ESI TuneMix (Agilent). The sample injection volume was 2 μl. Data analysis was performed using the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Version B.06.00 (Agilent; https://www.agilent.com/Library/usermanuals/Public/G3336-90024_Qual_Familiarization_GCMS.pdf) software. Deconvolution of the m/z spectrum was achieved using the pMod algorithm within the BioConfirm software (Agilent; https://www.agilent.com/en/product/software-informatics/mass-spectrometry-software/data-analysis/bioconfirm-software). For tryptic digestion of KpsC-N enzymes, modified trypsin was used where autolysis has been blocked and chymotryptic activity inhibited (Fisher Sequencing Grade Modified trypsin V5111). Twenty micrograms of trypsin were dissolved in 20 mM acetic acid to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. When ready for digestion, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added such that the enzyme working solution was 0.01 μg of enzyme. Trypsin was added in a 1:10 ratio of protease to protein and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Mass spectrometry was as above, except that a C18 column (Agilent 32 AdvanceBio Peptide Map, 100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) was used for chromatographic separation (at 0.2 ml/min), and the mobile phase gradient was as follows: initial conditions, 2% B, increasing to 45% B in 40 min and then to 55% B in 10 more minutes followed by column wash at 95% B and 10 min re-equilibration. Three precursor ions per cycle were selected for fragmentation. Raw data files were loaded directly into PEAKS 8.5 software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc; https://www.bioinfor.com/peaks-85-release/), where the data was refined and subjected to de novo sequencing and database searching. The following modifications were considered within the search parameters: deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+0.98 Da), oxidation of methionine (+15.99 Da), and Kdo glycosylation (+220.06 Da). The tolerance values used were 15 ppm for parent ions and 0.05 Da for fragment ions. Data was searched against the WT KpsC-N and variant sequences. Acceptor 1 was prepared as previously described (14). The chemical synthesis of 2 and enzymatic synthesis of 3 are described in the Supporting Information text and Fig. S5. In vitro reactions were performed in 40 μl volumes and contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM Kdo, 1.25 mM CTP, 5 μM acceptor 1, 4 μg of KdsB, and 4 μg of KpsC-N or its variants (D160N, D160C, or D160A). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Ten microliters of aliquots were removed and stopped by adding equal amounts of cold acetonitrile, followed by removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation at 13,000g for 5 min. HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with a 1260 Infinity II Variable Wavelength Detector. A DNAPac PA-100 column (4 × 50 mm) was used for chromatographic separation with the following solvents: water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 2 M ammonium acetate (C). The mobile phase gradient was as follows: 20% B was kept constant throughout the run; initial conditions were 0% C; increasing to 50% C in 15 min; hold 50% C for 5 min; decreasing to 0% C in 5 min; 15 min of re-equilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min, and the column temperature was set to 40 °C. The elution profile was monitored by UV detection at 503 nm and the injection volume was 8 μl. These analyses were performed in triplicate. Determination of the structure of E. coli KpsC2-323 D160N and D160C by x-ray crystallography All crystallization experiments were performed using a sitting-drop configuration at room temperature. Protein was buffer exchanged into a 20 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CMP, pH 7.5 solution and concentrated. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160N was mixed in a 1:1 ratio (2 μl drop volume) with the well solution and equilibrated against ∼100 μl of the same well solution. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160N (at 15 mg/ml) was crystallized using a well solution containing 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 29 % (v/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, and 2 mM strontium acetate. To generate CMP-Kdo, a reaction containing 50 mM Hepes, 5 mM MgCl , 4 mM Kdo, 10 mM CTP, and 4.5 μg of KdsB from E. coli was incubated for 2.5 min before soaking crystals with the reaction mixture for 8 min at room temperature in a well, where the PEG 3350 concentration had been increased to 33 %, prior to cryoprotection. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160C was mixed with 5 mM acceptor 2 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to crystallization. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160C (at 10 mg/ml) was crystallized using a well solution containing 25 % (v/v) PEG 3350 and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 5.5; protein was mixed in a 1:1 ratio (0.3 μl drop volume) with the well solution and equilibrated against ∼40 μl of the same solution. All crystals were immersed in paratone N oil for cryoprotection prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Datasets were collected at the Canadian Light Source beam-line 08ID at 100 K and were processed using XDS and scaled using XSCALE (36). Using 6MGC as a search model in Phenix Phaser (28), the E. coli KpsC-N2-323 D160N structure was determined in P3 21 at 1.90 Å. After refinement, this structure (KpsC-N D160N, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit) was substantially complete; residues 1–320 were traced, and a short, disordered region was evident encompassing 143–146. Again, using 6MGC as a search model in Phenix Phaser (28), the E. coli KpsC-N2-323 D160C structure was determined in P2 at 1.20 Å resolution. This structure (KpsC-N D160C) has two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Chain A has residues 1–323 (plus one residue of the His -tag) traced, with a short, disordered region encompassing 146–147. Chain B has residues 1–323 (plus two residues of the His -tag) traced, with a short, disordered region encompassing 195–201. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are shown for both structures in Table 1. Structure figures were prepared in PyMol v.2.3.4. Investigation of the activities of chimeric enzymes from E. coli and T. dismutans KpsC modules Reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM Kdo, 1.25 mM CTP, 2 μg E coli KdsB, 12 μM acceptors 1 or 3, and 4 μg of purified Chimera or Chimera , in a 20 μl final volume. The concentrations of acceptors 1 and 3 were estimated by measuring the absorbance at 505 nm using an extinction coefficient of 80,000 M−1 cm−1 (Invitrogen). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To generate products for subsequent enzyme modification reactions, the reaction volume was doubled, and the mixture was then filtered through Microcon-10 kDa centrifugal filters to remove protein. Ten microliters of the protein-free reaction mixture were then used in 20 μl reactions consisting of 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM Kdo, 1.25 mM CTP, 2 μg KdsB, and 4 μg of the purified E. coli KpsC2-352 or KpsC2-675 D160A proteins. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. One microliter of the aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by TLC. The TLC plate was developed in freshly prepared ethyl acetate:1-butanol:water:acetic acid mixture (10:8:8:5, v/v), and the products were visualized using a hand-held UV lamp. Reactions were performed in 20 μl volumes to optimize enzyme:acceptor ratios. Reactions contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 1 mM Kdo, 2.5 mM CTP, 1 μg E coli KdsB, 0.1 to 1 mM acceptor 1, and varying quantities of the purified Chimera protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 1 μl aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by TLC as described above. Conversion of acceptor 1 to product 4 was achieved using 0.35 mM acceptor 1, along with 250 μg Chimera . Once conditions were optimized, the reaction was scaled up to a 500 μl volume incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, with reaction progress being assessed via TLC. Reaction mixture was diluted to 5 ml in water and loaded onto a Sep-Pak Plus C cartridge previously equilibrated with 10 ml of acetonitrile and 20 ml of water. The column was washed with 20 ml of water and product(s) were eluted in 5 ml of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/water before pooling the eluent. The eluent was concentrated to 250 μl for further purification via size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 Gl column (30 × 1 cm), eluted in 100 mM sodium acetate (at 0.8 ml/min), and monitored using A and TLC. Elution fractions containing product 4 were combined, desalted using Sep-Pak Plus C cartridge, and dried using a SpeedVac or lyophilization. NMR studies were performed at the NMR Centre of the Advanced Analysis Centre at the University of Guelph. The purified reaction product was deuterium-exchanged by freeze-drying twice from 99.9% D O. The sample was suspended in 250 μl of 99.99% D O and placed in a 5 mm Shigemi NMR microtube. 1H NMR, and 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe. Sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropanoate-2,2,3,3-d was added to the sample as a chemical shift reference in the 1H and 13C dimensions (δ = 0 ppm, δ =−1.6 ppm). The two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC experiment was collected using standard pulse sequences and parameters. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro products from KpsC reactions ESI MS analyses were performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC liquid chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent UHD 6530 Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Advanced Analysis Centre, University of Guelph). The mass spectrometer electrospray capillary voltage was maintained at 4.0 kV and the drying gas temperature at 250 °C with a flow rate of 8 L min−1. Nebulizer pressure was 30 p.s.i., and the fragmentor was set to 160. Nozzle, skimmer, and octopole RF voltages were set at 1000 V, 65 V and 750 V, respectively. Nitrogen (purity > 98%) was used as nebulizing, drying, and collision gas. The mass-to-charge ratio was scanned across the m/z range of 50 to 2000 m/z in 4 GHz (extended dynamic range) negative-ion modes. Data were collected by target- or data-independent MS/MS acquisition with an MS and MS/MS scan rate of 1.41 spectra s−1. The acquisition rate was set at 2 spectra s−1. The mass axis was calibrated using the Agilent tuning mix HP0321 (Agilent Technologies) prepared in acetonitrile. Mass spectrometer control, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed with MassHunter Workstation software (https://www.agilent.com/en/product/software-informatics/mass-spectrometry-software). Purified reaction products and in vitro E. coli KpsC reaction products with acceptor 1 were separated on a C18 column (Agilent Poroshell 120, EC-C18 50 mm × 3.0 mm, 2.7 μm) with the following solvents: water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). The mobile phase gradient was as follows: initial conditions were 10% B hold for 1 min; increasing to 100% B in 29 min; column wash at 100% B for 5 min; 20 min re-equilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 0.4 ml min−1. In vitro reactions were performed in 60 μl volumes and contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 3 mM Kdo, 5 mM CTP, 40 μM acceptor 1, 2.9 μM E. coli KdsB, and 6.3 μM of KpsC protein (E. coli KpsC2-675, E. coli KpsC2-650, A. pleuropneumoniae KpsC2-689, and A. pleuropneumoniae KpsC2-670). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C. In a time-course experiment, 10 μl aliquots were removed after 1, 10, 30, 60 min, and 21 h and quenched by mixing with 10 μl cold acetonitrile. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min, and supernatant was collected in an HPLC vial. Reaction pellet was then resuspended in 10 μl water before centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min. Supernatant was removed and combined with the supernatant in the HPLC vial for a final volume of 30 μl. HPLC analysis was performed on Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with 1260 Infinity II Variable Wavelength Detector. A DNAPac PA-100 column (4 × 50 mm) was used for chromatographic separation with the following solvents: water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 2 M ammonium acetate (C). The mobile phase gradient was as follows: 15 % B was kept constant throughout the run; initial conditions were 0% C; increasing to 75% C in 30 min; hold 75% C for 5 min; decreasing to 0% C in 5 min; 15 min re-equilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml min−1, and the column temperature was set to 40 °C. The elution profile was monitored by UV detection at 503 nm and the injection volume was 15 μl. Experiments were repeated three times.Autorem | Auto Detail | Oregon: With all of our services made to meet OEM requirements, you can fly away knowing your needs have been met while following your aircraft's particular requirements.Widex AutoREM: Streamline Your MOMENT Fittings with Integrated Verification: Presenter Disclosure: Financial: Stephanie Johnson is employed by Widex.

More importantly, BMI does not properly assess body fat percentage and muscle mass or distinguish abdominal fat from gluteofemoral fat, which is important to note because abdominal fat is associated with insulin resistance, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular complications. Using a less accurate index to assess the relationship between weight and disease risk is conceptually invalid because the use of BMI ultimately trickles into patient treatment, preventive medicine, and overall health outcomes. Several different anthropometric indices that more accurately assess abdominal adiposity through the incorporation of waist circumference exist and have been extensively studied, such as waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and a body shape index. It is important that we consider replacing BMI’s usage in the healthcare setting with a different anthropometric index: one that considers height, sex, and race differences, accounts for abdominal adiposity, and more accurately predicts the relationship between obesity, mortality, and diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, insulin resistance, and diabetes.\n\nSeveral procedures were carried out to obtain a quality, comprehensive review of the literature on BMI. First, a literature search and screening were performed by searching through three databases: PubMed, Embase, and Access Medicine. The first search was performed on PubMed using the terms, \"body mass index,\" \"history of body mass index,\" and \"cardiovascular disease,\" uncovering 7,616 results. The second search was performed using Embase, including the terms, \"body mass index,\" \"gender differences,\" \"cardiovascular disease,\" and \"waist to hip ratio,\" uncovering 96 results. A third search performed on Embase included the terms \"body mass index,\" \"racism,\" and \"cardiovascular disease,\" uncovering 36 results. A fourth search on Access Medicine was performed using the search term \"body mass index,\" uncovering 1,235 results. In total, the search process uncovered 8,983 peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2021. Of the 8,983 articles uncovered, 44 articles were thoroughly screened. Inclusion criteria consisted of articles discussing the history of BMI; studies with the main objective of examining BMI in populations of various backgrounds and sexes; studies that examined the relationship between a combination of the following: BMI, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and metabolic disease; and studies that analyzed the use of varying anthropometric indices in various populations. Exclusion criteria were based on minimal or no mention of BMI and studies that did not isolate the impacts of BMI adequately. The reference section for these articles was also searched to find additional articles, thus, some papers were found from end-of-publication citations. Data extraction and analysis were ultimately performed on 27 articles. These 27 articles contributed to this literature review and are cited in the references section.\n\nThe history of BMI dates back to 1832. Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874), a Belgian statistician, mathematician, and astronomer, was inspired by his passion for statistical analysis and bell-shaped curves to establish quantifiable characteristics of the \"normal man.\" Thus, the Quetelet Index was born: weight divided by height squared [ 1 ]. In the 1950s, Louis I. Dublin (1882-1969), statistician and vice president of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, established tables of normal weights for clients, after the company noted that more and more claims were coming from their obese policyholders [ 1 ]. Dublin's tables did not specify age, though they did place clients into three categories based on their frame: “small,” “medium,” and “large” [ 1 , 2 ]. In 1972, physiologist Ancel Keys (1904-2004) built upon the work of Adolphe Quetelet’s Quetelet Index. He officially coined the modern term “body mass index” and provided evidence to support its current usage with his 1972 study [ 3 ], in which he analyzed 12 samples of 7,426 \"healthy\" men. Keys emphasized the convenience and ease of using BMI in population studies to analyze data [ 2 ]. In 1997, the World Health Organization consultation formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic [ 4 ]. BMI now exists on almost all electronic medical records (EMR), is used as a factor in assessing various disease risks, and is commonly known to most adults and children in the US [ 5 ].\n\nThe Importance of Considering Abdominal Adiposity\n\nAbdominal fat, also known as central obesity, accounts for fat around the waist and is associated with insulin resistance (IR), metabolic disease, and cardiovascular complications [6]. Gluteofemoral fat accounts for fat around the hips and is normally higher in women [7]. Due to the significant relationship between abdominal/overall obesity and coronary heart disease mortality risk/cardiometabolic risk, it is more clinically important to assess abdominal fat compared to gluteofemoral fat in most cases [8,9].\n\nLarger sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) was associated with a significantly increased risk of sudden death in asymptomatic French middle-aged men, independent of BMI and known cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The sagittal abdominal diameter measured below the xiphoid (SADx), not BMI, was associated with a significantly increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction and sudden death when the same study introduced SADx and BMI into the same multivariate regression Cox model [10]. Although it is still extremely widely used, BMI is unable to accurately predict abdominal obesity [8]. BMI also does not distinguish between muscle mass and adipose tissue [11]. In a prospective cohort study of 44,636 women in the Nurses’ Health Study, Zhang et al. concluded that independent of BMI, anthropometric measures of abdominal adiposity were significantly and positively associated with CVD and cancer mortality. Abdominal obesity was significantly associated with elevated CVD mortality in normal-weight women [9]. Of the various anthropometric indices used in the study - waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), hip circumference (HC), height, and BMI - both WC and WHR were strongly associated with mortality in women who were not overweight or obese [9].\n\nThe 1972 Ancel Keys' Study and Its Major Limitations\n\nBMI was originally established in the 19th century by a statistician and rebranded in the 21st century by a physiologist for capitalist and research benefits [1,2]. Neither of these individuals were medical professionals.\n\nKeys did not intend on implementing BMI for medical use; he was a physiologist intrigued by the human body and its statistical analysis. He described it as a simple, obtainable measurement that translated with ease to the research setting. In his study, he acknowledges the superiority of body density in assessing body fat mass but states that it is not feasible for routine or survey use due to its time-consuming nature. Keys states, “the best relative weight index is the one that shows the least correlation with body height and the highest correlation with independent measures of body fatness.” He admits that “still, if density is truly and closely (inversely) proportional to body fatness, not more than half of the total variance of body fatness is accounted for by the regression of fatness on the body mass index” [2]. We cannot continue to ignore the fact that the original study that sparked BMI’s popularity in everyday life - and ultimately into the medical setting - admitted that it is not the best indicator of body fat mass.\n\nAlong with BMI’s fundamental limitation - its inability to accurately measure body fatness - other limitations existed within Keys’ study. The ages of the cohorts of men were not uniform. The “Bantu” cohort consisted of men aged 31-60 years, the “University of Minnesota students” cohort consisted of men aged 18-24 years, the “Minnesota executives” cohort consisted of men aged 49-59 years, and all other cohorts consisted of men aged 40-59 years. No women were included in the studies and these studies were not properly representative of different ethnicities, races, and backgrounds. Of the 7,426 men included, just 1.56% of them were of South African descent, from the “Bantu” cohort; 13.9% were of Asian descent from the “Japanese farmers” and “Japanese fishermen” cohorts; 43.7% of men were of European descent from “East Finland,” “West Finland,” “Crevalcore, Italy,” and “Montegiorgio, Italy”; 40.78% of the participants were men from the United States from the “Rome Railroad,” “University of Minnesota students,” “Minnesota executives,” “U.S. Ry. sedentary,” and “U.S. Ry., switchmen” cohorts [2]. While there was some representation of different ethnic groups in the 1972 Keys' study, this representation was somewhat random and was greatly outweighed by that of Caucasian men of European descent. It would have been beneficial to use a greater number of men from Asian and African backgrounds, along with including Hispanic men, to provide more accurate data regarding the use of BMI in these populations and to be more representative of the population of the United States, and different parts of the world. Due to the smaller amount of subjects from groups that were not from the United States or Europe and no representation of women subjects in this study, BMI may not have been an accurate assessment of adiposity for individuals of various races, ethnicities, backgrounds, and sexes.\n\nIt is time to introduce a new anthropometric index of weight inclusive to women and minorities that is a more accurate predictor of disease risk, has a stronger relationship between body fat percentage (BF%) and adiposity, and is a better representation of our patients’ overall health. Women and minorities were not included at all, or only comprised a small percentage of the 7,426 men in the 1972 Ancel Keys' study that sparked BMI’s modern-day usage in research and medical settings [2].\n\nA WHO expert consultation concluded that for the proportion of Asians, a high risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and CVD is significant at BMIs lower than the existing WHO overweight cut-off point (>=25 kg/m^2). Further research is required to better understand the relationship between BF% and BMI in Asian populations to properly determine cut-offs for disease risk, particularly metabolic disorders [12]. Sakurai et al. found that when using the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure BF%, Asians had significantly higher BF% than African Americans and whites with similar BMI [13]. Asian populations have been shown to exhibit a \"normal\" BMI, yet have significantly large WCs [14]. Differences in fat mass and fat-free mass (FFM) between UK-born South Asians and White Europeans in infancy may exist, as demonstrated by the 2012 Stanfield cross-sectional study that concluded characteristic differences in body composition were observed between the two groups in early infancy. It is the first study to show data that South Asians have reduced FFM in infancy compared to White Europeans [15]. In the 2002 Deurenberg study comparing different population groups of Asians, ranging from Indonesians, Singaporean Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Hong Kong Chinese, all Asian populations had a higher BF% at a lower BMI compared to Caucasians. It was concluded that this high BF% at low BMI can be partly attributed to differences in body build, muscularity, and height, and that universal cut-off points may not be an accurate way to estimate BF% and the risks associated with a high BF% [16]. Still, large differences between BF% and BMI existed within these Asian populations, thus generalizations surrounding Asian patients and their BF% and BMI should not be made and further research is required.\n\nIt is important for further research to be conducted regarding the potential increased risks of metabolic disease and DM for Asian populations while at a lower BF% than other, more highly-studied populations, such as Caucasians. These studies show that BMI may not accurately represent Asian populations’ risk of CVD and IR [12,14-16]. A normal BMI does not negate the increased risk of metabolic disease due to excessive abdominal fat, thus using BMI as an indicator of health in Asian populations may be more harmful than beneficial [8,9]. Physicians must be aware of this, because their Asian patients may suffer if they do not get the preventive counseling and early treatment that they need, simply because they fall into the “normal” BMI category.\n\nLikewise, it is also not beneficial for patients to be labeled as “overweight” due to their BMI, despite having increased muscle mass and less central adiposity than other patients who fall in the “normal” BMI category. This has been observed in studies including non-Hispanic Black (NHB) individuals [17]. In the Flegal study that examined the BMI of 8,821 children and adolescents of varying racial and ethnic groups, NHB girls had significantly higher BMIs than non-Hispanic White (NHW) girls; however, the prevalence of adiposity was not significantly different between the two groups. High adiposity in NHB children was about one-half of the prevalence in the NHW, Hispanic, and Asian children in the intermediate BMI category, showing considerable differences by race-ethnic group [17]. BMI was not an accurate representation of the adiposity of NHB girls, as their BMIs were consistently higher than NHW girls, yet there was no real difference in adiposity between the two groups. These categories may not only be inaccurate depictions of adiposity but can be especially harmful to young girls growing up who already face many issues with body image. If the BMI-to-adiposity ratios were different in the two groups, yet they were still using the same BMI classification to assess their health, this classification may not be an accurate representation of the relationship between one or both groups’ weight and disease risk.\n\nThe Boston Area Community Health Survey investigated the role of biogeographic ancestry (BGA) and adiposity in 1,726 men and women using ancestry informative markers, BMI, percent body fat (PBF), and WHR. They observed positive associations between West African ancestry and cross-sectional BMI and PBF, concluding that West African ancestry may contribute to a high prevalence of total body adiposity among African Americans [18]. The All of Us (AoU) Research Program demonstration project used BMI, WC, WHR, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to assess racial, ethnic, and gender differences in obesity and body fat distribution in 88,195 NHW, 40,770 NHB, 35,640 Hispanic, and 5,648 Asian participants. Their results showed that BMI was highest among NHB women and lowest among Asian women and that the largest gender difference existed in NHB, whereby NHB women had higher BMI than NHB men. After the exclusion of heavy drinkers, men exhibited higher levels of ALT than women in all racial/ethnic groups [19]. This study illustrates the differences in BMI and ALT between various ethnic groups and sexes, further supporting the need for a more updated, accurate, and inclusive anthropometric index of obesity, disease risk, and mortality for all ethnic groups.\n\nNo subjects of the female sex were used in Keys’ 1972 study, yet the same BMI cut-offs for the classification of weight status and disease risk for both men and women are still being used [2,5]. The current BMI scale is likely an inaccurate representation of women’s health status and disease risks, as various factors contribute to substantial differences in CVD risk and mortality between men and women. There is considerable evidence for sex differences in cardiac autonomic modulation, sex hormones, cytokines, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The protective effects of estrogen on glucose homeostasis and greater IR in men compared to women should be examined further, as these things may play important roles in CVD, DM, and other disease risks [20]. Sex steroids also play a role in adipose tissue function. They modulate tissue responses to other hormones like insulin and catecholamines [21]. Due to differences in sex steroids among other factors, the distribution of fat differs in men and women. Women more often store fat subcutaneously and in the gluteofemoral region, while men are more likely to store excess fat in the abdominal region [7]. Interestingly, the storage of excess calories in gluteofemoral fat and subcutaneous fat (SAT) may be linked to a favorable metabolic profile, so it is important to note the proportions of each type of fat a patient carries as physicians assess patients due to these metabolic differences that may exist between abdominal and gluteofemoral fat [6].\n\nXin Song’s 2014 prospective cohort study studied 23,629 men and 21,965 women to estimate CVD mortality in relation to obesity and gender. Men were found to have higher CVD mortality than women in all four BMI categories (<25.0, 25.0-29.9, 30.0-34.9, and >=35.0 kg/m^2), with similar findings observed for abdominal obesity defined by WC, WHR, or WHtR [20]. In the 2015 cross-sectional study that examined 762 men and 732 women to investigate the value of SAT and visceral adipose tissue thickness (VAT) for prediction of gallstone disease (GSD), differences in the best anthropometric predictors of GSD existed between men and women as well. In men, the only indicator of obesity that showed a significant association with GSD was WHR, while WHtR, WHR, VAT, and BMI were significantly associated with GSD risk in women [22]. In a church-based cross-sectional study with 912 participants from various cities in southeastern Nigeria, BMI, WC, HC, and conicity index were significantly higher in females than males. The best predictors of hypertension risk were BMI, WHtR, WC, and ponderal index in this population [7]. These studies display the importance of reassessing our use of BMI in the healthcare setting for various groups, especially women, as there are significant differences in disease prediction accuracy between men and women.\n\nIn 2021, the All of Us (AoU) Research Program studied differences in obesity and fat distribution across gender and race/ethnicity in 88,195 NHW, 40,770 NHB, 35,640 Hispanic, and 5,648 Asian participants by comparing BMI, WC, WHR, and ALT. Consistent with previous data, the large gender disparity between NHB participants was replicated: NHB women had significantly higher BMI and rates of obesity compared to NHB men. Also consistent with previous conclusions, ALT was significantly higher in men compared to women and was lower in NHB participants compared to other racial/ethnic groups [19]. This further illustrates the physiological differences between men and women. In addition, further research is required to understand the extensively replicated and significant gender disparity between BMIs of NHB men and women.\n\nBased on the numerous physiological and hormonal differences between men and women, it is no surprise that our disease risks and disease presentations are variable: So why do we still use the same BMI classifications? While men may have lower body fat, their risk of metabolic disease and other disease risks associated with increased visceral adiposity will not be represented properly if we continue to use the BMI. Likewise, the fundamental difference in the location where women preferentially hold their excess body fat does not properly reflect the obesity and disease risk of women if the same cut-off points as men are used. Using an anthropometric index that is better representative of men’s mortality and disease risk could be harmful to female patients because it could result in delayed diagnoses and treatment, and ultimately, increased mortality.\n\nMoving forward, clinicians and researchers should consider the limitations associated with BMI before adopting its usage, potentially resulting in the removal of the BMI from the EMR and its replacement with an alternative anthropometric index that is more representative of abdominal fat and BF%. While this review does not offer one definitive replacement anthropometric index, there are several that exist that have been studied that may be considered superior to BMI in terms of accuracy, ability to predict CVD risk, or associations with mortality (Table 1). This may be attributed to the fact that these incorporate a waist measurement, which corresponds with abdominal adiposity.\n\nIn the SOON cohort, which examined anthropometric indices to identify fat distribution associated with high cardiometabolic risk in 305 mostly Caucasian women living in France with severe obesity, BMI was only linked to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Neck circumference (NC) and WC were significantly associated with hypertension, DM, and OSAS. NC was found to be an excellent anthropometric marker of all cardiometabolic risk factors, including functional liver tests, in very obese patients. This is very clinically important because it can be difficult to obtain an accurate WC of severely obese patients, so NC may be an easy and accurate alternative. WHR was observed as a reliable marker for the identification of hypertension, DM, and other cardiometabolic markers, but not OSAS [23].\n\nA body shape index (ABSI = WC/(BMI (2/3) x height (1/2))), a new anthropometric index that combines WC, BMI, and height, expresses excess risk from high WC. In a US population of 14,105 adults, ABSI appeared to be a substantial risk factor for premature mortality, and its correlation with mortality hazard held across the range of age, sex, and BMI, for both White and Black ethnicities, but not for Mexican ethnicity [24]. The association of BMI, WC, WHtR, WHR, and ABSI with total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality by using Cox proportion hazard models was assessed in 2,626 men and 3,740 women from the Rotterdam study, a prospective population-based cohort from the Netherlands. In this study, ABSI was not significantly correlated with BMI, but it was strongly correlated with WC, WHtR, and WHR. ABSI had the strongest association with total, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in comparison with the other measures [25].\n\nIn one of the first studies involving more than 300,000 adults of various ethnic groups to compare BMI and the discriminatory power of WHtR and WC in distinguishing adults with hypertension, DM, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and general CVD outcomes, WHtR had significantly great discriminatory power compared with BMI. WHtR also showed to be significantly better than WC in DM, hypertension, CVD, and all outcomes. For metabolic syndrome in particular, the difference between indices was not significant for men, but BMI was significantly poorer than WHtR among women [26]. Pasdar et al. examined the accuracy of WC, BMI, WHR, and WHtR in predicting CVD events in 10,065 Kurdish adults aged 35-65 years. WHtR served as the most simple and effective predictor of CVD events in this population, although it was noted that the precision and not the accuracy of WHR for predicting cardiac events was displayed in this study, so it may be useful as a screening tool, not a diagnostic tool. WHtR may be an excellent replacement for BMI when showing information about obesity status, as it also considers height, sex, and race differences [8].\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 38 cross-sectional and two cohort studies examining the discriminatory capacity of BMI, WC, and WHR for CVD in a total of 137,256 adults aged 18 years or older, indices of abdominal obesity, especially WHR, were shown to better predict CVD occurrence. It should be noted that most of the studies were conducted in Asian countries [27].\n\nLimitations and gaps in this literature review\n\nThis review is not a comprehensive account of the differences in the accuracy of anthropometric indices between varying races, ethnic groups, and sexes. It states that statistically significant differences exist when comparing the use of BMI and other anthropometric indices in evaluating disease risk and mortality among various groups. This review also does not offer one clear suggestion for a replacement of the BMI but rather offers several potential replacements; however, further research regarding accuracy between varying groups, and relationship to mortality, CVD, and IR is necessary before declaring an alternative anthropometric index to replace BMI. Further research regarding the accuracy of these new anthropometric indices and their association with obesity, mortality, and cardiometabolic risks in these groups and various populations is required.Signia AutoFit; An Update on AutoREM Approach to Probe Mic Measurement & Hearing Instrument Fitting: Presenter Disclosure: Financial: Navid Taghvaei is employed by Signia.

The first for the \"thing he doesn't know he has at home\". Of course a boy-baby. By a pretty trick he saves his son but starts drinking anew. The second is about his drinking - Hell is really convincing treatment for alcohol abusers! The second story is \"Fearless Frankie\" about a young guy who doesn't know how to fear and tries to learn. The third - \"Mean Barbara\" (better translation would be Miserly Barka) is a pure comedy from a small town. The fourth, shows a man addicted to lottery who believes his dreams might tell him the right numbers. They didn't but, as a paradoxon, the others' will help him to become rich.

The bread hats are of marvellous colours, most of which unknown to us belonging to the human species: gremillion, which is the colour of waves reflected on the body of a fly, buatto, the colour of darkness in the morning, alambrume, the colour of a feather's shadow, or even vipinto, and many others of wondrous invention. \n\n \n\n The bread hats serve the Puufoloneti many a funcion, the best known being the collection of rainwater. Running down the walls of the multicoloured hats, the sky's water spirals down into the hole each Puufoloneta has in its head, and through which it drinks. Another reason, most important for sure, which explains the custom of bread hats, is the necessity these tiny beings have to recognise their kin while walking in the meadows. From the height of our humanity, the spectacle disclosing to our eyes while watching a field populated with Puufuloneti, is that of a prairie of pointy, conical flowers wandering in the wind: the Puufuloneti never get lost among the leaves of grass because of their headwear overcoming the height of daisies and dandelions. \n\n \n\n The realm of the Puufuloneti exists each time a sunbeam crosses a raindrop, beyond the lakes evaporating and the dew on the flowers. They, the Puufuloneti, have lived gayly for centuries, farming wheat sprouts and pumpkin seeds, but this story begins tragically, with the invention of winter. \n\n \n\n Recorded in Sopportico (Sant'Agata de' Goti), Bologna, Turin and Vienna; completed in September 2023 \n\n ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ ____ \n\n \n\n Ciascun Puufuloneta ricorda di essere venuto al mondo pronto alla vita, ovvero indossando un lungo cappello di pane. I cappelli di pane sono di meravigliosi colori, gran parte sconosciuti a noi appartenenti alla specie umana: il gremiglio, che è il colore delle onde riflesse sul corpo delle mosche, il buatto, che è il colore del buio al mattino, l’alambrumo, che è il colore dell’ombra delle piume, oppure il vipinto e tanti altri ancora di meravigliosa invenzione. I cappelli di pane servono ai Puufuloneti per motivi svariati, il più studiato è legato alla necessità di raccogliere le acque piovane. Scivolando lungo le pareti dei variopinti cappelli, l’acqua del cielo è convogliata nel foro che ciascun Puufuloneta ha in capo ed attraverso cui si abbevera. \n\n \n\n Un'altra ragione, di certo importante, che giustifica l’usanza dei cappelli di pane è la necessità che questi piccolissimi esseri hanno di riconoscere i proprio simili nel camminare fra i prati. A guardare dall’alto della nostra umanità un prato popolato da Puufuloneti, nell’attimo in cui essi si disvelano, si apre agli occhi lo spettacolo di un campo di fiori: i Puufuloneti non si perdono fra i fili d’erba perché i loro cappelli superano l’altezza delle margherite e dei denti di leone. \n\n \n\n Il regno dei Puufuloneti è esistito ogni volta che un raggio di Sole abbia attraversato una goccia di pioggia, oltre l’evaporazione dei laghi e fra le condense sui fiori. Essi, i Puufuloneti, hanno vissuto secoli sereni coltivando germogli di grano e semi di zucca, ma questa storia inizia tragicamente, con l’invenzione dell’inverno. \n\n \n\n Registrato a Sopportico (Sant'Agata de' Goti), Bologna, Torino e Vienna; finito a Settembre 2023"}

Wikipedia: Sloup v Čechách (German: Bürgstein) is a municipality and village in Česká Lípa District in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 700 inhabitants. The area of the village is well preserved and is protected by law as a village monument zone.\n\nThe Czech word sloup means 'column'. It refers to the shape of the rock on which the castle was founded in the Middle Ages.[2]\n\nSloup v Čechách is located about 6 kilometres (4 mi) northeast of Česká Lípa and 32 km (20 mi) west of Liberec. It lies in the Ralsko Uplands. The highest point the hill Slavíček at 535 m (1,755 ft) above sea level. In the southern part of the municipal territory there is a sandstone rock town.[3]\n\nThe first written mention of Sloup v Čechách is from 1318. There was a customs office on an old trade route from Prague to Zittau. In 1595, the Berka of Dubá family had a new manor house built. The greatest development of the village occurred after 1726, during the rule of Count Josef Jan Maxmilián Kinsky, who turned the estate into an important centre of industry and craft.[4]\n\nFrom 1870, Sloup v Čechách became a holiday resort with a number of number of recreational facilities. After World War II, the German population was expelled. From 1981 to 1990, Sloup v Čechách was an administrative part of Nový Bor.[4]\n\nThere are no railways or major roads passing through the municipality.\n\nSloup v Čechách is known for the Sloup Castle. It is a rock castle on a 35 m (115 ft) high sandstone rock.[7]\n\nSloup Chateau was built by Count Kinsky in the Baroque style in 1730–1733. Today the building serves as a retirement home.[8]\n\nThe Church of Saint Catherine of Alexandria was originally built in the 14th century. The current church was built in 1707–1719.

Pražská města prožívala jaro roku 1420 v obavách a připravovala se k obraně, do města proudily zásoby a posily z dalších měst ovládaných husity. Obavy to byly oprávněné, neboť křižácké vojsko, které se během jarních měsíců sbíralo k tažení do Čech, také opravdu zamířilo k srdci českého království a na konci června skutečně přitáhlo k branám české metropole."}

Consistent with decision IPCC/XLI-4, a preliminary Scoping meeting for the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Synthesis Report (SYR) was held during the AR6 Scoping Meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 1 to 5 May 2017. The Panel at its 46th Session held from 6 to 10 September 2017 in Montreal, Canada, took note of document IPCC-XLVI/Doc.6 which was produced during the scoping meeting.\n\nA dedicated Scoping meeting for the AR6 Synthesis Report was held in Singapore from 21 to 23 October 2019, the outcome of which is included in the AR6 SYR Scoping document IPCC-LII/Doc.10 submitted to the 52nd session of the Panel. It is explained in more detail in the information document IPCC-LII/INF.12.\n\nThe Panel at its 52nd Session held in Paris, France from 24 to 28 February 2020 agreed to the outline of the AR6 SYR as is contained in Annex 1 to Decision IPCC-LII-10.\n\nThe SYR outline agreed at the 52nd Panel Session of the IPCC consists of an introduction and three main sections arranged by timeframes. The first section, ‘Current Status and Trends’, covers the historical and present period. The second section, ‘Long-term Climate and Development Futures’, addresses projected futures up to 2100 and beyond. The final section is ‘Near-term Responses in a Changing Climate’, considers current international policy timeframes, and the time interval between now and 2030-2040.\n\nThis structure, substantially different to what was adopted for AR5 SYR, enables a holistic framing that integrates across the Working Groups, better enabling the SYR to cover different aspects of climate change.Credits for new clean vehicles purchased in 2023 or after | Internal Revenue Service: If you place in service a new plug-in electric vehicle (EV) or fuel cell vehicle (FCV) in 2023 or after, you may qualify for a clean vehicle tax credit. For more information on how to qualify see Publication 5866, New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit Checklist PDF.\n\nAt the time of sale, a seller must give you information about your vehicle's qualifications. Sellers must also register online and report the same information to the IRS. If they don't, your vehicle won't be eligible for the credit. For more information see Publication 5905, Information for Consumers Purchasing a New or Used Clean Vehicle PDF.\n\nFind information on credits for used clean vehicles, qualified commercial clean vehicles and new plug-in EVs purchased before 2023.\n\nYou may qualify for a credit up to $7,500 under Internal Revenue Code Section 30D if you buy a new, qualified plug-in EV or fuel cell electric vehicle (FCV). The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 changed the rules for this credit for vehicles purchased from 2023 to 2032.\n\nThe credit is available to individuals and their businesses.\n\nTo qualify, you must:\n• Buy it for your own use, not for resale\n• Use it primarily in the U.S.\n\nIn addition, your modified adjusted gross income (AGI) may not exceed:\n• $150,000 for all other filers\n\nYou can use your modified AGI from the year you take delivery of the vehicle or the year before, whichever is less. If your modified AGI is below the threshold in 1 of the 2 years, you can claim the credit.\n\nIf you do not transfer the credit, it is nonrefundable when you file your taxes, so you can't get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes. You can't apply any excess credit to future tax years.\n\nThe amount of the credit depends on when you placed the vehicle in-service (took delivery), regardless of purchase date.\n\nFor vehicles placed in-service January 1 to April 17, 2023:\n• Plus $417 for a vehicle with at least 7 kilowatt hours of battery capacity\n• Plus $417 for each kilowatt hour of battery capacity beyond 5 kilowatt hours\n\nIn general, the minimum credit will be $3,751 ($2,500 + 3 times $417), the credit amount for a vehicle with the minimum 7 kilowatt hours of battery capacity.\n\nFor vehicles placed in-service April 18, 2023 and after:\n\nVehicles will have to meet all of the same criteria listed above, plus meet new critical mineral and battery component requirements for a credit up to:\n• $3,750 if the vehicle meets the critical minerals requirement only\n• $3,750 if the vehicle meets the battery components requirement only\n• $7,500 if the vehicle meets both\n\nA vehicle that doesn't meet either requirement will not be eligible for a credit.\n\nClick the button below to see if a vehicle is eligible for the new clean vehicle credit.\n\n Go to fueleconomy.gov\n• Have a battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours\n• Have a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds\n• Meet critical mineral and battery component requirements (as of April 18, 2023)\n\nThe sale qualifies only if:\n• You buy the vehicle new.\n• The seller reports required information to you at the time of sale and to the IRS.\n• Sellers are required to report your name and taxpayer identification number to the IRS for you to be eligible to claim the credit.\n\nIn addition, the vehicle's manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) can't exceed:\n\nMSRP is the retail price of the automobile suggested by the manufacturer, including manufacturer installed options, accessories and trim but excluding destination fees. It isn't necessarily the price you pay.\n\nYou can find your vehicle's weight, battery capacity, final assembly location (listed as \"final assembly point\") and VIN on the vehicle's window sticker.\n\nHow to claim the credit\n\nTo claim the credit, file Form 8936, Clean Vehicle Credits with your tax return. You will need to provide your vehicle's VIN.\n\nThe dealer should give you a paper copy of a time-of-sale report when you complete your purchase.\n• Keep this copy for your records because it affirms that the dealer sent a report to the IRS on the purchase date.\n• If you didn’t receive a copy of the report, follow our step-by-step guide.\n\nYou must file Form 8936 when you file your tax return for the year in which you take delivery of the vehicle. This is true whether you transferred the credit at the time of sale or you’re waiting to claim the credit when you file.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns, follow our step-by-step guide.\n• Credits for new electric vehicles purchased in 2022 or before\n• Credits and deductions under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022\n• Frequently asked questions about the New, Previously-owned and Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit"}

He has been described as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time,[nb 1] and, by some, as the greatest goalkeeper, alongside Peter Schmeichel, in Premier League history.[nb 2]\n\nČech began his senior career at Chmel Blšany in 1999, where he played sporadically for two seasons prior to relocating to Sparta Prague in 2001. At age 19, Čech became a first team regular, and his single campaign with the club saw him register a league record of not conceding a goal in 903 competitive minutes. This led to his first move abroad, when he relocated to France to join Ligue 1 side Rennes for a fee of €5.5 million (£3.9 million) in 2002.\n\nIn France, Čech starred in an under-performing team, and was the subject of a then club-record transfer for a goalkeeper when he moved to Premier League side Chelsea for a fee of £7 million (€9.8 million) in 2004. In his eleven-year spell at Chelsea, Čech made 494 appearances in all competitions, making him the club's seventh most capped player of all time.[20] He also helped the club win four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, and one UEFA Europa League title. Čech also holds Chelsea's all-time record for clean sheets, with 228.[21] Čech departed Chelsea in 2015 to join city rivals Arsenal for a fee of £10 million, where he won another FA Cup before retiring in 2019.\n\nA Czech international, Čech made his debut with the Czech Republic in 2002, and is the most capped player in the history of the Czech national team, with 124 caps. He represented his country at the 2006 World Cup, as well as the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 European Championships. He was voted into the Euro 2004 All-Star team after helping the Czechs reach the semi-finals, and served as the team's captain, prior to retiring from international competition in 2016. Čech also holds the record for the most Czech Footballer of the Year and Czech Golden Ball wins.\n\nČech holds a number of goalkeeping records, including the Premier League record for fewest appearances required to reach 100 clean sheets, having done so in 180 appearances, the most clean sheets in a season (24), as well as the record for the most clean sheets in Premier League history (202).[22][23] Čech is also the only goalkeeper to have won the Premier League Golden Glove with two separate clubs, and has won it a joint record four times; in the 2004–05, 2009–10, 2013–14 and the 2015–16 seasons. He was voted the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper in 2005, received the award of Best Goalkeeper in the 2004–05, 2006–07 and 2007–08 editions of the UEFA Champions League, and went 1,025 minutes without conceding a goal in the 2004–05 season, a league record.[a] He has the third most clean sheets since 2000 among all goalkeepers.\n\nČech started playing football aged seven for Škoda Plzeň (later known as Viktoria Plzeň). In his early days, he played as a striker, although he moved to the goalkeeper position after breaking his leg at age ten.[25] Čech joined Czech First League team Chmel Blšany in June 1999[26] and made his league debut at the age of 17 in October 1999, in a 3–1 loss against Sparta.[26]\n\nČech signed a five-and-a-half-year contract with Sparta Prague at the age of 18 in January 2001, although he remained at Blšany until the end of the 2000–01 season.[27] In November 2001, Čech broke the record formerly held by Theodor Reimann for the longest time elapsed without conceding a goal in the Czech professional league, stretching his run to 855 minutes.[28] His clean sheet record finally ended when he was beaten by a goal from Marcel Melecký of Bohemians on 17 November 2001, ending his record at 903 consecutive minutes without conceding.[29]\n\nDespite Čech not winning the league title in the spring of 2002 with Sparta, he attracted interest from English clubs including Arsenal due to his international performances. Due to difficulties in obtaining a work permit, however, a proposed deal with the Gunners fell through.[30]\n\nIn July 2002, Čech moved to French club Rennes, signing a four-year contract for a transfer fee reported as CZK150 million (€5.5 million).[31]\n\nDuring his first season in France, he was awarded man of the match against Paris Saint-Germain by L'Équipe.[32] In May 2003, Rennes was at the bottom of the league table,[32] yet escaped relegation with a win over Montpellier in the final matchday.[33]\n\nChelsea made a transfer bid for Čech in January 2004 which was rejected.[34] However in February Rennes agreed to Čech's move to Chelsea for £7 million. Čech signed a five-year contract, to commence in July 2004, becoming the most expensive goalkeeper in Chelsea's history at that time.[35][36] Čech's was one of many British club transfers that came under the spotlight in the 2006 football corruption investigation for being potentially in breach of transfer regulations. The Stevens inquiry report, published in June 2007, found no evidence of illegal payments.[37]\n\nWhen Čech arrived at Chelsea, Carlo Cudicini was already established as Chelsea's first choice goalkeeper. Cudicini, however, suffered a pre-season elbow injury that allowed Chelsea manager José Mourinho to promote Čech into the starting spot, where he became the first-choice goalkeeper in his first season. He kept a clean sheet in his Premier League debut in a 1–0 victory over Manchester United.[39] On 5 March 2005, Čech set a new Premier League record of 1,025 minutes without letting in a goal, though his record was later broken by Manchester United's Edwin van der Sar. Čech finally conceded to Leon McKenzie of Norwich City, after keeping a clean sheet in the league since 12 December 2004 when Thierry Henry scored for Arsenal.[36] Čech was given a special award by the Premier League for the new record, and he was also awarded the Premier League Golden Glove at the end of the 2004–05 season for keeping a record 24 clean sheets in the Premier League.[40]\n\nChelsea retained the Premier League title in the 2005–06 season, with Čech playing in 34 league matches. Chelsea conceded just 22 times during the season.[41] In January 2006, he was named the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper for 2005.[42] In February 2006, Čech signed a two-year contract extension, keeping him at the club until 2010.[43] He was also named the Czech Footballer of the Year for the first time.[44]\n\nČech underwent minor shoulder surgery on 27 June 2006 to repair a long-standing injury stemming from the previous season.[45] He returned to action on 27 August 2006.[46]\n\nČech sustained a head injury in the match against Reading at the Madejski Stadium on 14 October 2006 when he collided with Reading midfielder Stephen Hunt inside Chelsea's penalty area within the first minute of a Premier League match. Hunt's right knee hit Čech's head, leaving the goalkeeper requiring treatment.[47] Čech was taken off after several minutes and replaced by Carlo Cudicini, who himself was knocked unconscious later in the same game, forcing Chelsea captain John Terry to play in goal for the match's remaining minutes.[47] Čech underwent surgery for a depressed skull fracture.[48] Initially unaware of the seriousness of the injury, the doctors later reported that it nearly cost Čech his life,[49] and as a result of the collision, he suffered intense headaches. Chelsea went on to win the match 1–0.[50]\n\nChelsea manager José Mourinho blamed Hunt for Čech's injury, saying that his challenge was \"a disgrace\".[51] He also criticised the South Central Ambulance Service[52] and match referee Mike Riley.[53] A number of commentators, including current and former goalkeepers, saw the incident as highlighting the need for greater protection for goalkeepers.[54][55]\n\nČech was able to return home on 24 October 2006 and participated in light training the following week. Chelsea, however, announced that the goalkeeper would be out for three months, in line with medical advice on the time needed for complete recovery from the skull fracture.[56] In an interview, Čech said that he had no memory of the injury itself.[57]\n\nČech made his comeback in a Premier League match in a 2–0 defeat against Liverpool on 20 January 2007, wearing a rugby style headguard[58] made by Canterbury of New Zealand and carrying the manufacturer's logo. This caused friction with Czech national team sponsor Puma and Chelsea's apparel manufacturer Adidas. The matter was resolved after the latter sponsor developed its own headgear for Čech to wear in club matches, while the player went on to wear an unbranded cap for national team games. Čech wore the headguard for the rest of his career.\n\nAlthough Chelsea lost Čech's comeback match, he then went approximately 810 minutes of Premier League play without conceding a goal. On 11 April 2007, Čech was awarded the Premier League Player of the Month for the first time in his career, in recognition of his eight successive league clean sheets. He was the first goalkeeper to receive the award since Tim Flowers in 2000.[60] This run was ended during a 4–1 Chelsea victory over West Ham United on 18 April 2007 when Carlos Tevez scored against him.[citation needed]\n\nČech also kept a clean sheet for Chelsea in the 2007 FA Cup Final against Manchester United. He and United's Edwin van der Sar shared the honour of being the first goalkeepers to keep a clean sheet over 90 minutes in a competitive fixture at the new Wembley Stadium, but Čech became the first goalkeeper to end a competitive game unbeaten, as Chelsea beat United 1–0 to win the FA Cup.[61]\n\nČech started the 2007–08 season conceding two goals against Birmingham City in the first match of the season. Despite this, Chelsea managed to win 3–2 and set an English record for their 64th consecutive unbeaten league match at home.[62]\n\nIn November 2007, Čech suffered an injury to his right calf muscle in the 0–0 UEFA Champions League group stage match at Schalke 04.[63] The following month, on 23 December 2007, he had to be replaced during a match against Blackburn Rovers due to a hip injury.[64]\n\nChelsea suffered their first major blow when they lost the League Cup final to Tottenham Hotspur, with Čech parrying the ball onto Jonathan Woodgate's head for the winner.[65] He played in several games until injuring his ankle in training on the eve of Chelsea's home Champions League tie with Greek champions Olympiacos.[66][67] In the weeks that followed, Čech missed key games of Chelsea's campaign, including the derby with Arsenal and both legs of the Champions League quarter-final.[citation needed]\n\nOn 7 April 2008, it was announced that Čech had undergone emergency surgery on his chin and lips following an accidental collision with Tal Ben Haim during training.[68][69] He had 50 stitches put on his mouth and chin.[70] He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against Wigan Athletic which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the Champions League final against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a penalty shoot-out.[citation needed]\n\nČech signed a new five-year contract in July 2008 to keep him at Chelsea until 2013.[40] Chelsea started the 2008–09 season in good form, conceding only 7 goals in 17 games and keeping 11 clean sheets, 10 of which with Čech in goal.[citation needed]\n\nIn November 2008, Chelsea beat Sunderland 5–0 at Stamford Bridge, a game which marked the 100th match Čech had played for Chelsea without conceding a goal.[71] Chelsea had a 1–0 victory over Juventus in the Champions League on his 200th appearance for the club, and he also starred in a 1–0 away victory at Villa Park against Aston Villa, saving from Gabriel Agbonlahor and Gareth Barry. The following week, Čech helped Chelsea move up to second place in the league by saving from Paul Scharner in the first half against Wigan Athletic at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea won 2–1. Successive clean sheets by Čech in Chelsea's wins against Portsmouth and Coventry City saw his side consolidate their position in the Premier League whilst progressing into the FA Cup semi-finals. Čech also made saves from Dirk Kuyt and Xabi Alonso as Chelsea beat Liverpool 3–1 at Anfield in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final.[citation needed]\n\nIn a crucial Premier League game in April 2009, with Chelsea comfortably leading 4–0 against Bolton Wanderers, Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink took off both Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard only for Bolton to score three late goals which questioned the Chelsea defence, and in particular Čech. Čech, however, responded when he saved a penalty from Mark Noble in Chelsea's 1–0 win at the Boleyn Ground against West Ham.[72] He also kept a clean sheet in the next game against Barcelona during the Champions League semi-final first leg match. Following a 3–2 win against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light, Čech and Chelsea finished the season with the joint-tightest defence in the Premier League along with Manchester United, having conceded just 24 goals over the course of the season.[73] Despite conceding the fastest goal in FA Cup final history, Čech helped Chelsea's 2009 FA Cup Final triumph over Everton. Chelsea won 2–1, earning the Czech his seventh trophy at the club.[74]\n\nFormer Chelsea coach Luiz Felipe Scolari accused Čech, Michael Ballack and Drogba of causing his sacking, saying that they \"did not accept my training methods or my demands\". Scolari also said that it stemmed from a row between him and the Czech goalkeeper over the latter's alleged insistence on being given a personal coach. Čech denied the claims saying that he was \"disappointed with [Scolari] because never in my life have I had a personal goalkeeping coach\".[75]\n\nČech began the 2009–10 season in winning form with Chelsea, beating Manchester United in the Community Shield final at Wembley. With the game level at 2–2 at the end of normal time, Čech saved penalties from Ryan Giggs and Patrice Evra.[76] Čech kept goal for Chelsea in the six-match winning run that opened their season and placed them on top of the Premier League. On 26 September 2009, however, Čech was sent off and at the same time conceded the winning penalty for a trip on Wigan forward Hugo Rodallega, in the defeat that broke the run and conceded the lead in the league to Manchester United.[77] On 27 February 2010, Čech sustained a calf injury in the Champions League match against Inter Milan.[78] On 13 April, Čech kept his 100th Premier League clean sheet for Chelsea, against Bolton.[79] He won his second Premier League Golden Glove award for the season, having kept 17 clean sheets in the Premier League as Chelsea secured a third title.[80] He concluded his season by saving a Kevin-Prince Boateng penalty against Portsmouth in the FA Cup final, ensuring that the Blues went on to retain the Cup and achieve their first domestic double.[81]\n\nDuring 2010–11 pre-season training, Čech reaggravated the calf injury he suffered against Inter the previous season.[63] Scans revealed a muscle tear that sidelined him for the next three weeks, including Chelsea's 3–1 loss to Manchester United in the Community Shield. He returned on 14 August and kept a clean sheet as Chelsea beat West Bromwich Albion 6–0. Čech then kept another clean sheet in a 2–0 win over Arsenal,[82] before keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw at Villa Park.[83] On 7 March, Čech made his 300th Chelsea appearance, against Premier League side Blackpool, which Chelsea went on to win 3–1. On 19 May, Čech was awarded the Chelsea Player of the Year for the first time. More than 28,000 fans voted for the award, which was handed over by Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti.[84]\n\nČech started the opening game of Chelsea's 2011–12 Premier League season away to Stoke City, which ended 0–0. On 18 August 2011, Čech was ruled out for up to four weeks after he sustained a knee injury in training.[85] He made his return three weeks later against Sunderland in which Chelsea won 2–1. He kept a clean sheet in Chelsea's first Champions League match of the season in a 2–0 win over Bayer Leverkusen. On 27 February, Čech was announced as the Czech Footballer of the Year for 2011, winning the award for the fifth time.[86] On 24 March, Čech played his 250th league game for Chelsea against Tottenham Hotspur in a 0–0 draw at Stamford Bridge.[87] Čech saved a penalty in extra time against former teammate Arjen Robben, and two penalties in the subsequent penalty shoot-out, of the 2012 Champions League final against Bayern Munich resulting in the first Champions League win for Chelsea.[88] Čech was named the Fans' Man of the Match following his heroic performance in goal for The Blues.[89] By winning the Champions League, Čech became just the fourth Czech to win the competition.[90] He finished the season by signing a new four-year contract with Chelsea in May, keeping him with the club until the end of the 2015–16 season.[91]\n\nČech started in Chelsea's first match of the 2012–13 season, the 2012 Community Shield against Manchester City, but failed to keep a clean sheet as Chelsea went down 3–2 to goals from Yaya Touré, Carlos Tevez and Samir Nasri.[92] He also featured in the last UEFA Super Cup to be played at Monaco's Stade Louis II, in which he conceded four goals as Chelsea lost 4–1 to the UEFA Europa League winners Atlético Madrid.[93] In October 2012, Čech took the captain's armband as regular Chelsea captain John Terry was sidelined with a four-match ban.[94]\n\nIn May 2013, Čech won the UEFA Europa League when Chelsea defeated Benfica 2–1 in the final.[95]\n\nOn 19 October 2013, Čech made his 300th Premier League appearance for Chelsea, in a 4–1 home win over newly promoted side Cardiff City.[96] On 11 January 2014, he kept his 209th clean sheet for Chelsea in all competitions in a 2–0 away win at Hull City, beating the club record set by Peter Bonetti.[97]\n\nOn 18 March 2014, Čech made his 100th UEFA Champions League appearance in a 2–0 win over Galatasaray at Stamford Bridge. He became the fourth goalkeeper to make a century of appearances in the competition after Iker Casillas, Víctor Valdés and Oliver Kahn.[98]\n\nOn 22 April 2014, Čech was substituted in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid with a shoulder injury. Chelsea manager José Mourinho stated that the injury would prevent Čech from playing again in the 2013–14 season.[99] Despite the injury, Čech would finish the season as the joint winner of the Premier League Golden Glove award along with Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny, both keeping 16 clean sheets.[100]\n\nČech's place as Chelsea's starting goalkeeper was taken at the start of the season by Thibaut Courtois. This was possibly due to Čech's long standing injury concerns to his shoulder, back and knees.[101] On 24 September 2014, Čech made his first appearance of the season against Bolton in the third round of the League Cup, a 2–1 victory. He made his first league appearance of the season on 5 October, replacing the injured Courtois in the first half of a 2–0 home win over Arsenal.[102] His second start of the season came in the Champions League group stage victory against Slovenian side Maribor, keeping a clean sheet as Chelsea won 6–0.[103] With Courtois injured, Čech made his first league start of the season on 13 December against Hull, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win.[104]\n\nDespite him being second choice, Mourinho stated that Čech would not be sold in the January 2015 transfer window due to third-choice Mark Schwarzer leaving for Leicester City.[105] During that month, Čech made back to back starts in the Premier League against Newcastle United at home, followed by Swansea City away from home, keeping clean sheets in both wins.[106][107] On 1 March 2015, Čech started in goal in the 2015 Football League Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory to win the trophy for the third time in his career.[108]\n\nČech signed for Chelsea's Premier League rivals Arsenal on a four-year contract on 29 June 2015, for a fee of around £10 million.[110] His move saw him subjected to death threats by a few Chelsea supporters.[111] The departure of Wojciech Szczęsny to Roma on loan made Čech first-choice goalkeeper ahead of David Ospina. On 2 August, Čech won his first trophy with Arsenal after beating former side Chelsea 1–0 in the 2015 FA Community Shield.[112] A week later, he made his Premier League debut for Arsenal in a 2–0 home defeat to West Ham.[113] On 20 October, he made his first Champions League appearance for Arsenal in a 2–0 win against Bayern Munich.[114]\n\nČech recorded his 170th Premier League clean sheet in a 2–0 win against AFC Bournemouth on 28 December 2015, setting a new league record and overtaking previous record holder David James.[115][116] On 2 March 2016, he was sidelined due to a calf injury while playing against Swansea.[117] On 2 April, he returned as an unused substitute against Watford and returned to the pitch on 17 April against Crystal Palace in a narrow 1–1 draw[117] and guided Arsenal to its 500th Premier League win on 21 April against West Brom.[118] Marking the end of his debut season with Arsenal, he was named the Premier League Goalkeeper of the season by critics and platforms for winning the Golden Glove with an under-performing defence.[119]\n\nČech was given the captain's armband for Arsenal in their 4–3 opening day home loss to Liverpool.[120] In September 2016, he featured for the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 rout by Arsenal of his former side Chelsea at the Emirates.[121] On 24 April 2017, Čech played in the 2016–17 FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City at Wembley, which Arsenal won 2–1.[122] During this season, Cech received mild criticism among Arsenal fans for his inability to play with the ball at his feet but meanwhile he had the third most clearances among all goalkeepers in Premier League with 11 which manifested his transformation into a \"sweeper keeper\".[123] Čech again held the captain's armband on 10 May 2017 in a 2–0 win over Southampton at the St Mary's Stadium.[124] Čech was sidelined for the FA Cup Final due to injury, but Arsenal beat Chelsea 2–1.[125] Čech won his fifth FA Cup, and Arsenal became the most successful club in the history of the competition with 13 tournament wins.[126][127]\n\nČech was Arsenal's starting goalkeeper in the 2017 Community Shield, against his former club Chelsea; following a 1–1 draw after regulation time, Arsenal won the match in a 4–1 penalty shoot-out, in which neither keeper saved a spot kick.[129][130]\n\nČech then held the armband to captain Arsenal in their 4–3 opening day home win over Leicester City.[131]\n\nOn 11 March 2018, Čech became the first Premier League goalkeeper to keep 200 league clean sheets, after a match against Watford in which he saved a penalty from Troy Deeney.[132]\n\nČech started the season as the first choice in goal for new manager Unai Emery, but later lost his place to new signing Bernd Leno after suffering a hamstring injury during a match against Watford. On 15 January 2019, Čech announced via open letter on Twitter that he would retire at the end of the season.[133] On 29 May, he made the final appearance of his career in Arsenal's 4–1 defeat to his former club Chelsea in the 2019 UEFA Europa League final.[134] Several media outlets described him as Arsenal's Man of the Match.[135][136][137][138][139]\n\nČech started playing for the Czech Republic at youth level. He made a combined total of 34 appearances for age groups between under-15 and under-18 between 1998 and 2000. In 2000 he moved up to the under-20 and under-21 teams, making a total of 22 appearances across those teams.[140] Čech first came to prominence at the age of 20 at the 2002 U-21 European Championships, when he conceded only one penalty in a penalty shoot-out victory over France in the final, earning the Czech Republic their first title at youth level.[141]\n\nČech debuted for the senior squad in February 2002 against Hungary.[142] After establishing himself as the first choice goalkeeper, Čech was selected in the Czech Republic's squad for UEFA Euro 2004, where he was named in the all-star team as best goalkeeper at the tournament.[143]\n\nOn 17 October 2007, Čech captained the Czech Republic team in their Euro 2008 Group D qualifier against Germany.[citation needed] He kept a clean sheet and the Czechs defeated Germany 3–0 away to book their place for the finals in Austria and Switzerland. In the last group game of the final tournament, Čech was beaten three times in the final 15 minutes as Turkey overcame a two-goal deficit to knock the Czechs out. Čech had a cross slip through his hands, allowing Nihat Kahveci to score Turkey's equalising goal.[144]\n\nOn 29 May 2012, Čech was named in the Czech Republic's squad for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.[145] In the Czech Republic's group match against Greece, a fumble from Čech allowed the Greeks a goal.[146] Čech deputised for the injured Tomáš Rosický as captain in the final group match against Poland, as the Czech Republic qualified for the quarter-finals with a 1–0 victory.[147] Čech's captaincy continued in the quarter-final, where the Czechs lost to Portugal through a 79th-minute Cristiano Ronaldo goal.[148]\n\nOn 26 March 2013, Čech made his 100th appearance for the Czech Republic, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 win over Armenia.[149] Čech equalled the national record of former teammate Karel Poborský on 17 November 2015, when he earned his 118th appearance in a 3–1 loss to neighbours Poland in Wrocław.[150] The following 27 May, he took the record outright by playing in a 6–0 friendly victory over Malta.[151]\n\nOn 8 July 2016, Čech announced his retirement from international football. He is the most capped player in the history of the Czech team, with 124 caps.[152]\n\nIn June 2019, Čech returned to former club Chelsea as a technical and performance advisor.[153]\n\nIn October 2020, Čech was included in Chelsea's 25-man Premier League squad for the 2020–21 season.[154] The club announced that Čech was included as an emergency goalkeeper and as a non-contract player, and that this was a precautionary move due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[155] He made one appearance for Chelsea's under-23 team in the Premier League 2.[156]\n\nDuring a protest against the proposed European Super League outside Stamford Bridge on 20 April 2021, Čech approached fans who were blocking the team bus and could be heard saying \"give us time\".[157][158] The fans did move and the team bus was able to enter after a short delay.[159] Later that day, Chelsea were among the first clubs to withdraw from the league.[160][161]\n\nIn June 2022, Čech left Chelsea after Todd Boehly took over the club.[162][163]\n\nOn 9 October 2019, Čech signed for ice hockey side Guildford Phoenix of the National Ice Hockey League Division 2 (level 4 of British hockey) as a goaltender.[164] He chose to wear number 39 jersey in honour of Dominik Hašek.[165] Čech said he would continue his role as a technical and performance advisor at Chelsea whilst playing ice hockey in his spare time.[166] He was named the man of the match on his ice hockey debut on 13 October, after stopping two penalty shots in a shoot-out victory, and making several other crucial saves.[167][168] After winning a treble with Guildford Phoenix in the 2021–22 season,[169] Čech signed for the National Ice Hockey League Division 1 side Chelmsford Chieftains in November 2022.[170] In June 2023, after one season with Chelmsford, he signed for fellow Division 1 side Oxford City Stars.[171]\n\nIn the 2023 off-season, Čech played for the Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) defending champions, Belfast Giants, in a charity match to support the continuation of ice hockey in Ukraine (amid the Russo-Ukrainian War), raising £65,000.[172] In November 2023, he joined the club on loan as temporary emergency cover.[173][174] In an interview with the Belfast Telegraph, Čech revealed that he used to play youth ice hockey in addition to football, but equipment costs forced him to play the significantly cheaper sport of football. He also stated that ice hockey was his preferred sport as a child.[175] Čech made his first and only appearance for the Giants during his initial loan spell in a 5–1 win over the Glasgow Clan on 25 November, playing for the final five minutes of the game in relief of starting goaltender Tyler Beskorowany, and making one save.[176][177] He returned to his parent club in December before re-signing for the Giants on loan for a second time in the 2023–24 season in February 2024.[178]\n\nSince his emergence as a precocious talent in his youth, Čech has been considered to be one of the greatest, most consistent, and most respected goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time.[179][180][181][182][183] A tall, athletic, agile, brave, physically strong, and well-rounded keeper, with a strong mentality, as well as good decision-making and leadership qualities; throughout his career he has stood out for his reflexes and shot-stopping abilities, as well as his positional sense, concentration, defence organisation, handling when coming off his line to claim crosses, and command of his area.[nb 3]\n\nAlthough Čech is not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career,[196] he possesses a deep kick with either foot, despite being naturally left-footed. His ability to produce deep kicks and long throws came to use in his Chelsea days for starting quick counter-attacks which were an important part of their game.[197][198][199] In his later career, he often functioned as a sweeper keeper, due to his ability to rush off his line, anticipate opponents who had beaten the offside trap, and clear the ball away from danger.[123] Čech is also known for his penalty-saving abilities. Some examples of his penalty saves in high-profile matches include those made in the 2012 UEFA Champions League final, the 2010 FA Cup final, and his penalty save against Blackburn during the 2004–05 season, which helped him beat Peter Schmeichel's Premier League record of 694 minutes without conceding a goal.[200] He cited fellow goalkeepers Oliver Kahn, Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar as inspirations in his early career.[201]\n\nČech is considered to be one of the greatest goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time, as well as one of the best keepers in Premier League history, and has earned praise from several players, pundits, and managers due to his goalkeeping ability.[11][179][180][181][182][183] Fellow goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon named Čech as the best goalkeeper of his era, saying: \"The best goalkeeper with his feet? Pepe Reina. In the air I'd say Neuer. With his hands: Casillas. The best overall I'd say is Čech.\"[202] Iker Casillas instead described him as, \"One of the best goalkeepers I have ever seen\" via his Twitter account.[5] Former Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger and goalkeeper Jens Lehmann have hailed him as \"one of the greatest of all time\".[203] Journalist Alan Tyers of The Telegraph described Čech as the \"Premier League's best-ever goalkeeper\" in 2019.[6]\n\nČech currently holds two Guinness World Records for the most clean sheets in English Premier League history, and for winning the Premier League Golden Glove Award with two different clubs.[204] Nathan Baxter, Martin Dúbravka, Marek Rodák and João Virgínia are some of the goalkeepers who have described him as their idol.[205][206][207][208] In 2011, Čech was voted the third best goalkeeper of the first decade of 21st century by IFFHS. He also has the third highest number of clean sheets (391) since 2000s among all goalkeepers.[209][210] Former Premier League striker and record-goalscorer Alan Shearer named Čech in his Premier League's Team of the Decade in 2019.[211][212]\n\nČech was born a triplet along with his sister Šárka and brother Michal in Plzeň, Czechoslovakia (present day Czech Republic).[213] He has a weaker skull as a result of being a triplet.[214]\n\nČech married Martina Dolejšová (now Čechová) (born 1982), also of Czech nationality, in June 2003.[215] They have a daughter Adéla, born in 2008,[215] and a son Damián, born in 2009.[216]\n\nHe is a keen musician and plays the drums. He has a YouTube channel under his own name on which he posts video drum covers, including Incubus' \"Anna Molly\",[217] as well as songs by Coldplay and Foo Fighters. He has played with Roger Taylor of Queen.[218] In May 2019, he and Taylor released a charity single called That's Football.[219] In 2020, he joined folk rock band Wills & The Willing as their drummer, filming their music video \"Iceberg\".[220]\n\nAlong with his native language Czech, Čech also speaks English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.[221][222][223][224]\n• Most Premier League clean sheets at one club: 162 with Chelsea. 272\n• Most Premier League clean sheets in a season: 24 in 2004–05. 273\n• First Premier League goalkeeper to go 1000 minutes without conceding a goal. 272\n• Only goalkeeper to have won the Premier League Golden Glove with different clubs. 272\n• Most Czech Footballer of the Year wins: 9 wins. 279\n• Most Premier League appearances for Chelsea by a foreign player: 333 appearances. 282\n• Most Premier League wins for Chelsea by a foreign player: 219 wins. 282\n• Most appearances for Chelsea by a foreign player: 494 appearances. 283\n• Most penalty saves for Chelsea by a foreign player: 8 penalty saves. 284\n• Most starts for Chelsea in a season: 63 starts in 2012–13. 285\n• Most major cup final appearances for Chelsea: 14 (shared with Frank Lampard). 285\n• Most clean sheets in a season for Chelsea: 28 clean sheets in 2004–05. 286\n• Most consecutive clean sheets for Chelsea in all competitions: 7 in 2005–06 (shared record). 284\n• Most consecutive home league clean sheets for Chelsea: 9 in 2009–10 - 2010–11 (shared record). 284\n• Most consecutive home clean sheets for Chelsea in all competitions: 10 in 2009–10. 284\n• Most consecutive league clean sheets for Chelsea: 10 in 2004–05. 284\n• Most league clean sheets in a season for Chelsea: 24 in 2004–05. 284\n• Most away league clean sheets in a season for Chelsea: 11 in 2004–05 & 2005–06. 284\n• Most UEFA Best Club Goalkeeper Awards for a Premier League goalkeeper: 3 awards.\n• One of four goalkeepers to have made consecutive appearances in the ESM Team of the Year (shared with Angelo Peruzzi, Oliver Kahn, and Manuel Neuer).\n• List of footballers with 100 or more UEFA Champions League appearances\n• List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps\n• Petr Čech at FAČR (also at old FAČR website)"}

From July 1992 until the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in January 1993, he served as the second and last prime minister of the Czech Republic while it was a federal subject of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, and then as the first prime minister of the newly independent Czech Republic from 1993 to 1998.\n\nDuring the Communist era, Klaus worked as a bank clerk and forecaster. After the fall of Communism in November 1989, he became the Minister of Finance in the \"government of national unity\". In 1991, Klaus was the principal co-founder of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS).[1] He was prime minister from 1992 to 1997, and from January to February 1993 he held certain powers of the Presidency.\n\nHis government fell in the autumn of 1997; after the elections in the spring of 1998, he became the president of the Chamber of Deputies (1998–2002). After ODS lost the parliamentary elections of 2002, he withdrew from politics briefly, before being elected President of the Czech Republic in February 2003. He was re-elected in 2008 for a second five-year term. His presidency was marked by many controversies over his strong opinions on issues ranging from global warming denial to Euroscepticism,[2] and a wide-ranging amnesty declared in his last months of office, triggering his indictment by the Czech Senate on charges of high treason.\n\nKlaus left active politics after his second presidential term ended in March 2013 but continues to comment on domestic and foreign policy issues. His political views have been referred to as Klausism.\n\nKlaus was born in Prague during the Nazi occupation, and grew up in the large, then middle-class neighbourhood of Vinohrady. Klaus has claimed that he helped build barricades during the Prague uprising in May 1945, at the age of three.[3]\n\nKlaus studied Economics of Foreign Trade at the University of Economics, Prague, graduating in 1963. He also spent some time at universities in Italy (1966) and at Cornell University in the United States in 1969. He then pursued a postgraduate academic career at the State Institute of Economics of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, which, according to his autobiography, he was forced to leave in 1970.[4]\n\nSoon after that he was employed by the Czechoslovak State Bank, where he held various staff positions from 1971 to 1986, as well as working abroad in various Soviet-aligned countries, usually considered a privilege at the time.[4] In 1987, Klaus joined the Institute for Prognostics of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.[citation needed]\n\nKlaus entered Czechoslovak politics during the Velvet Revolution in 1989, during the second week of the political uprising, when he offered his services as an economic advisor to the Civic Forum, whose aim was to unify the anti-government movements in Czechoslovakia and overthrow the Communist regime. Klaus became Czechoslovakia's Minister of Finance in the \"government of national unity\" on 10 December 1989.\n\nIn October 1990, Klaus was elected chairman of the Civic Forum. Two months later, he led supporters of a free-market economy into the break-away Civic Democratic Party (Czech: Občanská demokratická strana or ODS). Following a period of strong economic growth, Klaus led ODS to the largest vote share (29.73%) in Czech legislative elections on 5–6 June 1992. ODS emerged as by far the largest party, with 76 seats, and Klaus thus became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the Czech Republic.\n\nODS also performed strongly in the Czechoslovak federal election held the same day, becoming the largest party with 48 seats, double the number of the runners-up, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). However, ODS would still have needed support from HZDS to form a government. When he began coalition talks with HZDS leader Vladimir Meciar, Klaus told Meciar that unless HZDS was willing to agree to a tighter federation, the only alternative was for the Czechs and Slovaks to form independent nations. As Meciar was unwilling to agree to the former option, on 23 July the two leaders agreed to dissolve Czechoslovakia, to take effect on 1 January 1993.\n\nKlaus led ODS to be the party with the largest vote share (29.62%) in the 1996 legislative elections, and remained prime minister in a minority government. However, towards the end of 1997 he was forced to step down as prime minister by opponents in his party in connection with accusations of funding irregularities in the ODS.[5]\n\nDuring his term as prime minister, President Václav Havel heavily criticized Klaus' policy of voucher privatization of previously state-owned enterprises. The policy was designed to bring about a speedy transition from command economy to free-market economy, but Havel cited the voucher privatization as a cause of the country's subsequent economic problems.[citation needed]\n\nAt a party congress in late 1997, Klaus was re-elected as chairman of ODS by 227 votes to 72 votes. The defeated faction subsequently left ODS, and in early 1998 established a new party, the Freedom Union (Czech: Unie svobody), with President Havel's support.[citation needed]\n\nODS finished second in early elections in 1998, behind the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD). Either party could have formed a majority with the support of other parties, but Freedom Union chairman Jan Ruml, despite his animosity to Klaus, refused to support ČSSD. Instead, Klaus negotiated the \"Opposition Agreement\" (Czech: opoziční smlouva) with ČSSD chairman Miloš Zeman, his long-time political adversary. During the following legislative period, ODS allowed Zeman's ČSSD to rule with a minority government, in exchange for a number of parliamentary posts, including the post of the President of the Chamber of Deputies, occupied by Klaus himself.[6] The Opposition Agreement led to public demonstrations, particularly against an attempt to regulate Czech Television. This led Zeman to announce that he would not stand again for the post of prime minister.[citation needed]\n\nIn the elections of June 2002, ODS was again defeated by ČSSD under their new leader Vladimír Špidla, who had previously opposed the Opposition Agreement, and instead formed a coalition with centrist parties. After a long period of deliberation, and even though ODS won Senate elections in October 2002, Klaus did not run for re-election as party chairman at the December ODS congress. However, he was made honorary chairman of the party.[7] Against his declared preference, Klaus was succeeded as party leader by Mirek Topolánek.[8]\n\nHaving lost two general elections in a row, Klaus announced his intention to step down from the leadership and run for president to succeed his political opponent Václav Havel. The governing coalition was unable to agree on a common candidate to oppose him.[citation needed]\n\nKlaus was elected President of the Czech Republic on 28 February 2003, in the third round of the election, in which both chambers vote together at a joint session of the Parliament by secret ballot between the two top candidates.[citation needed] He won with a majority of 142 votes out of 281. It was widely reported that Klaus won due to the support of Communist Members of Parliament, support which his opponent, Jan Sokol, had publicly refused to accept. Klaus denied that he owed the Communists any debt for his election.[9]\n\nAlthough Klaus regularly criticized Václav Havel for using his Presidential Veto powers to block laws and promised restraint, he used his veto more frequently than Havel.[10] He vetoed the Anti-Discrimination Law passed by parliament in 2008, describing it as a dangerous threat to personal freedoms. He also vetoed a bill implementing the European Union's Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals policy, saying it was a burden for private businesses.\n\nKlaus' Euroscepticism, alongside his scepticism of human impact on the environment and climate change, formed the cornerstones of his policy as president.[citation needed] He expressed the opinion that accession to the European Union would mean a significant reduction of Czech sovereignty, and did not endorse either side in the 2003 accession referendum, in which 77% voted yes.[citation needed]\n\nKlaus has alleged a gradual loss of sovereignty for member states in favour of the EU. He promoted the publication of a text by the Irish Eurosceptic Anthony Coughlan. In 2005 Klaus called for the EU to be \"scrapped\" and replaced by a free trade area to be called the \"Organisation of European States\". He also claimed that the EU as an institution undermines freedom, calling the EU \"as big a threat to freedom as the Soviet Union was\".[citation needed] In 2005 he remarked to a group of visiting politicians from the United States that the EU was a \"failed and bankrupt entity\".[citation needed]\n\nIn November 2008, during a stay in Ireland after a state visit, Klaus held a joint press conference with Declan Ganley, head of Libertas, which was at that time campaigning for a \"no\" vote in a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. Members of the Irish government called this an \"inappropriate intervention\", and \"unusual and disappointing\".[11]\n\nOn 5 December 2008, members of the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament visited the Czech Republic prior to the start of the Czech presidency of the European Union. They were invited by Václav Klaus to meet him at Prague Castle. The chairman of Green Group, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, brought a European flag and presented it to Klaus.[12] Cohn-Bendit also said that he \"did not care about Klaus' opinions on the Lisbon Treaty, that Klaus would simply have to sign it\". This was criticised by some Czech commentators as \"undue interference in Czech affairs\".[citation needed]\n\nAt the same meeting, Irish MEP Brian Crowley told Klaus that the Irish people wanted ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon and were \"insulted\" by Klaus' association with Declan Ganley and Libertas. Klaus responded that \"the biggest insult to the Irish people is not to accept the results of the Irish referendum\".[13] Crowley replied, \"You will not tell me what the Irish think. As an Irishman, I know it best\".[13] British Eurosceptic journalist Christopher Booker wrote that the meeting \"confirms the inability of the Euro-elite to accept that anyone holds views different from their own\".[12]\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Klaus made a speech to the European Parliament where he criticized what he perceived as the European Union's lack of democracy, continuing integration and economic policies:\n\nAfter this point was made, a number of MEPs walked out of the chamber.[16][17] Klaus continued:\n\nKlaus was a frequent critic of centrally implemented economic policies in the European Union, and of the adoption of the Euro as the common currency of the eurozone countries. Around the 10th anniversary of the euro in 2008 he wrote in the Financial Times that \"in practice, the existence of the euro has shown that forcing an economically disparate Europe into a homogeneous entity through a political decision is political engineering par excellence, far from beneficial for all countries concerned\".[18]\n\nKlaus long refused to sign the Treaty of Lisbon, and was the last head of state in the EU to provide a signature. Other European leaders ignored his reluctance, stating that they would not consent to being \"held hostage\" by the Czech President.[19] The Czech Prime Minister Jan Fischer, however, said that Klaus would eventually sign the treaty, saying: \"There is no reason for anxiety in Europe. The question is not Yes or No, it is only when\".[20]\n\nIn November 2008 Klaus said in an interview with the Czech Television that if he was the only person standing in the way of a treaty that all others agreed upon, he would not block it.[21] Václav Klaus signed the Treaty of Lisbon on 3 November 2009.[22] However he never signed the addition to the Lisbon Treaty, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), which was eventually signed by his successor as president, Miloš Zeman.[23][clarification needed]\n\nKlaus has sought cooperation with Russia on issues including energy policy.[4][24]\n\nIn the 1990s, Klaus promoted renewed oil and gas agreements between the Czech Republic and Russia, and opposed Czech attempts to develop other energy sources,[24] including the construction of a pipeline between the Czech Republic and Germany. According to former Czech secret service directors, he was warned by the secret service of Russian organized crime spreading into the Czech economy. In one scheme, oil was imported to the Czech Republic as heating oil and re-sold as diesel, creating huge profits for Russian businessman Semion Mogilevich, alleged to be a key figure in the Russian mafia.[4]\n\nIn March 2006, Klaus was described by The Economist as one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"warmest admirers abroad\".[25] Klaus was awarded the 2007 Pushkin Medal by Putin for the promotion of Russian culture. It was suggested that this was partly due to his use of the Russian language when speaking to Putin and Russian diplomats.[26][27][28] Klaus said that in relations with Russia there have been \"challenges and successes, tremendous successes\".[29]\n\nOn the other hand, in a May 2009 interview with Lidové noviny,[30] Klaus said that Russia was not a threat, but was still a big, strong and ambitious country, of which the Czech authorities should beware more than countries like Estonia and Lithuania should.[31]\n\nKlaus criticised NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War,[24] and was subsequently a frequent critic of the unilateral Kosovo declaration of independence. During a visit to Slovakia in March 2008, Klaus stated his disagreement with the argument that Kosovo was an exceptional case, and suggested that the precedent set by the recognition of Kosovo would open a \"Pandora's box\" in Europe, leading to disastrous consequences. He compared the situation of Serbia to the 1938 Munich Agreement.[32][33] When Serbia recalled its ambassador in protest at the Czech government's recognition of Kosovo, Klaus invited the Serbian ambassador to Prague Castle for a friendly farewell.[34] During a visit to Serbia in January 2011, Klaus stated that as long as he was president the Czech Republic would not appoint an ambassador to Kosovo.[35]\n\nUnlike previous Czech presidential elections, the election of 2008 was conducted using on the record voting rather than a secret ballot. This change was demanded by several Czech political parties after the previous elections in 2003, but opposed by Klaus' ODS,[36] which, having strengthened since 2003, had a comfortable majority in the Senate on its own, and only needed to secure a few votes in the House for the third round.\n\nKlaus' opponent was the former émigré, naturalized United States citizen and University of Michigan economics professor Jan Švejnar.[37] He was nominated by the Green Party as a pro-EU moderate candidate, and also gained the support of the leading opposition Social Democratic Party, a small number of deputies and senators of KDU-ČSL and some independent Senators. The first ballot on 8–9 February 2008 resulted in no winner. Švejnar won the Chamber of Deputies, but Klaus led in the assembly as a whole and only just failed to achieve the required majority.[36]\n\nThe second ballot on 15 February 2008 included a new candidate MEP Jana Bobošíková, nominated by the Communist Party. However, without any further support, she withdrew her candidacy before the election,[37] and the second round ended similarly to the previous one, with Klaus remaining on 141 votes. Therefore, in the third round, where only a simple majority of all legislators present from both houses was required, Klaus won by one vote, with Švejnar receiving 111 votes, and the 29 Communists voting for neither.[38]\n\nKlaus's first term as president concluded on 7 March 2008, and he took his oath for the second term on the same day so as to avoid an interim without a president and allow Parliament to come to a joint session earlier. He therefore lost the day of overlap, meaning his second term ended on 6 March 2013.\n\nVáclav Klaus resigned as Honorary Chairman of ODS at the party congress on 6 December 2008.[39] The following day his ally Pavel Bém, the Mayor of Prague, lost a vote for the post of ODS chairman against Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, by 284 votes to 162.[39]\n\nIn April 2011, Klaus was seen taking a pen during a state visit to Chile.[40] The alleged theft, caught on television cameras, was widely reported around the world.[41][42] According to Klaus, the incident was exaggerated, as official pens are normally free to be taken by official visitors, including in this case.[43]\n\nA spokeswoman for Chilean President Sebastián Piñera said the Chilean President's guests were free to take the pens from meetings.[44][45]\n\nIn July 2011, President Klaus visited Canberra, Australia. The visit was sponsored by the conservative Australian think tank, the Centre for Independent Studies, and so was not afforded the diplomatic protocol of an official visit. While in Canberra Klaus was invited to an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in their Parliament House studios. On his arrival Klaus was requested to undergo the standard security clearance procedures required for normal members of the public; ABC staff tried to convince security staff to allow the President to bypass security but they refused, and so Klaus left the building.[46]\n\nKlaus stated that it was not an issue of his passing through the electronic security system, but rather his treatment by the officials, as nobody had been there to meet him when he and his entourage arrived. After waiting for ten minutes in front of the building, a worker of the ABC Television invited him in, where he was left \"among perhaps as many as hundred school children\". After another few minutes he found out that the whole group was waiting for a security clearance. Klaus refused to waste more time waiting in line behind the school children and offered ABC Television to conduct the interview in his hotel. This offer was declined by ABC as they were already set up for the interview in the Parliament House studio.[46][47]\n\nKlaus' approach was supported by the head of protocol in the Office of the Czech President, Jindřich Forejt, who described the incident as \"incredible\". Former spokesman for President Václav Havel, Ladislav Špaček,[48] said that \"it is absolutely out of place to check a head of state; it is disrespectful. I am not at all surprised that Klaus turned around and went off. He should not be there trying to argue with some operative that he is not a terrorist\".[49]\n\nKlaus' aide said that \"The prepared Prague gay carnival is a pressure action and a political demonstration of a world with deformed values,\" describing homosexuals as \"deviants.\"[50] The comments attracted widespread criticism from Czech politicians across the political spectrum, as well as from thirteen ambassadors. Klaus defended his aide's comments. Criticizing \"homosexualism\", he said that homosexuality is something to be tolerated but not celebrated.[51][52][53]\n\nOn 28 September 2012, Klaus was attacked during a bridge opening ceremony in Chrastava.[54] While Klaus was walking through a thick crowd, shaking hands and chatting with bystanders, a 26-year-old man, Pavel Vondrouš, approached him and pressed an airsoft gun against the President's right arm, pulling the trigger seven times before disappearing into the crowd. Klaus was taken to the Military Hospital in Prague with what was described as \"minor bruising\" for treatment before being discharged. The attacker, a supporter of the Communist Party,[55] was detained after several minutes, but later released. Before he was taken into custody, he told journalists that he had done it \"because politicians were blind and deaf to the people's despair\". Vondrouš received a suspended sentence in June 2013.[56]\n\nThe lack of action from the President's bodyguards was heavily criticised, and the head of the President's security resigned after the incident.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, using his constitutional powers, Klaus announced an amnesty to mark the 20th anniversary of the Czech Republic's independence. The amnesty took effect on 2 January and released all prisoners sentenced to one year or less whose sentences had not been served, and all prisoners over 75 years of age sentenced to ten years or less whose sentences had not been served, as well as cancelling all court proceedings which had been ongoing for longer than eight years.[57] By 11 January 6,318 prisoners had been released due to the amnesty, with other cases pending the outcome of court appeals.[58] In addition, dozens of high-profile long-running corruption trials ended due to the amnesty, causing the greatest public anger.[59]\n\nThe extent of the amnesty was widely criticized in the Czech Republic, with the opposition demanding a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Petr Nečas, who countersigned it.[60] Meanwhile, a comparison was drawn with actions taken by Klaus's predecessor, Václav Havel, who ordered three amnesties while Czechoslovak and later Czech president (1989–2003). Havel's first amnesty of January 1990 was the largest post-war amnesty, freeing around 23,000 people, two-thirds of the total prison population of 31,000, on the grounds that they had been convicted by a communist court system.[57]\n\nThe amnesty sparked a public petition to persuade the Senate of the Czech Republic to charge President Klaus with high treason before the Constitutional court,[59] effectively impeaching him.[61] Within 24 hours of its launch, it had accumulated 24,500 signatures, and by the beginning of February 2013, the petition had been signed by more than 64,000 people.[62] On 4 March 2013, the Senate voted to charge Klaus with high treason, based on five cases in which he was alleged to have violated the constitution, including the amnesty, his refusal to sign the European stability mechanism and his alleged procrastination in nominating judges to the Constitutional Court. The following day, on 5 March, the Constitutional Court rejected a previous motion by a smaller group of senators to cancel the New Year amnesty, thereby removing the issue of the amnesty from the constitutional suit.[63] Given that the sanction for treason committed by the Czech President is the loss of office, and Klaus' term was due to end the following day, the court's verdict was a mere formality,[64] but a guilty verdict would make Klaus ineligible for a third term of office in 2018.[65] Klaus described the move as an attempt by his political opponents to tarnish his presidency.\n\nAfter his presidency ended in 2013, Klaus was named a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute.[66] His fellowship was terminated in September 2014, due to his views on the Revolution of Dignity, his hostility to homosexuality, and support for European far-right parties.[67]\n\nOn 9 September 2014, in an interview with Czech radio station Radio Impuls, Klaus said that Ukraine is an artificially created state and that the Russian intervention in the country was part of a civil war.[68] He continued by describing Maidan as an \"artificial event created by the West and the United States\", in which Russia was forced to intervene.[68] He added that in his opinion, Ukraine lacks the strong ties to keep the country together.[68]\n\nIn the 2018 presidential election, Klaus endorsed his former political opponent Miloš Zeman.[69]\n\nIn November 2024, Klaus received media attention after stating on CNN Prima News that female defence ministers are \"absurd nonsense\".[70]\n\nKlaus' son Václav Klaus Jr. was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the 2017 election as a member of the Civic Democratic Party. Klaus Jr. was expelled from the party in 2019 following comments in which he compared EU directives to the Holocaust. He founded a new party, the Tricolour Citizens' Movement. Václav Klaus joined Tricolour and became the party's foreign relations adviser.[71][72]\n\nOn 28 October 2020, at a celebration of the formation of an independent Czechoslovak state in 1918, Klaus refused to wear a face mask, in breach of COVID-19 restrictions introduced by Andrej Babiš' government. Klaus described people who wear face masks as supporters of illegal migration, a more powerful European Union and a rapid adoption of the Euro currency.[73] In response, the Prague Public Health Office fined Klaus 10,000 CZK for not wearing a face mask in public.[74] In February 2021 Klaus tested positive for COVID-19.[75] He received treatment at home,[76] and concluded quarantine on 6 March 2021.[77]\n\nIn 1995, while prime minister, Klaus was awarded the title of Professor of Finance by his alma mater, the University of Economics, Prague. Since then Klaus has occasionally given economics seminars at the university, focused on his free-market views.\n\nHis defining feature as an economist since 1990 has been his enthusiasm for free market economics, as exemplified by Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman.[78] According to Klaus, legislation and institutions cannot be created before economic transformation, they have to go hand in hand.[79]\n\nSince 1990, Václav Klaus has received nearly 50 honorary degrees, including from Universidad Francisco Marroquín,[80] and published more than 20 books on various social, political, and economic topics. Klaus is a member of the Mont Pelerin Society. He has published articles in the libertarian Cato Journal. On 28 May 2008, Klaus gave the keynote address at an annual dinner hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free market advocacy group in Washington, D.C., and received its Julian L. Simon Memorial Award.\n\nKlaus was elected to become a foreign member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 2009.[81]\n\nKlaus denies that global warming is anthropogenic. He has described the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as \"a group of politicized scientists with one-sided opinions and one-sided assignments\",[82] and has claimed that some other top-level politicians do not publicly express their doubts about global warming being anthropogenic because \"a whip of political correctness strangles their voices\".[83]\n\nAddressing the Cato Institute in Washington in March 2007, Klaus expressed the view that \"Environmentalism should belong in the social sciences, along with other \"isms\" such as communism, feminism, and liberalism\", and compared environmentalism to a religion, or a \"modern counterpart of communism that seeks to change peoples' habits and economic systems\".[82]\n\nIn a June 2007 article in the Financial Times, Klaus described environmentalism as \"the biggest threat to freedom, democracy, a market economy and prosperity\". He said that current political and scientific debates on environment issues were designed to suppress freedom and democracy, and asked readers to oppose the term \"scientific consensus\", adding that \"it is always achieved only by a loud minority, never by a silent majority\".[84] In an online Q&A session following the article he wrote \"Environmentalism, not preservation of nature (and of environment), is a leftist ideology... Environmentalism is indeed a vehicle for bringing us socialist government at the global level. Again, my life in communism has made me oversensitive in this respect\".[85] He reiterated these statements at a showing of Martin Durkin's The Great Global Warming Swindle organised by his think tank CEP in June 2007.[86]\n\nIn November 2007, on BBC World's HARDtalk, Klaus called the interviewer \"absolutely arrogant\" for saying that a scientific consensus had been reached on climate change that included most of the world. He added that he was \"absolutely certain\" that in 30 years people would look back and be grateful to him for his stand on the issue.[87]\n\nAt the September 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Klaus restated his rejection of global warming, calling for a second IPCC to be established to produce competing reports, and for countries to be left alone to set their priorities and prepare their own plans for the problem.[88]\n\nIn 2007, Klaus published a book entitled Modrá, nikoli zelená planeta (literally: \"Blue planet – not green\"), which has been translated into various languages.[89] It was published in English under the title Blue Planet in Green Shackles. The book claims that \"the theory of global warming and the hypothesis on its causes, which has spread around massively nowadays, may be a bad theory, it may also be a valueless theory, but in any case it is a very dangerous theory\".\n\nAt the September 2009 UN Climate Change Conference, Klaus again spoke against the conference, calling the gathering \"propagandistic\" and \"undignified\".[90]\n\nOn 26 July 2011, at the National Press Club Address, Klaus described global warming as \"a communist conspiracy\".[91] On 21 May 2012, Klaus addressed the climate sceptic Heartland Institute's Seventh International Conference on Climate Change (ICCC-7).[92] In August 2012 he delivered the Magistral Lecture to the World Federation of Scientists in Erice, Sicily.[93]\n\nVáclav Klaus is married to Livia Klausová, a Slovak economist. They have two sons, Václav, also a politician, and Jan, an economist, and five grandchildren.[1]\n• Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (28 October 2019)\n• Former ex-officio Sovereign of the Order of the White Lion (7 March 2003–7 March 2013)\n• Former ex-officio Sovereign of the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (7 March 2003–7 March 2013)\n• Austria: Grand Star of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria (15 May 2009) 94\n• Lithuania: Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of Vytautas the Great (9 April 2009) 95\n• Poland: Knight of the Order of the White Eagle (10 July 2007)\n• Russia: Recipient of the Medal of Pushkin (27 December 2007)\n• Slovakia: First Class of the Order of the White Double Cross (6 March 2013)\n• Spain: Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (24 September 2004) 96\n• Albania:Doctor Honoris Causa University of Tirana, For the valuable contribution to the development of the Albanian state, 2010\n• Biography and selected speeches at the President's officeWhy Vaclav Klaus divides Czechs: Vaclav Klaus - free market devotee and the bane of Brussels bureaucrats - will step down on 7 March after 23 years at the top of Czech politics.

He deserves nothing else.\"Vladimír Mečiar - Wikipedia: Vladimír Mečiar (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈʋlaɟimiːr ˈmetʂɪɐr]; born 26 July 1942) is a Slovak former politician who served as the prime minister of Slovakia from June 1990 to May 1991, June 1992 to March 1994, and again from December 1994 to October 1998. He was the leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), a populist party in Slovakia.\n\nMečiar led Slovakia during the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992–93 and was one of the leading presidential candidates in Slovakia in 1999 and 2004. During his time in office, he was criticized for his autocratic style of governance and connections to organized crime, which became known as Mečiarizmus (\"Mečiarism\").[1][2][3]\n\nMečiar was born in Detva in 1942 as the eldest of four boys. His father was a tailor, and his mother was a housewife.\n\nStarting in the Communist Party of Slovakia, the only road to prominence in Communist Czechoslovakia, he became committee chairman in the town of Žiar nad Hronom, only to be dismissed in the year after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, when he delivered a pro-reform speech to the national congress in 1969 and was thrown out. A year later he was also expelled from the Communist Party and then added to the Communist Party Central Committee's long list of enemies of the socialist regime. He put himself through the Faculty of Law of the Comenius University while working in a glass factory.\n\nIn late 1989, during the fast-paced anti-Communist Velvet Revolution, he joined the new political party, Public Against Violence (Verejnosť proti násiliu, VPN), which was the Slovak counterpart to the better-known Czech Civic Forum. On 11 January 1990, when the VPN was looking for professionals to participate in the government of Slovakia, Mečiar was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Environment of Slovakia on a recommendation of Alexander Dubček, who was impressed by Mečiar's thorough knowledge in all relevant fields.[4]\n\nAfter the first democratic elections in Czechoslovakia in June 1990, he was named Slovak prime minister (representing the VPN) of a coalition government of VPN and the Christian Democratic Movement. He advocated economic reform and continued federation with the Czechs.\n\nIn 1990 the political landscape of the Czech Republic and Slovakia started to develop and many new political parties were formed, mainly from the Civic Forum and the VPN. By the end of 1990, some of Mečiar's partners in the VPN began distancing themselves from him. First, the party split into two fractions in early March 1991: Mečiar supporters (mostly members of his cabinet) and Mečiar opponents (led by the VPN chairman Fedor Gál). On 23 April 1991, the Presidium of the Slovak parliament (Slovak National Council) deposed him as premier of Slovakia and he was replaced by Ján Čarnogurský, the leader of the Christian Democratic Movement. Three days later, the VPN officially split in two: the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the remaining VPN (since October 1991 called ODÚ-VPN, later just ODÚ). Mečiar was elected HZDS chairman in June 1991.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992, there were frequent, but fruitless, negotiations between the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic concerning the future relations between the two constituent republics of Czechoslovakia. The winners of the June 1992 elections in Czechoslovakia and new prime ministers were the Civic Democratic Party led by Václav Klaus in the Czech Republic and the HZDS led by Vladimír Mečiar in Slovakia. Before and shortly after this election, the HZDS supported the creation of a looser federation—a confederation—between the two republics.[5] However, its Czech counterpart wanted an even more centralized Czechoslovakia than was the case in 1992 or two separate countries.[citation needed] Since these two concepts were irreconcilable, Mečiar and Klaus agreed (after intense negotiations, but without having consulted the population in a referendum) on 23 July in Bratislava to dissolve Czechoslovakia and to create two independent states. As a result, Mečiar and Klaus became the prime ministers of two independent states on 1 January 1993. Mečiar also opposed the free-market shock therapy proposed by Prague and Klaus' party to all of Czechoslovakia.[6]\n\nAfter eight members of the parliament left the HZDS in March 1993, Mečiar lost his parliamentary majority. At the same time Mečiar's HZDS also lost the support of the president, Michal Kováč, who was originally nominated by the HZDS. However, it was only in March 1994 that he was unseated as prime minister by the parliament (National Council of the Slovak Republic) and the opposition parties created a new government under Jozef Moravčík's lead. However, after the elections held at the turn of September and October 1994, in which his HZDS won 35% of the votes, he became prime minister again — in a coalition with the far-right Slovak National Party headed by the controversial Ján Slota, and the radical-left Združenie robotníkov Slovenska headed by the colourful Ján Ľupták, a mason.\n\nDuring the following period, he was constantly criticized by his opponents and Western countries for an autocratic style of administration, lack of respect for democracy, misuse of state media for propaganda, corruption and the shady privatization of national companies that occurred during his rule. Privatization during the 1990s in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic was harmed by widespread unlawful asset stripping (also described by the journalistic term of tunnelling).\n\nAt the same time relations between Mečiar and the President of Slovakia, Michal Kováč were rather strained. He was also blamed for having engaged the Slovak secret service (SIS) in the abduction of the President's son Michal Kováč, Jr. — wanted on a warrant for a financial crime in Germany — to Hainburg, Austria, in August 1995, but his guilt has not been proven.[7] However, after Kovač's term expired in March 1998 the Slovak parliament was unable to elect a successor, so Mečiar also temporarily assumed the role of acting president. As president, he issued an amnesty for some of those accused of the abduction. As a result, Slovakia under his rule became partially isolated from the West and the pace of EU and NATO accession negotiations was much slower than in the case of neighboring countries, although Mečiar supported both EU and NATO memberships for his country and submitted Slovakia's applications to both organisations.\n\nMečiar and HZDS narrowly finished first in the 1998 elections, with 27% of the votes. However, he was unable to create a coalition, and Mikuláš Dzurinda from the opposition became the new Prime Minister. Afterwards, Mečiar was one of the two leading candidates for the first direct election of the president of Slovakia in 1999, but he was defeated by Rudolf Schuster. In 2000, Mečiar's HZDS was renamed \"People's Party — Movement for a Democratic Slovakia\".\n\nIn 2000 Mečiar ostensibly gave up his political ambitions. His HZDS colleague Augustín Marián Húska said: \"The NATO-War against Yugoslavia in 1999 was also a signal to us, to not pursue any vision of political independence anymore. We have seen what will happen to forces that want to be independent.\"[8] In 2000, Mečiar was arrested by Slovak police on charges of fraud dating from his term in office.[9][10]\n\nMečiar was heavily favored to win the 2002 election, but it was thought that if he became prime minister again, it would end any chance of Slovakia getting into the EU. The 2002 elections saw the HZDS score a high percentage (20%) again. However, as in 1998, no other party was willing to serve under him. The result was another term in government for Dzurinda. The lower percentage of Mečiar's HZDS (20%) compared to the 1998 result (27%) was due to internal disputes within the organization shortly before the election, which caused many traditional HZDS members to leave the party. Some of them created the HZD (Movement for Democracy) party led by Ivan Gašparovič. In 2003, further traditional HZDS members left the party and most of them created the People's Union (Ľudová únia).\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, Mečiar tried to become Slovak president again, but was defeated in the second round by his former, long-standing ally Ivan Gašparovič. In the 2006 parliamentary election in Slovakia, HZDS had the worst election result in its history, just 8.79%. Mečiar requested an examination of the election results.[11] While HZDS became part of Robert Fico's coalition, Mečiar was not a Cabinet member. He declined to participate in the 2009 presidential election but also denied considering political retirement.\n\nIn the 2010 parliamentary election, Mečiar's HZDS dropped to 4%, leaving it out of parliament for the first time in its history. In the 2012 elections, the HZDS saw its vote collapse to 0.93%, leaving it again outside of parliament. Eventually, the party was dissolved in 2014.\n\nHis wife Margita is a medical doctor, and they have three children.Vladimir Mečiar | Slovak Prime Minister & Political Leader | Britannica: Vladimir Mečiar (born July 26, 1942, Zvolen, Czechoslovakia [now Slovakia]) is a former prime minister of Slovakia (1990–91, 1992–94, and 1994–98) who worked to establish it as a republic separate from the Czech Republic, its partner in the federation of Czechoslovakia, in 1993. His leadership was later associated with autocratic policies and failing economic conditions.\n\nIn his youth, Mečiar competed as an amateur boxer. He was educated at Comenius University in Bratislava. He served in various posts in the pro-communist Union of Slovak Youth and apparently backed Alexander Dubček during the Prague Spring of 1968. His opposition to Communist Party hard-liners cost him his party membership in 1969, and he slipped into relative obscurity for the next two decades.\n\nMečiar reemerged as a prominent member of Public Against Violence, an anticommunist opposition group, and became interim minister of the interior following the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which toppled communist rule in Czechoslovakia. In the June 1990 elections, Public Against Violence won a clear victory in Slovakia, and Mečiar became Slovak prime minister. Mečiar was ousted from his post as prime minister in April 1991, partly because of accusations of having collaborated with the secret police during the communist era. Instead of diminishing his power, however, Mečiar’s reversal boosted his popularity among Slovaks, who viewed their former premier as a martyr.\n\nOut of office but riding a crest of popular acclaim, Mečiar then formed the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (Hnutie Za Democratické Slovensko; HZDS). Seeing Slovak nationalism as his path to power, he pledged to stand up to Prague and its fast-paced program of free-market reforms. The HZDS finished first in the June 1992 regional parliamentary elections, and Mečiar again became the Slovak prime minister. He immediately entered into negotiations with the Czech prime minister, Václav Klaus, over Slovakia’s role in the Czechoslovak federation. Bound by his campaign pledge to uphold Slovak autonomy, Mečiar agreed with Klaus that the federation should be dissolved, and on Jan. 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia split into two independent republics, Czech and Slovak, respectively. Mečiar was now head of government in a sovereign country.\n\nIn his first year as leader of independent Slovakia, Mečiar faced a host of difficulties. A large Hungarian minority turned restive. Some observers saw autocratic tendencies in the HZDS regime. More seriously, the economy stumbled as Mečiar’s plan for a gentle transition from socialism to capitalism did little to reduce the nation’s dependence on the weakening arms industry. By midyear, unemployment had reached 11.5 percent and was rising, and foreign investment was dropping precipitously. The HZDS government adopted an austerity budget with reduced spending for social programs. Not surprisingly, Mečiar’s popularity plummeted, and he was defeated in a parliamentary nonconfidence vote in March 1994. Nevertheless, he returned to power for his third term as prime minister after elections that fall.\n\nMečiar’s very name became associated with corruption and economic stagnation. Western countries viewed his leadership as undemocratic, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union were wary of dealing with Slovakia because of his influence. In the elections of 1998—as Slovakia endured a 22 percent unemployment rate—Mečiar was again voted out of office when Mikulas Dzurinda won a majority. In 2000 Mečiar was arrested for having ordered the 1995 kidnapping of the son of the president of Slovakia and after allegations that he had bribed cabinet members. This news came in the wake of his 1998 decision to give amnesty to the man who had previously been charged with the kidnapping. Dzurinda tried to abolish that amnesty shortly after taking office, but in 2008 the European Court of Human Rights declared Dzurinda’s action illegal.\n\nDespite vowing in 1998 that he would never return to politics again, Mečiar ran unsuccessfully for office in 1999, 2002, and 2004. His connection to the 1995 kidnapping has never been proven.Villa Tugendhat - Wikipedia: Villa Tugendhat (Czech: Vila Tugendhat) is an architecturally significant building in Brno, Czech Republic. It is one of the pioneering prototypes of modern architecture in Europe, and was designed by the German architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich. It was built between 1928 and 1930 for Fritz Tugendhat and his wife Greta, of the wealthy and influential Jewish Czech Tugendhat family. Of reinforced concrete,[1] the villa soon became an icon of modernism. Famous for its revolutionary use of space and industrial building materials, the building was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2001.[2]\n\nThe free-standing three-story villa is on a slope and faces the south-west. The second story (the ground floor) consists of the main living and social areas with the conservatory, the terrace, the kitchen and servants' rooms. The third story (the first floor) has the main entrance from the street with a passage to the terrace, the entrance hall, and rooms for the parents, children and the nanny with appropriate facilities. The chauffeur's flat with the garages and the terrace are accessed separately.[3]\n\nMies' design principle of \"less is more\" and emphasis on functional amenities created a fine example of early functionalist architecture, a groundbreaking new vision in building design at the time. Mies used a revolutionary iron framework, which enabled him to dispense with supporting walls and arrange the interior in order to achieve a feeling of space and light. One wall is a sliding sheet of plate glass that descends to the basement the way an automobile window does. Mies specified all the furnishings, in collaboration with interior designer Lilly Reich (two armchairs designed for the building, the Tugendhat chair and the Brno chair, are still in production).[4] There were no paintings or decorative items in the villa, but the interior was by no means austere due to the use of naturally patterned materials such as the onyx wall and rare tropical woods. The onyx wall is partially translucent and changes appearance when the evening sun is low. The architect managed to make the magnificent view from the villa an integral part of the interior.\n\nThe cost was very high due to the unusual construction method, luxurious materials, and the use of modern technology for heating and ventilation. The lower-ground level was used as a service area. An ultra-modern air-conditioning system was here and a glass façade that opens completely assisted by a mechanism built into the wall.[4] The floor area was unusually large and open compared to the average family home of the period, which, in addition to the various storage rooms, made the structure unique if not confusing to visitors not used to such minimalism.\n\nThe main living area features a dividing wall of brown-gold onyx, which Mies sourced from the Atlas Mountains in Morocco. He supervised the cutting and finishing himself.\n\nUnusually for the time, the building features air conditioning.\n\nIn the basement there are a series of dedicated service rooms, including a mechanism to retract the windows and the Mottenkammer, a dedicated moth-resistant storage room for keeping fur coats.[5]\n• View from the street after reconstruction in 2012\n• View of the left side from the street 2012\n• The onyx wall in the living room\n\nThe villa was commissioned by the German Jewish Fritz and Greta Tugendhat.[4] The construction company of Artur and Moritz Eisler began construction in the summer of 1929 and finished it in 14 months.\n\nFritz and Greta Tugendhat lived in the villa for just eight years before the Nazi's persecution of and genocide of the Jewish people forced the family to flee Czechoslovakia for their lives with their children in 1938 (including philosopher Ernst Tugendhat),[6] shortly before the country was dismembered following the Munich Agreement with the Nazis.\n\nThe family moved to Switzerland and then had to flee again to Venezuela; after the Holocaust they returned to Switzerland, but never were able to live in the villa again.\n\nThe villa was confiscated by the Gestapo in 1939 and used as an apartment and office; its interior was modified and many pieces disappeared.\n\nIn 1942 the house was rented out as offices of the Nazi Messerschmitt aeroplane works. Willy Messerschmitt had his own apartment in the villa.\n\nIn April 1945, Brno was liberated by the Red Army and a Soviet unit quartered in the villa, doing considerable damage to the building's white linoleum floor. The often reported information that the villa was also used as a stable is unlikely, as the entrance door from the garden is too small. What furniture remained in the villa was used for firewood.\n\nIn the post-war years, the building was partially repaired and used for various purposes (for example as a children's physiotherapy centre) for several decades after World War II.[6]\n\nGreta Tugendhat returned to the villa in 1967 with Dirk Lohan a senior architect from Mies's Chicago studio (and his grandson) and explained the original design to him, and a group of Czech architects set out to repair it.[7] It was inscribed on the National List of Cultural Heritage in 1969 and restored after 1980. On 26 August 1992, Václav Klaus and Vladimír Mečiar, the political leaders of Czechoslovakia, met there to sign the document that divided the country into the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic.[6][8] Since 1994 the villa has been open to the public as a museum administered by the city of Brno.\n\nIn 1993 the Villa Tugendhat Fund and Friends of Tugendhat were formed to preserve the villa. In 1995 Brno received a $15,000 grant to pay for preliminary research from the Samuel H. Kress European Preservation Program, part of the World Monuments Fund. The International Music and Art Foundation, based in Liechtenstein, pledged $100,000, because a trustee, Nicholas Thaw, was also a trustee of the World Monuments Fund. The Robert Wilson Foundation matched the $100,000.[7]\n\nIn 2007 Daniela Hammer-Tugendhat applied for the restitution of the villa, citing a law covering works of art confiscated during the Holocaust.[9] The reason for this application appears to have been their frustration over the failure of the municipality of Brno to carry out vital restoration work due to the deterioration of the concrete used in construction.[1] Entire sections of the interior were missing. Later, parts of the original wood panelling were found at Masaryk University, a building used by the Gestapo as their Brno headquarters.[4]\n\nReconstruction and restoration started in February 2010 with estimated costs of 150 million CZK (approximately EUR 5,769,000; US$7,895,000).[10] This reconstruction finished in February 2012 and the villa was reopened to the public in March.[6] To celebrate the villa's restoration, the Royal Institute of British Architects launched 'Villa Tugendhat in Context', an exhibition in London giving a visual history and a record of the recent renovation through the testimony of three generations of photographers.[4]\n\nNear Villa Tugendhat is Greta's family home, the Art Nouveau Löw-Beer Villa (now a branch of the Museum of the Brno Region), which will present an exhibition The World of the Brno Bourgeoisie around the Löw-Beers and Tugendhat.[11]\n\nThe villa was a principal location in the 2007 film Hannibal Rising, serving as the villa of the villain, Vladis Gutas. Simon Mawer's 2009 Booker Prize-shortlisted novel, The Glass Room, is a fictional account of a house inspired by the villa.[12] A film based in part on the novel, The Affair, was shot at the villa and released in 2019.[13]VILLA TUGENDHAT - MIES VAN DER ROHE: See the interior of the villa from the garden!

He also used the pseudonym Arnošt Bellis.\n\nTěsnohlídek was born on 7 June 1882 in Čáslav, Austria-Hungary. He attended gymnasium in Hradec Králové and later started to study Czech, history and French at university in Prague but didn't graduate.[1]\n\nStarting in 1908, he was a contributor to the Brno newspaper Lidové noviny, where he became a reporter of soudničky (cases from the local magistrate's court).[1] His serialized novel Liška Bystrouška (Vixen Sharp Ears), written to accompany a series of drawings by Stanislav Lolek, appeared in the Lidové noviny between 7 April and 23 June 1920 [2] and is regarded as an early comic strip. The story was published as a book in 1921, won a state prize and achieved lasting popularity. This optimistic tale, somewhere between a children's fairy tale and adult satire, was used as the basis for Leoš Janáček's opera The Cunning Little Vixen (Příhody Lišky Bystroušky, 1923).\n\nSome of Těsnohlídek's other work reflects more pessimism and alienation than the lighthearted Vixen's tale.\n\nHis life, as interpreted by his journalistic colleague Bedřich Golombek, was a melodramatic tragedy imbued with pessimism, darkness, melancholy and decadence, a life plagued from childhood by feelings of sadness and social exclusion. In his teens, he watched helplessly as a friend drowned. When he was 21, he married Jindra Kopecká, a woman with tuberculosis. Two months after their wedding, on a holiday in Norway, she shot herself in the heart in front of him, possibly accidentally. Těsnohlídek was accused of murdering her, and had to endure two trials before being acquitted. In 1907 he moved to Brno.\n\nIn November 1909, he married for the second time with Anna Kutilová and they had a son Milan, the only child of Těsnohlídek. He moved to Bílovice nad Svitavou, where his wife came from, and lived here eight years in 1914–1922.[3][4] In Bílovice nad Svitavou he wrote Liška Bystrouška and considered the period spent there to be the happiest and most fruitful in his life.[5]\n\nTwo day before Christmas 1919, Těsnohlídek and some friends were walking in the woods outside Bílovice nad Svitavou when they discovered an abandoned girl, aged seventeen months, in danger of freezing. They rescued the child and took her to the police station.[3][1]\n\nHe married a third time. He became interested in exploring the Moravian caves, wrote extensively about them, and submitted his drafts for publication but found they had been heavily edited without his knowledge. On 12 January 1928 in Brno, he shot himself, as his first wife had done. His third wife gassed herself to death on hearing the news.\n\nUrsula Dubosarsky's 2018 novel for children, Brindabella, is based on Vixen Sharp Ears relocated in the Australian bush, with the role of the Vixen played by a kangaroo.[6][7]\n• Dva mezi ostatními (Two Among Others) (1906)\n• Čimčirínek a chlapci (Čimčirínek and the Boys) (1922, stories for children)\n• Surovost z něžnosti a jiné soudničky (The Brutality of Tenderness and Other soudničky) (a collection of his soudničky, published in 1982)\n\nVixen Sharp Ears was first published in English in 1985, as The Cunning Little Vixen, with pictures by Maurice Sendak.The Cunning Little Vixen (English and Czech Edition): Rudolf Těsnohlídek wrote Vixen Sharp-Ears as a comic serial for Czech newspapers in 1920. It was so popular, it became an opera, complete with its own memorial statue. In 1985, the first English translation was produced in book form, with Maurice Sendak providing the illustrations from his work in designing the 1981 New York City Opera version of the opera. Because it has Sendak’s illustrations, most readers will assume it is a children’s book. It is, in one way. But the original comic was not meant as a rosy child’s view of life, which means this can be reading for adults, too. Yes, especially adults, who can understand the harshness of Rudolf Těsnohlídek’s message. Life is brutal, a world of not-so-innocent animals, living out brief lives in brutal harmony, with another world of longer-lived humans, who are no less brutal, scarcely more intelligent, and a good deal less happy.\n\n\n\nWe first see the Cunning Little Vixen as little Sharp-Ears, a spoiled fox pup, who is too busy playing with a frog to notice the big human in the bushes. She is captured and brought to the human’s home where she becomes a toy for his children. Her new home also includes Catcher, the forester’s dog, who provides companionship and advice the little fox does not heed. In time, she ends up scratching the leg of one of the children resulting in her being tied up. To the Vixen’s great delight, it allows her an opportunity to learn about the egotistical rooster and his harem of hens. By the time the forester’s wife discovers the fox has eaten all but one hen, the Vixen makes her way back to the forest and to her freedom.\n\n\n\nThere is more to the adventure, but it’s really about the governed and those who govern and how freedom is not as easy as it appears to be. The last part of the book describes the life of Rudolf Těsnohlídek and how he quickly declined after the death of his wife. He was brought to trial twice for killing her, even though he said she shot herself as she was in the final ravages of tuberculosis. There is also the detailing of the creation of the opera and its American premiere. So, not the usual children’s book but a worthy one in any case.\n\n\n\nBook Season = Summer (sly adventures)"}

That exit may happen at the end of elementary school, middle school, high school graduation or at any other checkpoint along the way. The Kentucky statewide Portrait of Learner, approved by the Kentucky Board of Education in October 2022, identifies the skills students need to be prepared for an ever-changing world that is driven by technology, human interaction and innovation. This portrait gives school leaders and teachers the framework to design instruction in a way that promotes real-world competencies and job readiness. Kentucky's statewide PoL aligns with the three big ideas of United We Learn and will enable this vision for transforming education in the Commonwealth to come to life throughout our districts, schools and classrooms.KDE - Wikipedia: KDE is an international free software community that develops free and open-source software. As a central development hub, it provides tools and resources that enable collaborative work on its projects.[1] Its products include the Plasma Desktop, KDE Frameworks, and a range of applications such as Kate, digiKam, and Krita.[2] Many KDE applications are cross-platform and can run on Unix and Unix-like operating systems, Microsoft Windows, and Android.[3] KDE is legally represented by KDE e.V. based in Germany, who also own the KDE trademarks and fund the project.\n\nKDE was founded in 1996 by Matthias Ettrich, a student at the University of Tübingen.[4] At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the Unix desktop. Among his concerns was that none of the applications looked or behaved alike. In his opinion, desktop applications of the time were too complicated for end users. In order to solve the issue, he proposed the creation of a desktop environment in which users could expect the applications to be consistent and easy to use. His initial Usenet post spurred significant interest, and the KDE project was born.[5]\n\nThe name KDE was intended as a wordplay on the existing Common Desktop Environment, available for Unix systems.[6] CDE was an X11-based user environment jointly developed by HP, IBM, and Sun through the X/Open consortium, with an interface and productivity tools based on the Motif graphical widget toolkit. It was supposed to be an intuitively easy-to-use desktop computer environment.[7] The K was originally suggested to stand for \"Kool\", but it was quickly decided that the K should stand for nothing in particular. Therefore, the KDE initialism expanded to \"K Desktop Environment\" before it was dropped altogether in favor of simply KDE in a rebranding effort in 2009.[8]\n\nIn the beginning Matthias Ettrich chose to use Trolltech's Qt framework for the KDE project.[9] Other programmers quickly started developing KDE/Qt applications, and by early 1997, a few applications were being released. On 12 July 1998 the first version of the desktop environment, called KDE 1.0, was released. The original GPL licensed version of this toolkit only existed for platforms that used the X11 display server, but with the release of Qt 4, LGPL licensed versions are available for more platforms. This allowed KDE software based on Qt 4 or newer versions to theoretically be distributed to Microsoft Windows and OS X.[10]\n\nThe KDE Marketing Team announced a rebranding of the KDE project components on 24 November 2009. Motivated by the perceived shift in objectives, the rebranding focused on emphasizing both the community of software creators and the various tools supplied by the KDE, rather than just the desktop environment.\n\nWhat was previously known as KDE 4 was split into KDE Plasma Workspaces, KDE Applications, and KDE Platform (now KDE Frameworks) bundled as KDE Software Compilation 4.[11] Since 2009, the name KDE no longer stands for K Desktop Environment, but for the community that produces the software.[12]\n\nThe KDE community maintains multiple free-software projects. The project formerly referred to as KDE (or KDE SC (Software Compilation)) nowadays consists of three parts:\n• KDE Plasma, a graphical desktop environment with customizable layouts and panels, supporting virtual desktops and widgets. Written with Qt and KDE Frameworks.\n• KDE Frameworks, a collection of libraries and software frameworks built on top of Qt (formerly known as 'kdelibs' or 'KDE Platform'). 14\n• KDE Gear, utility applications (like Kdenlive or Krita) mostly built on KDE Frameworks and which are often part of the official KDE Applications release.\n\nKDE neon is a software repository that uses Ubuntu LTS as a core. It aims to provide the users with rapidly updated Qt and KDE software, while updating the rest of the OS components from the Ubuntu repositories at the normal pace.[15][16] KDE maintains that it is not a \"KDE distribution\", but rather an up-to-date archive of KDE and Qt packages.\n\nSubtitle Composer is an open-source subtitle editor for the Linux and Microsoft Windows operating systems, based on Qt and KDE Frameworks. The project became part of KDE starting in December 2019.[17] It supports the most common text and bitmap-based subtitle formats, video previewing, audio waveform, speech recognition, timings synchronization, subtitle translation, OCR and Javascript macros/scripting. Subtitle Composer is free software released under the GNU General Public License.\n\nWikiToLearn, abbreviated WTL, is one of KDE's newer endeavors. It is a wiki (based on MediaWiki, like Wikipedia) that provides a platform to create and share open source textbooks. The idea is to have a massive library of textbooks for anyone and everyone to use and create. Its roots lie in the University of Milan, where a group of physics majors wanted to share notes and then decided that it was for everyone and not just their internal group of friends. They have become an official KDE project with several universities backing it.\n\nDeveloping KDE software is primarily a volunteer effort, although various companies, such as Novell, Nokia,[18][failed verification] or Blue Systems employ or employed developers to work on various parts of the project.[19] Since a large number of individuals contribute to KDE in various ways (e.g. code, translation, artwork), organization of such a project is complex. A mentor program helps beginners to get started with developing and communicating within KDE projects and communities.[20][21]\n\nCommunication within the community takes place via mailing lists, IRC, blogs, forums, news announcements, wikis and conferences. The community has a Code of Conduct for acceptable behavior within the community.[22]\n\nCurrently the KDE community uses the Git version control system. The KDE GitLab Instance (named Invent) gives an overview of all projects hosted by KDE's Git repository system. Phabricator is used for task management.[23]\n\nOn 20 July 2009, KDE announced that the one millionth commit has been made to its Subversion repository.[24] On 11 October 2009, Cornelius Schumacher, a main developer within KDE,[25] wrote about the estimated cost (using the COCOMO model with SLOCCount) to develop KDE software package with 4,273,291 LoC, which would be about US$175,364,716.[26] This estimation does not include Qt, Calligra Suite, Amarok, digiKam, and other applications that are not part of KDE core.[clarification needed]\n\nThe overall direction is set by the KDE Core Team. These are developers who have made significant contributions within KDE over a long period of time. This team communicates using the kde-core-devel mailing list, which is publicly archived and readable, but joining requires approval. KDE does not have a single central leader who can veto important decisions. Instead, the KDE core team consists of several dozens of contributors who make decisions not by a formal vote, but through discussions.[27]\n\nThe developers also organize alongside topical teams.[clarification needed] For example, the KDE Edu team develops free educational software. While these teams work mostly independent and do not all follow a common release schedule. Each team has its own messaging channels, both on IRC and on the mailing lists.[28]\n\nA KDE Patron is an individual or organization supporting the KDE community by donating at least 5000 Euro (depending on the company's size) to the KDE e.V.[29] As of February 2024, there are nine such patrons: Blue Systems, Canonical Ltd., Google, GnuPG, Kubuntu Focus, Slimbook, SUSE, The Qt Company, and TUXEDO Computers.[30]\n\nThe KDE community's mascot is a green dragon named Konqi.[31] Konqi's appearance was officially redesigned with the coming of Plasma 5, with Tyson Tan's entry (seen in the images) winning the redesign competition on the KDE Forums.[32]\n\nKatie is a female dragon. She was presented in 2010 and is appointed as a mascot for the KDE women's community.[33]\n\nOther dragons with different colors and professions were added to Konqi as part of the Tyson Tan redesign concept. Each dragon has a pair of letter-shaped antlers that reflect their role in the KDE community.\n\nKandalf the wizard was the former mascot for the KDE community during its 1.x and 2.x versions. Kandalf's similarity to the character of Gandalf led to speculation that the mascot was switched to Konqi due to copyright infringement concerns, but this has never been confirmed by KDE.[34]\n\nThe financial and legal matters of KDE are handled by KDE e.V., a German non-profit organization. Among others, it owns the KDE trademark and the corresponding logo. It also accepts donations on behalf of the KDE community, helps to run the servers, assists in organizing and financing conferences and meetings,[35] but does not influence software development directly.\n\nIn many countries, KDE has local branches. These are either informal organizations (KDE India) or like the KDE e.V., given a legal form (KDE France). The local organizations host and maintain regional websites, and organize local events, such as tradeshows, contributor meetings and social community meetings.\n\nKDE has community identity guidelines (CIG) for definitions and recommendations which help the community to establish a unique, characteristic, and appealing design.[36] The KDE official logo displays the white trademarked K-Gear shape on a blue square with mitred corners. Copying of the KDE Logo is subject to the LGPL.[37] Some local community logos are derivations of the official logo.\n\nMany KDE applications have a K in the name, mostly as an initial letter. The K in many KDE applications is obtained by spelling a word which originally begins with C or Q differently, for example Konsole and Kaffeine, while some others prefix a commonly used word with a K, for instance KGet. However, the trend is not to have a K in the name at all, such as with Stage, Spectacle, Discover and Dolphin.\n\nOn 23 June 2005, chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation announced that the KDE community and the Wikimedia Foundation have begun efforts towards cooperation.[38] Fruits of that cooperation are MediaWiki syntax highlighting in Kate and accessing Wikipedia content within KDE applications, such as Amarok and Marble.\n\nOn 4 April 2008, the KDE e.V. and Wikimedia Deutschland opened shared offices in Frankfurt.[39]\n\nIn May 2006, KDE e.V. became an Associate Member of the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE).[40]\n\nOn 22 August 2008, KDE e.V. and FSFE jointly announced that after working with FSFE's Freedom Task Force for one and a half years KDE adopts FSFE's Fiduciary Licence Agreement. Using that, KDE developers can – on a voluntary basis – assign their copyrights to KDE e.V.[41]\n\nIn September 2009, KDE e.V. and FSFE moved into shared offices in Berlin.[42]\n\nSeveral companies actively contribute to KDE, like Collabora, Erfrakon, Intevation GmbH, Kolab Konsortium, Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB (KDAB), Blue Systems, and KO GmbH.\n\nNokia used Calligra Suite as base for their Office Viewer application for Maemo/MeeGo.[43] They have also been contracting KO GmbH to bring MS Office 2007 file format filters to Calligra.[44] Nokia also employed several KDE developers directly – either to use KDE software for MeeGo (e.g. KCal)[45] or as sponsorship.\n\nThe software development and consulting companies Intevation GmbH of Germany and the Swedish KDAB use Qt and KDE software – especially Kontact and Akonadi for Kolab – for their services and products, therefore both employ KDE developers.\n\nKDE participates in freedesktop.org, an effort to standardize Unix desktop interoperability.\n\nIn 2009 and 2011, GNOME and KDE co-hosted their conferences Akademy and GUADEC under the Desktop Summit label.\n\nIn December 2010 KDE e.V. became a licensee of the Open Invention Network.[46]\n\nMany Linux distributions and other free operating systems are involved in the development and distribution of the software, and are therefore also active in the KDE community. These include commercial distributors such as SUSE/Novell[47] or Red Hat[48] but also government-funded non-commercial organizations such as the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey with its Linux distribution Pardus.\n\nIn October 2018, Red Hat declared that KDE Plasma was no longer supported in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, though it continues to be part of Fedora. The announcement came shortly after the announcement of the business acquisition of Red Hat by IBM for close to US$43 billion.[49] As a result, Fedora now makes KDE Plasma and other KDE software available also to Red Hat Enterprise Linux users through their Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) project.[50][51]\n\nThe two most important conferences of KDE are Akademy and Camp KDE. Each event is on a large scale, both thematically and geographically. Akademy-BR and Akademy-es are local community events.\n\nAkademy is the annual world summit, held each summer at varying venues in Europe.[52] The primary goals of Akademy are to act as a community building event, to communicate the achievements of community, and to provide a platform for collaboration with community and industry partners. Secondary goals are to engage local people, and to provide space for getting together to write code. KDE e.V. assist with procedures, advice and organization. Akademy including conference, KDE e.V. general assembly, marathon coding sessions, BOFs (birds of a feather sessions) and social program. BOFs meet to discuss specific sub-projects or issues.[53]\n\nThe first conference that the KDE community held was KDE One, in Arnsberg, Germany, in 1997 to discuss the first KDE release. Initially, each conference was numbered after the release, and not regular held. Since 2003 the conferences were held once a year. And they were named Akademy since 2004.\n\nThe yearly Akademy conference gives Akademy Awards, are awards that the KDE community gives to KDE contributors. Their purpose is to recognize outstanding contribution to KDE. There are three awards, best application, best non-application and jury's award. As always the winners are chosen by the winners from the previous year.[54] First winners received a framed picture of Konqi signed by all attending KDE developers.[55]\n\nCamp KDE is another annual contributor's conference of the KDE community. The event provides a regional opportunity for contributors and enthusiasts to gather and share their experiences. It is free to all participants. It is intended to ensure that KDE in the world is not simply seen as being Euro-centric. The KDE e.V. helps travel and accommodation subsidies for presenters, BoF leaders, organizers or core contributor. It is held in the North America since 2009.\n\nIn January 2008, KDE 4.0 Release Event was held at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, US, to celebrate the release of KDE SC 4.0. The community realized that there was a strong demand for KDE events in the Americas, therefore Camp KDE was produced.\n\nCamp KDE 2009 was the premiere meeting of the KDE Americas, was held at the Travellers Beach Resort in Negril, Jamaica, sponsored by Google, Intel, iXsystem, KDE e.V. and Kitware. The event included 1–2 days of presentations, BoF meetings and hackathon sessions.[56] Camp KDE 2010 took place at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in La Jolla, US. The schedule included presentations, BoFs, hackathons and a day trip. It started with a short introduction by Jeff Mitchell, who was the principal organizer of the conference, talked a bit of history about Camp KDE and some statistics about the KDE community. With around 70 participants, the talks of the event were relatively well attended. On 1/19, the social event was a tour of a local brewery.[57] Camp KDE 2011 was held at Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco, US. It was co-located with the Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit. The schedule included presentations, hackathons and a party at Noisebridge. The conference opened with an introduction by Celeste Lyn Paul.[58]\n\nSeason of KDE is an outreach program hosted by the KDE community. Students are appointed mentors from the KDE community that help bring their project to fruition.[59]\n\nconf.kde.in was the first KDE and Qt conference in India. The conference, organized by KDE India, was held at R.V. College of Engineering in Bangalore, India. The first three days of the event had talks, tutorials, and interactive sessions. The last two days were a focused code sprint.[60] The conference was opened by its main organizer, Pradeepto Bhattacharya. Over 300 people were at the opening talks. The Lighting of the Auspicious Lamp ceremony was performed to open the conference. The first session was by Lydia Pintscher, who spoke on \"So much to do – so little time\". At the event, the return of Project Neon was announced on March 11, 2011, with the project providing nightly builds of the KDE Software Compilation.[61] Closing the conference was keynote speaker and old-time KDE developer Sirtaj.\n\nDía KDE (KDE Day) is an Argentinian event focused on KDE. It gives talks and workshops. The purposes of the event are to: spread the free software movement among the population of Argentina, bringing to it the KDE community and environment developed by it; know and strengthen KDE-AR; and generally bring the community together to have fun. The event is free.[62]\n\nA Release party is a party, which celebrates the release of a new version of the KDE SC (twice a year).[63] KDE also participates in other conferences that revolve around free software.\n\nBrazil's primary school education system operates computers running KDE software, with more than 42,000 schools in 4,000 cities, thus serving nearly 52 million children. The base distribution is called Educational Linux, which is based on Kubuntu.[64] Besides this, thousands more students in Brazil use KDE products in their universities. KDE software is also running on computers in Portuguese and Venezuelan schools, with respectively 700,000 and one million systems reached.[65]\n\nThrough Pardus, a local Linux distribution, many sections of the Turkish government make use of KDE software, including the Turkish Armed Forces,[66] Ministry of Foreign Affairs,[66] Ministry of National Defence,[67] Turkish Police,[66] and the SGK (Social Security Institution of Turkey),[66][68] although these departments often do not exclusively use Pardus as their operating system.\n\nGermany uses KDE software in its embassies around the world, representing around 11,000 systems. [citation needed]\n\nNASA used the Plasma Desktop during the Mars Mission.[70][non-primary source needed]\n\nValve Corporation's handheld gaming computer, the Steam Deck, uses the KDE Plasma desktop environment when in desktop mode.[71]KDE Applications: KDE is a community of friendly people who create over 200 apps which run on any Linux desktop, and often other platforms too. Here is the complete list.\n\nFilter by name and descriptionKDE neon: More than ever, people expect cutting-edge features delivered right from their developers, with no modifications or gatekeeping. KDE neon delivers this by packaging the hottest software fresh from the KDE Community ovens, the moment it’s released.\n\nYou should use KDE neon if you are an adventurous KDE enthusiast who wants the latest and greatest from the KDE community as soon as it’s available, with no delays, opinionated patches, or UX changes. This is KDE software the way KDE designed it!"}

Nacisté reagovali na jeho smrt brutálními represáliemi, které si vyžádaly životy stovek lidí, včetně mnoha civilistů.

took part in assassinating Reinhard Heydrich\n\nJozef Gabčík (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈjɔzev ˈɡaptʂiːk]; 8 April 1912 – 18 June 1942) was a Slovak soldier in the Czechoslovak Army involved in the Operation Anthropoid, the assassination of acting Reichsprotektor (Realm-Protector) of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, SS Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich.\n\nGabčík was born 1912 in Poluvsie, part of town Rajecfürdő (now Rajecké Teplice), Trencsén County, Kingdom of Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary, now in northwestern Slovakia). He learned to be a farrier, as well as a blacksmith. He was also taught clock making at the village of Kostelec nad Vltavou (in central Bohemia). He was taught by local master blacksmith J. Kunike. He lived with the Kunike family in their house of which still stands together with the outbuilding and yard which was used as a smithy. In 1927 the school records show that he attended school in business studies at village Kovářov near to Kostelec nad Vltavou. The building which housed the school is today the municipal office. (A marble plaque was erected in 2010, together with historical documents on the wall there – these documents were all placed there by the citizens of Kovářov.)[citation needed]\n\nIn 1937, he began work at a military chemical plant in Žilina; after an accident, however, he was transferred to the gas storage facility (which belonged to the Czechoslovak army) in Trenčín.[citation needed]\n\nThe breakup of the Czechoslovak Republic and the subsequent emergence (on 14 March 1939) of the clero-fascist and anti-Czech Slovak State he did not accept – when German Wehrmacht took over the military depot he sabotaged it. To escape punishment, he fled to Poland (on 6 June 1939) and joined forming Czechoslovak military unit in Polish service (Czechoslovak Legion). Then, with other comrades, was transferred via ship to France and there entered the 1st Regiment of the Foreign Legion. In 26 September 1939 he was drafted in Agde into the emerging Czechoslovak foreign army in France and included as deputy commander of the machine gun platoon at the 1st Infantry Regiment of the 1st Czechoslovak Infantry Division in France (1re division d'infanterie tchécoslovaque en France). Three months later, he was promoted to the rank of četař (sergeant) and participated in the Battle of France during the spring of 1940.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing France's surrender, together with remnants of Czechoslovak troops, he evacuated (12 July 1940) to Great Britain where he was trained as a paratrooper. He became a rotmistr (approx. UK staff sergeant) in rank. The Free Czechoslovaks, as he and other self-exiled Czechoslovaks were called, were stationed at Cholmondeley Castle near Malpas in Cheshire.[1]\n\nJozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš were airlifted along with seven soldiers from Czechoslovak army-in-exile in the United Kingdom and two other groups named Silver A and Silver B (who had different missions) by a Royal Air Force Halifax of No. 138 Squadron into Czechoslovakia at 10 pm on 28 December 1941. In Prague, they contacted several families and anti-Nazi organisations who helped them during the preparations for the assassination.[2]\n\nOn 27 May 1942, at 10:30 am, Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home in Panenské Břežany to Prague Castle. Gabčík and Kubiš waited at the tram stop on the curve near Bulovka Hospital in Prague 8-Libeň. As Heydrich's open-topped Mercedes-Benz arrived, Gabčík, who concealed his Sten gun under a raincoat, dropped the raincoat and raised the gun to shoot Heydrich, but the gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-Oberscharführer Klein, to stop the car. As the car braked in front of him, Kubiš threw a modified anti-tank grenade[3] (concealed in a briefcase) at the vehicle; it detonated under the car, seriously wounding Heydrich, its fragments ripping through the right rear fender and embedding shrapnel from the upholstery of the car into Heydrich, causing serious injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen and lung, as well as a fractured rib. Kubiš received a minor wound to his face from the shrapnel. Heydrich and Klein leapt out of the shattered car with drawn pistols; Klein ran towards Kubiš, who had staggered against the railings, while Heydrich went to Gabčík who stood, holding the sten. Kubiš recovered and, jumped on his bicycle and pedalled away, scattering passengers spilling from the tram, by firing in the air with his Colt M1903 pistol. Klein tried to fire at him but dazed by the explosion, pressed the magazine release catch and the gun jammed.[6] A staggering Heydrich came towards Gabčík, who dropped his sten and tried to reach his bicycle. He was forced to abandon this attempt, however, and took cover behind a telegraph pole, firing at Heydrich with his pistol. Heydrich returned fire and ducked behind the stalled tram, when he suddenly doubled over and staggered to the side of the road in pain. He then collapsed against the railings, holding himself up with one hand. As Gabčík took the opportunity to run, Klein rushed to help his wounded superior. Heydrich, his face pale and contorted in pain, pointed toward the fleeing Gabčík, saying \"Get that bastard!\". As Klein gave pursuit, Heydrich stumbled along the pavement before collapsing against the bonnet of his car. Gabčík fled into a butcher shop, where the owner, a man named Brauer, who was a Nazi sympathiser and had a brother who worked for the Gestapo, ignored Gabčík's request for help, and ran out into the roadway, attracting Klein's attention by shouting and pointing. Klein, whose gun was still jammed, ran into the shop and collided with Gabčík in the doorway. In the confusion, Gabčík shot him twice, severely wounding him in the leg. Gabčík then escaped in a tram, reaching a local safe house.[10][11] The assassins were initially convinced that the attack had failed. Heydrich was rushed to Bulovka Hospital, where he consequently developed a fatal case of blood poisoning. He died of his injuries on June 4, 1942. [12]\n\nA rigorous investigation of the assassination determined that it was planned and executed by the Czech Resistance with the assistance of the British. The oppression and persecution of the defiant Czechs reached its peak following the failure of Nazi soldiers to capture the assassins alive. More than 13,000 people were ultimately arrested and tortured, including the girlfriend of Jan Kubiš, Anna Malinová, who died at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. First Lieutenant Adolf Opálka's aunt, Marie Opálková, was executed in Mauthausen on 24 October 1942.[13] His father, Viktor Jarolím, was also killed.[14] Among the unfortunate was Kostelec nad Vltavou native JUDr. Jan Fleischmann. It was known locally that Gabčík visited Fleischmann, who was a friend in Kostelec and Vltavou, before the assassination of Heydrich. After the assassination, this visit was discovered due to Karel Čurda informing the Gestapo.[citation needed] The Nazis arrested Fleischmann and took him to Pankrác where he was tortured and finally executed.[citation needed]\n\nThe Nazi officials in the Protectorate carried out an extensive search for the two men. Eventually, the Germans found them, along with other paratroopers, hiding in Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague. After a six-hour gun battle, in which the Germans lost 14 and sustained wounds to 21 others, Gabčík and the others, with the exception of Kubiš, who was seriously wounded by a grenade, committed suicide before the Nazis could take them alive in the church catacombs.[15] Kubiš died of his wounds shortly after arrival at the hospital.[16]\n\nThe town of Gabčíkovo in southern Slovakia is named after Gabčík, and one of the biggest dams on the Danube next to the village is named after the town. Jozef Gabčík's name was also given to the 5. pluk špeciálneho určenia (\"5th special operations regiment of Jozef Gabčík\") part of the Slovak Armed Forces, based in Žilina.[citation needed]\n\nIn May 2007, with the aim of commemorating the heroes of the Czech and Slovak Resistance, the Slovak National Museum opened an exhibition presenting one of the most important resistance actions in the whole Nazi-occupied Europe.[17]\n\nCoinciding with the release of the film Anthropoid (2016), campaigners called for Gabčík's and Kubiš's bodies to be exhumed from the mass grave at the Ďáblice Cemetery in northern Prague, and to be given a dignified burial fitting \"the heroes of anti-Nazi resistance\".[18]\n\nA memorial stone for Gabčík and Kubiš can be found in the grounds of St John the Baptist Church in Ightfield (ref W9VR+FJ Whitchurch on Google Maps).\n• Jack Reynor (2017) The Man with the Iron Heart\n\nGabčík is a character in the historical novel \"HHhH\" by Laurent Binet (2009/English translation 2012).Czechs search for dead 'heroes' who killed SS chief Heydrich: The assassination of Nazi police chief Reinhard Heydrich by Czechoslovak resistance fighters in 1942 was one of the outstanding feats of daring in World War Two. A new thriller called Anthropoid premieres in the US on 12 August, dramatising the ambush by British-trained Czechoslovak paratroopers Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis in Prague. Yet even today parts of the story are shrouded in mystery. SS Obergruppenfuehrer Heydrich, acting Reichsprotektor of occupied Bohemia and Moravia, was a key organiser of the Holocaust. The Nazi retaliation for his assassination was savage - the Czech villages of Lidice and Lezaky were razed, the inhabitants shot or deported to concentration camps.\n\nI have had some jarring reminders of the assassination - Operation Anthropoid - during my time in Prague. I know now my second flat was a five-minute walk from the spot where, on 27 May 1942, Heydrich's open-top Mercedes slowed to negotiate a hairpin bend. It was less than 700m (2,310ft) from where Jozef Gabcik's Sten sub-machine gun jammed and where Jan Kubis threw his bomb.\n\nHouses in the district where I now live are dotted with plaques to those who helped shelter the parachutists and who paid the ultimate price. The SS military hospital on the river, where Kubis was brought, badly wounded, is now the maternity hospital where both of my children were born. Kubis was dragged there from the church crypt where seven Czechoslovaks had held off 800 SS and Gestapo troops. He never regained consciousness. Gabcik took his own life. The parachutists were laid out in front of the church to be identified by the man who had betrayed them, fellow paratrooper Karel Curda.\n\nSurprisingly, the truth has begun to emerge only in the past decade. \"Under these trees are mass graves of people from the Second World War. You can even see where they are - look - the earth has been compressed a little,\" said Jiri Linek, from the Organisation of Former Political Prisoners. We had walked down a path to a small clearing in Dablice cemetery, on the northern fringes of Prague. I had driven past it, unwittingly, for years. \"Here,\" said Jiri, pointing at a patch of grass, the rectangular outlines of a slight depression faintly visible. \"Or maybe here. This is where they should be.\"\n\nHistorians and researchers agree the mass graves of this local cemetery are the final resting place not just for Gabcik and Kubis, but their five fellow parachutists, the dozens of citizens who sheltered them, and the hundreds shot in reprisal for Heydrich's death. But while every Czech schoolchild has heard of Gabcik and Kubis, hardly anyone realises they are buried here. \"People simply don't know. It was hidden for 42 years,\" Mr Linek told the BBC. \"If the Communist regime hadn't started in 1948, we would know exactly where Gabcik, Kubis and the others were. But because they flew from England, a capitalist state and our enemy, they weren't regarded as the heroes they should have been.\"\n\nThe location has been established almost single-handedly by author Jaroslav Cvancara. He was fascinated by the Operation Anthropoid story from childhood. In the 1980s he began travelling the country, tracking down the parachutists' relatives, borrowing their memories and photographs. During that time he befriended a former Czechoslovak police officer who had been assigned to Prague's Institute of Forensic Medicine during the war. That was where Kubis, Gabcik and the five others were brought for autopsy. The policeman was on good terms with the Czech pathologists working at the institute, which was divided into Czech and German parts. \"One night, the German pathologists were celebrating something or other, and so this policeman with two colleagues crept into the main autopsy room, where they knew the skulls of the parachutists were kept,\" Mr Cvancara told the BBC. \"They took photos of the skulls - the only photos in existence,\" he said, adding that he later asked an anthropologist to compare them with pre-war images of the men to confirm they matched. \"These were the skulls of the five other parachutists. Gabcik and Kubis were also there; their severed heads had been kept in jars, preserved in formaldehyde,\" he said. \"Unfortunately they didn't manage to take photos of them.\" The policeman also introduced Mr Cvancara to one of the Czech pathologists who had been working at the institute in 1942. He confirmed the headless bodies were almost certainly taken to Dablice.\n\nA campaign is now under way to get the Czech authorities to exhume the mass graves at Dablice, which contain the remains of an estimated 8,000 people. They range from World War Two resistance heroes, Gestapo officers shot in 1945 and infants born to Communist-era political prisoners in the 1950s. Jiri Linek, however, says that by cross-referencing the autopsy dates with World-War-Two-era aerial photos of Dablice, the search for the parachutists' bodies could be narrowed down significantly. \"We need to treat them better than waste. These people were basically dumped into that grave as human waste,\" said Neela Winkelmann, managing director of the Prague-based Platform of European Memory and Conscience, which is spearheading the campaign. \"Of course it requires opening - literally getting the skeletons out of the cupboard, and opening some painful topics. But we cannot avoid this. \"If we want to proceed towards a more evolved nation, we have to honestly deal with the past. And give this last service to our dead.\" The film Anthropoid will be released in the UK on 9 September.Jan Kubiš - Wikipedia: Jan Kubiš (24 June 1913 – 18 June 1942) was a Czech soldier, one of a team of Czechoslovak British-trained paratroopers sent to eliminate acting Reichsprotektor (Realm-Protector) of Bohemia and Moravia, SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, in 1942 as part of Operation Anthropoid.[1] During the assassination attempt, Kubiš threw a makeshift grenade that mortally wounded Heydrich.\n\nJan Kubiš was born in 1913 in Dolní Vilémovice, Moravia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (present-day Czech Republic). Jan was a Boy Scout.[3][4]\n\nJan Kubiš, having previously been an active member of Orel, started his military career as a Czechoslovak army conscript on 1 November 1935 by 31st Infantry Regiment \"Arco\" in Jihlava. After passing petty officer course and promotion to corporal, Kubiš served some time in Znojmo before being transferred to 34th infantry regiment \"Marksman Jan Čapek\" in Opava, where he served at guard battalion stationed in Jakartovice. Here, Kubiš reached promotion to platoon sergeant.\n\nDuring the Czechoslovak mobilisation of 1938, Kubiš served as deputy commander of a platoon in Czechoslovak border fortifications in the Opava area. Following the Munich Agreement and demobilisation, Kubiš was discharged from army on 19 October 1938 and returned to his civilian life, working at a brick factory.\n\nAt the eve of World War II, on 16 June 1939, Kubiš fled Czechoslovakia and joined a forming Czechoslovak unit in Kraków, Poland. Soon he was transferred to Algiers, where he entered the French Foreign Legion. He fought in France during the early stage of World War II and received his Croix de Guerre there.\n\nA month after the German victory in the Battle of France, Kubiš fled to Great Britain, where he received training as a paratrooper. The Free Czechoslovaks, as he and other self-exiled Czechoslovaks were called, were stationed at Cholmondeley Castle near Malpas in Cheshire. He and his best friend, Jozef Gabčík, both befriended the Ellison family, from Ightfield, Shropshire, whom they met while in Whitchurch, Shropshire.\n\nIn 1941, Kubiš was dropped into Czechoslovakia as part of Operation Anthropoid, where he died following the successful assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. His remains were buried secretly in a mass grave at the Ďáblice cemetery in Prague. Since this was unknown after World War II, Karel Čurda, the member of their squad who betrayed them to the Nazis, was coincidentally also buried at the cemetery. However, in 1990 mass graves were excavated and a memorial site with symbolic gravestones was established instead.[5] In 2009, a memorial was built at the place of the attack on Heydrich.\n\nJozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš were airlifted along with seven soldiers from Czechoslovakia's army-in-exile in the United Kingdom and two other groups named Silver A and Silver B (who had different missions) by a Royal Air Force Halifax of No. 138 Squadron into Czechoslovakia at 10 pm on 28 December 1941. In Prague, they contacted several families and anti-Nazi organisations who helped them during the preparations for the assassination.\n\nOn 27 May 1942, Heydrich had planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer Heydrich to German occupied France, where the French resistance was gaining ground. Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merged with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction, in the Prague suburb of Libeň, was well-suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. At 10:30 am, Heydrich proceeded on his daily commute from his home in Panenské Břežany to Prague Castle. Gabčík and Kubiš waited at the tram stop on the curve near Bulovka Hospital in Prague 8-Libeň. As Heydrich's open-topped Mercedes-Benz arrived, Gabčík tried to shoot Heydrich, but his Sten gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-Oberscharführer Klein, to stop the car. As the car braked in front of him, Kubiš threw a modified anti-tank grenade[8] (concealed in a briefcase) at the vehicle; he misjudged his throw. Instead of landing inside the car, it landed against the rear wheel. Nonetheless, the bomb severely wounded Heydrich when it detonated, its fragments ripping through the right rear fender and embedding shrapnel from the upholstery of the car into Heydrich, causing serious injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen and lung, as well as a fractured rib. Kubiš received a minor wound to his face from the shrapnel. As Kubiš staggered against the railings, Klein leapt out of the shattered limousine with a drawn pistol; Kubiš recovered and jumped on his bicycle and pedaled away, scattering passengers spilling from the tram, by firing in the air with his Colt M1903 pistol. Klein tried to shoot at him but dazed by the explosion, pressed the magazine release catch and the gun jammed.[11] Heydrich died of his injuries on 4 June.\n\nKubiš and his group were found on 18 June in the Church of St Cyril and St Methodius in Resslova Street in Prague. In a bloody battle that lasted for six hours, Kubiš was seriously wounded by a grenade and was found unconscious. He died of his wounds shortly after arrival at the hospital. Heinz Pannwitz, the German detective charged with capturing at least one of the perpetrators alive, later stated:\n\nThe other parachutists committed suicide to avoid capture after an additional four-hour battle with the SS.[14]\n\nIn revenge, the Nazis murdered 24 family members and close relatives of Jan Kubiš in the concentration camp, Mauthausen: his father, both full and half-siblings, including their wives and husbands, cousins, aunts and uncles.[15]\n\nShortly after his successful mission, Kubiš (as well as Gabčík) was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant in memoriam. After the liberation of Czechoslovakia he was further promoted to the rank of staff captain in memoriam. During the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the assassination of Heydrich in 2002, Kubiš was again promoted in memoriam, to the rank of colonel.[16][17][18][19]\n\nApart from the Czechoslovak Military Cross 1939 and Croix de Guerre (both he received in 1940), Kubiš was posthumously decorated with the Commemorative Medal of the Czechoslovak Army, F, GB (1944), another two Czechoslovak Military Crosses (1942, 1945), King's Commendation for Brave Conduct (1947), Czechoslovak Military Order for Liberty (1949), Military Order of the White Lion \"For Victory\" 1st Class (1968), Order of Milan Rastislav Štefánik (1992) and Cross of Defence of the Minister of Defence of the Czech Republic (2008).[16][17][18]\n\nThere are streets named after Jan Kubiš in the cities of Prague (close to the Operation Anthropoid Memorial), Pardubice, Tábor, Třebíč and other places.[20][21] In 2013 (100th anniversary of Kubiš's birth) a small memorial and museum was open in the house where Jan Kubiš was born. Since 2010 a National memorial and museum dedicated to all heroes related to the assassination of Heydrich is open in the crypt of Ss. Cyril and Methodius Cathedral in Prague.[22][23]\n\nCoinciding with the release of the film Anthropoid, campaigners called for Kubiš's and Gabčík's bodies to be identified and exhumed from the mass-grave at the Ďáblice Cemetery, Prague, and to be given a dignified burial fitting \"the heroes of anti-Nazi resistance\".[24][25]\n\nA memorial stone for Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík can be found in the grounds of St John the Baptist Church in Ightfield (ref W9VR+FJ Whitchurch) on Google Maps.\n• Jack O'Connell (2017) The Man with the Iron Heart\n• None MacDonald, Callum (1998) [1989].

In 1992, he served as Chairman-in-Office of the Committee of Senior Officials of the Committee on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) under the Czechoslovak CSCE chairmanship.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1992, Kubiš was Director-General of the Euro-Atlantic Section in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague. From 1989, he served in the Czechoslovak Embassy in Moscow, and as Deputy Head of the Embassy from 1990 until his departure in 1991. Between 1985 and 1988, he headed the section dealing with security and arms control in the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry. From 1980 to 1985, he served in the Czechoslovak Embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n\nHe is married and has one daughter.[3]Czech pride in Jan Kubis, killer of Reinhard Heydrich: People in the Czech Republic are marking the seventieth anniversary of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, one of the most senior figures in Germany's Third Reich. Heydrich - the overall head of security in Nazi Germany and a leading architect of the Final Solution - was killed by British-trained Czechoslovak parachutists in what was codenamed Operation Anthropoid, prompting terrible reprisals by Hitler. Alois Denemarek was one of the last people to see Heydrich's assassin alive. It was early June, 1942, and Mr Denemarek had travelled from his home village in Moravia to Prague. There, in a small park by the National Museum, he met his boyhood friend Jan Kubis.\n\nSeveral days previously, Kubis and fellow parachutists Jozef Gabcik and Josef Valcik had carried out one of the most audacious attacks of World War Two. In broad daylight, they had mortally wounded SS Obergruppenfuehrer Reinhard Heydrich, the acting Reichsprotektor of Bohemia and Moravia, as he was heading to Berlin for a meeting with Hitler. Heydrich was known for his extraordinary brutality - even by Nazi standards. Hitler was beside himself with rage. The Nazis launched a massive manhunt. \"I remember what Jan said to me when I met him,\" Mr Denemarek, now 94, told the BBC from his home in South Moravia. They had met to discuss how to help a wounded parachutist who the Denemarek family were sheltering in their hayloft. Kubis advised his friend not to risk bringing him to Prague. \"He said - look, things are a bit tense here at the moment.\" That was something of an understatement.\n\nOn 27 May 1942, as Heydrich's open-top Mercedes limousine slowed to round a hairpin bend in Prague, Gabcik - armed with a Sten sub-machine gun - leapt in front of the car and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed. Heydrich ordered his driver to halt and drew his pistol. Kubis threw a bomb, which exploded near the car, and fled. Heydrich, wounded and in shock, pursued his attackers for several metres before returning to the car and collapsing. It initially seemed the attempt to kill Heydrich had failed. But he died in Prague's Bulovka hospital eight days later, reportedly from septicaemia from the shrapnel, or possibly fragments of upholstery. \"I'm incredibly proud of what my friend did,\" Mr Denemarek told the BBC. \"If it wasn't for Jan, I wouldn't be here today. Half the Czech nation wouldn't be here today. Heydrich had terrible plans for us Czechs,\" he went on. In January of that year, Heydrich had chaired the infamous Wannsee Conference, which set out plans for the enslavement and murder of 8 million European Jews. The Slavs, according to Heydrich's plans, would be next.\n\nKubis, Gabcik and Valcik hid for three weeks after the assassination before they were betrayed. On 18 June 1942, they were surrounded in the crypt of a church. For several hours, they and four comrades held off an assault by over 700 Waffen SS and Gestapo troops, who ordered the Prague Fire Brigade to flood the crypt. Some were eventually killed in the battle, and the rest took their own lives. Bishop Gorazd, the Orthodox priest who had sheltered them, was arrested, tortured and executed. Today, a few hundred metres from the church, on leafy Charles Square, a replica of a Nazi concentration camp has been erected, part of a series of exhibitions to commemorate the 70th anniversary. Inside the grey wooden huts are exhibits documenting the lives of 70 people who helped shelter the men. \"In 1942, the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia was beginning to seem like it would last forever,\" said journalist Mikulas Kroupa, director of the Post Bellum oral history project organising the exhibition.\n\n\"Most Czechoslovaks were paralysed by a feeling of defeat and humiliation. The killing of Heydrich roused the people into standing up to the Nazis. It showed we were not a nation of slaves,\" he told the BBC. The human cost was enormous. The men's families were rounded up and shot. The Czech villages of Lidice and Lezaky - based on flawed intelligence reports linking them to the parachutists - were razed and their inhabitants shot or sent to the camps. Another 15,000 people met the same fate.Mr. Ján Kubiš of Slovakia - Special Envoy on Libya and Head of United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) | United Nations Secretary-General: United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres announced today the appointment of Ján Kubiš of Slovakia as his Special Envoy on Libya and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL).

Wikipedia: Archduke Franz Ferdinand Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria[a] (18 December 1863 – 28 June 1914) was the heir presumptive to the throne of Austria-Hungary.[2] His assassination in Sarajevo was the most immediate cause of World War I.\n\nFranz Ferdinand was the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Following the death of Crown Prince Rudolf in 1889 and the death of Karl Ludwig in 1896, Franz Ferdinand became the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne. His courtship of Sophie Chotek, a lady-in-waiting, caused conflict within the imperial household, and their morganatic marriage in 1900 was only allowed after he renounced his descendants' rights to the throne. Franz Ferdinand held significant influence over the military, and in 1913 he was appointed inspector general of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces.\n\nOn 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo by the 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia. Franz Ferdinand's assassination led to the July Crisis and precipitated Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia, which in turn triggered a series of events that eventually led – four weeks after his death – to Austria-Hungary's allies and Serbia's allies declaring war on each other, starting World War I.[3][4][5]\n\nFranz Ferdinand was born in Graz, Austria, the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria (the younger brother of Franz Joseph and Maximilian) and of his second wife, Princess Maria Annunziata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. In 1875, when he was eleven years old, his cousin Francis V, Duke of Modena, died, naming Franz Ferdinand his heir on condition that he add the name \"Este\" to his own. This inheritance made Franz Ferdinand one of the wealthiest men in Austria.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1889, Franz Ferdinand's life changed dramatically. His cousin Crown Prince Rudolf committed suicide at his hunting lodge in Mayerling.[6] This left Franz Ferdinand's father, Karl Ludwig, first in line to the throne. When Karl Ludwig died of typhoid fever in 1896,[7] Franz Ferdinand became the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne.[8]\n\nDespite this burden, he found time for travel and personal pursuits, such as his circumnavigation of the world between 1892 and 1893. After visiting India he spent time hunting kangaroos and emus in Australia in 1893,[9] then travelled on to Nouméa, New Hebrides, Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Sarawak, Hong Kong and Japan.[10] After sailing across the Pacific on the RMS Empress of China from Yokohama to Vancouver[11] he crossed the United States, arriving at the World's Columbian Exposition 1893 on the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad on a private Pullman car named Mascotte,[12] and staying at the Lexington Hotel,[13] before continuing through to New York and returning to Europe.\n\nFranz Ferdinand had a fondness for trophy hunting that was excessive even by the standards of European nobility in his day.[14] In his diaries he kept track of 272,511 game kills,[15] 5,000 of which were deer. About 100,000 trophies were on exhibit at his Bohemian castle at Konopiště[16][17] which he also stuffed with various antiquities, his other great passion.[18]\n\nFranz Ferdinand, like most males in the ruling Habsburg line, entered the Austro-Hungarian Army at a young age. He was frequently and rapidly promoted, given the rank of lieutenant at age fourteen, captain at twenty-two, colonel at twenty-seven, and major general at thirty-one.[19] While never receiving formal staff training, he was considered eligible for command and at one point briefly led the primarily Hungarian 9th Hussar Regiment. In 1898 he was given a commission \"at the special disposition of His Majesty\" to make inquiries into all aspects of the military services and military agencies were commanded to share their papers with him.\n\nHe also held honorary ranks in the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and received the rank of admiral at the close of the Austro-Hungarian naval maneuvers in September 1902.[22]\n\nFranz Ferdinand exerted influence on the armed forces even when he did not hold a specific command through a military chancery that produced and received documents and papers on military affairs. This was headed by Alexander Brosch von Aarenau [de] and eventually employed a staff of sixteen. His authority was reinforced in 1907 when he secured the retirement of the Emperor's confidant Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky as Chief of the General Staff. Beck's successor, Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, was personally selected by Franz Ferdinand.\n\nFranz in 1913, as heir-presumptive to the elderly emperor, had been appointed inspector general of all the armed forces of Austria-Hungary (Generalinspektor der gesamten bewaffneten Macht), a position superior to that previously held by Archduke Albrecht and including presumed command in wartime.\n\nIn 1894, Franz Ferdinand met Countess Sophie Chotek, a lady-in-waiting to Archduchess Isabella, wife of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen.[25] Franz began to visit Archduke Friedrich's villa in Pressburg (now Bratislava), and in turn Sophie wrote to Franz Ferdinand during his convalescence from tuberculosis on the island of Lošinj in the Adriatic. They kept their relationship a secret,[26] until it was discovered by Isabella.\n\nTo be eligible to marry a member of the imperial House of Habsburg, one had to be a member of one of the reigning or formerly reigning dynasties of Europe. The Choteks were not one of these families. Deeply in love, Franz Ferdinand refused to consider marrying anyone else. Finally, in 1899, Emperor Franz Joseph agreed to permit Franz Ferdinand to marry Sophie, provided that the marriage would be morganatic and that their descendants would not have succession rights to the throne.[6] Sophie would not share her husband's rank, title, precedence, or privileges, nor would she normally appear in public beside him. She would not be allowed to ride in the royal carriage or sit in the royal box in theaters.[26]\n\nThe wedding took place on 1 July 1900, at Reichstadt (now Zákupy) in Bohemia; Franz Joseph did not attend the ceremony, nor did Franz Ferdinand's brothers or any other archduke.[6] The only members of the imperial family present were Franz Ferdinand's stepmother, Princess Maria Theresa of Braganza, and her two daughters. Upon the marriage, Sophie was given the title \"Princess of Hohenberg\" (Fürstin von Hohenberg) with the style \"Her Serene Highness\" (Ihre Durchlaucht). In 1909, she was given the more senior title \"Duchess of Hohenberg\" (Herzogin von Hohenberg) with the style \"Her Highness\" (Ihre Hoheit). This raised her status considerably, but she was still required to yield precedence at court to all the archduchesses. Whenever a function required the couple to assemble with the other members of the imperial family, Sophie had to stand far down the line, separated from her husband.[26]\n• Stillborn son (1908), buried in Artstetten Castle, near his parents 27 28\n\nFranz Ferdinand and Sophie visited England in the autumn of 1913, spending a week with George V and Queen Mary at Windsor Castle before going to stay for another week with the Duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire, where they arrived on 22 November. He attended a service at the local Catholic church in Worksop. Franz Ferdinand and the Duke of Portland went game shooting on the Welbeck estate when, according to Portland's memoirs, Men, Women and Things:\n\nOn Sunday, 28 June 1914, at about 10:45 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were assassinated in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The perpetrator was 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia and one of a group of assassins organized and armed by the Black Hand.[5]\n\nEarlier in the day, the couple had been attacked by Nedeljko Čabrinović, also a Young Bosnia conspirator, who had thrown a grenade at their car. However, the bomb detonated behind them, injuring the occupants in the following car. On arriving at the Governor's residence, Franz asked \"So you welcome your guests with bombs!\"[30]\n\nAfter a short rest at the Governor's residence, the royal couple insisted on seeing all those who had been injured by the bomb at the local hospital. However, no one told the drivers that the itinerary had been changed. When the error was discovered, the drivers had to turn around. As the cars backed down the street and onto a side street, the line of cars stalled. At this time, Princip was sitting at a cafe across the street. He instantly seized his opportunity and walked across the street and shot the royal couple.[30] He first shot Sophie in the abdomen and then shot Franz Ferdinand in the neck. Franz leaned over his crying wife. He was still alive when witnesses arrived to render aid.[5] His dying words to Sophie were, \"Don't die darling, live for our children.\"[30] Princip's weapon was the pocket-sized FN Model 1910 pistol chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge provided him by Serbian Army Military Intelligence Lieutenant-Colonel and Black Hand leader Dragutin Dimitrijević.[31] Franz Ferdinand's aides attempted to undo his coat but realized they needed scissors to cut it open: the outer lapel had been sewn to the inner front of the jacket for a smoother fit to improve his appearance to the public. Whether or not as a result of this obstacle, his wound could not be attended to in time to save him, and he died within minutes. Sophie also died en route to the hospital.[32]\n\nA detailed account of the shooting can be found in Sarajevo by Joachim Remak:[33]\n\nOne bullet pierced Franz Ferdinand's neck while the other pierced Sophie's abdomen. ... As the car was reversing (to go back to the Governor's residence because the entourage thought the Imperial couple were unhurt) a thin streak of blood shot from the Archduke's mouth onto Count Harrach's right cheek (he was standing on the car's running board). Harrach drew out a handkerchief to still the gushing blood. The Duchess, seeing this, called: \"For Heaven's sake! What happened to you?\" and sank from her seat, her face falling between her husband's knees. Harrach and Potoriek ... thought she had fainted ... only her husband seemed to have an instinct for what was happening. Turning to his wife despite the bullet in his neck, Franz Ferdinand pleaded: \"Sopherl! Sopherl! Sterbe nicht! Bleibe am Leben für unsere Kinder! – Sophie dear! Don't die! Stay alive for our children!\" Having said this, he seemed to sag down himself. His plumed hat ... fell off; many of its green feathers were found all over the car floor. Count Harrach seized the Archduke by the uniform collar to hold him up. He asked \"Leiden Eure Kaiserliche Hoheit sehr? – Is Your Imperial Highness suffering very badly?\" \"Es ist nichts. – It is nothing.\" said the Archduke in a weak but audible voice. He seemed to be losing consciousness during his last few minutes, but, his voice growing steadily weaker, he repeated the phrase perhaps six or seven times more. A rattle began to issue from his throat, which subsided as the car drew in front of the Konak bersibin (Town Hall). Despite several doctors' efforts, the Archduke died shortly after being carried into the building while his beloved wife was almost certainly dead from internal bleeding before the motorcade reached the Konak.\n\nThe assassinations, along with the arms race, nationalism, imperialism, militarism of Imperial Germany and the alliance system all contributed to the origins of World War I, which began a month after Franz Ferdinand's death, with Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand is considered the most immediate cause of World War I.[35]\n\nAfter his death, Archduke Karl became the heir presumptive of Austria-Hungary. Franz Ferdinand was buried with his wife Sophie in Artstetten Castle, Austria.[36]\n\nThe German historian Michael Freund described Franz Ferdinand as \"a man of uninspired energy, dark in appearance and emotion, who radiated an aura of strangeness and cast a shadow of violence and recklessness ... a true personality amidst the amiable inanity that characterized Austrian society at this time.\"[37] As his sometime admirer Karl Kraus put it, \"he was not one who would greet you ... he felt no compulsion to reach out for the unexplored region which the Viennese call their heart.\"[38] His relations with Emperor Franz Joseph were tense; the emperor's personal servant recalled in his memoirs that \"thunder and lightning always raged when they had their discussions.\"[39] The commentaries and orders which the heir to the throne wrote as margin notes to the documents of the Imperial central commission for architectural conservation (where he was Protector) reveal what can be described as \"choleric conservatism.\"[40] The Italian historian Leo Valiani provided the following description.\n\nFrancis Ferdinand was a prince of absolutist inclinations, but he had certain intellectual gifts and undoubted moral earnestness. One of his projects – though because of his impatient, suspicious, almost hysterical temperament, his commitment to it, and the methods by which he proposed to bring it about, often changed – was to consolidate the structure of the state and the authority and popularity of the Crown, on which he saw clearly that the fate of the dynasty depended, by abolishing, if not the dominance of the German Austrians, which he wished to maintain for military reasons, though he wanted to diminish it in the civil administration, certainly the far more burdensome sway of the Magyars over the Slav and Romanian nationalities which in 1848–49 had saved the dynasty in armed combat with the Hungarian revolution. Baron Margutti (de), Francis Joseph's aide-de-camp, was told by Francis Ferdinand in 1895 and – with a remarkable consistency in view of the changes that took place in the intervening years – again in 1913, that the introduction of the dual system in 1867 had been disastrous and that, when he ascended the throne, he intended to re-establish strong central government: this objective, he believed, could be attained only by the simultaneous granting of far-reaching administrative autonomy to all the nationalities of the monarchy. In a letter of February 1, 1913, to Berchtold, the Foreign Minister, in which he gave his reasons for not wanting war with Serbia, Franz Ferdinand said that \"irredentism in our country ... will cease immediately if our Slavs are given a comfortable, fair and good life\" instead of being trampled on (as they were being trampled on by the Hungarians). It must have been this which caused Berchtold, in a character sketch of Francis Ferdinand written ten years after his death, to say that, if he had succeeded to the throne, he would have tried to replace the dual system by a supranational federation.[41]\n\nAfter the tragic assassination of Franz Ferdinand and Sophie in 1914, Marie Valerie, the daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph, observed that her father had placed more trust in the newly designated heir, his grandnephew Archduke Charles. The emperor confessed to his daughter about the assassination, stating: \"For me, it is a relief from a great worry.\"[42]\n\n\"The three cornerstones of Ferdinand’s political conviction were clericalism, anti-democratic views, and anti-Hungarianism,” and the basis of his worldview was that “politics is a matter only for the ruler, while the people, the masses have to obey.” Franz Ferdinand often complained that in Hungary, the glorification of revolutionary hero Lajos Kossuth, the decline of the monarchical principle, and the dominance of the Freemasons and the Jewish people was prevalent.[43] Historians have disagreed on how to characterize the political philosophies of Franz Ferdinand, some attributing generally liberal views on the empire's nationalities while others have emphasized his dynastic centralism, Catholic conservatism, and tendency to clash with other leaders.[19]\n\nHe advocated granting greater autonomy to ethnic groups within the Empire and addressing their grievances, especially the Czechs in Bohemia and the south Slavic peoples in Croatia and Bosnia, who had been left out of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.[44] Yet his feelings towards the Hungarians were less generous, often described as antipathy. For example, in 1904 he wrote that \"The Hungarians are all rabble, regardless of whether they are minister or duke, cardinal or burgher, peasant, hussar, domestic servant, or revolutionary\", and he regarded even István Tisza as a revolutionary and \"patented traitor\".[45] He regarded Hungarian nationalism as a revolutionary threat to the Habsburg dynasty and reportedly became angry when officers of the 9th Hussars Regiment (which he commanded) spoke Hungarian in his presence – despite the fact that it was the official regimental language. He further regarded the Hungarian branch of the Dual Monarchy's army, the Honvédség, as an unreliable and potentially threatening force within the empire, complaining at the Hungarians' failure to provide funds for the joint army and opposing the formation of artillery units within the Hungarian forces.\n\nHe also advocated a cautious approach towards Serbia – repeatedly locking horns with Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, Vienna's hard-line Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, warning that harsh treatment of Serbia would bring Austria-Hungary into open conflict with Russia, to the ruin of both empires.[citation needed]\n\nHe was disappointed when Austria-Hungary failed to act as a great power, such as during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. Other nations, including, in his description, \"dwarf states like Belgium and Portugal\", had soldiers stationed in China, but Austria-Hungary did not. However, Austria-Hungary did participate in the Eight-Nation Alliance to suppress the Boxers, and sent soldiers as part of the \"international relief force\".\n\nFranz Ferdinand was a prominent and influential supporter of the Austro-Hungarian Navy in a time when sea power was not a priority in Austrian foreign policy and the Navy was relatively little known or supported by the public. After his assassination in 1914, the Navy honoured Franz Ferdinand and his wife with a lying in state aboard SMS Viribus Unitis.\n\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand and his Castle of Artstetten were selected as a main motif for the Austrian 10 euro The Castle of Artstetten commemorative coin, minted on 13 October 2004. The reverse shows the entrance to the crypt of the Hohenberg family. There are two portraits below, showing Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg.[48]\n• 18 December 1863 – 20 November 1875: His Imperial and Royal Highness Archduke and Prince Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Royal Prince of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia 49\n• 20 November 1875 – 28 June 1914: His Imperial and Royal Highness Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria-Este 50\n• Grand Cross of the Royal Hungarian Order of St. Stephen, 1893 52\n• List of heirs to the Austrian throne\n• None Clark, Christopher (2013).

He was the founder of the House of Austria-Este and Governor of the Duchy of Milan between 1765 and 1796. He was also designated as the heir to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, but he never reigned, owing to the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nFerdinand Karl was born on 1 June 1754 at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna as the fourth son and fourteenth child of the Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and his wife, Maria Theresa of Austria.\n\nIn 1763, the penultimate Este Duke of Modena, Francesco III, signed a treaty with the Empress Maria Theresa engaging the nine-year-old Ferdinand to his only son Ercole's daughter, Maria Beatrice, making him thus his heir. There had been an earlier treaty in 1753 making Ferdinand's older brother Peter Leopold the heir to the Duchy of Modena, but in 1761, Peter Leopold became heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, which required a change to the Modena agreement.\n\nIn 1771, the Perpetual Imperial Diet approved the eventual investiture of Ferdinand with the imperial fiefs held by Ercole III.\n\nOn 15 October 1771, Ferdinand married Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este (1750–1829), only surviving child of Ercole d'Este, heir to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio (although the marriage was not a requirement of Ferdinand's eventual succession). Festivities arranged for this occasion included the operas Ascanio in Alba by Mozart and Il Ruggiero by Johann Adolph Hasse.\n• Francis IV (1779–1846); next Duke of Modena, married Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy.\n• Ferdinand Karl Joseph (1781–1850); Commander-in-Chief of the Austrian army during the Napoleonic Wars.\n• Maria Ludovika (1787–1816); married her first cousin Francis I, Emperor of Austria.\n\nFerdinand became Governor of the Duchy of Milan on his marriage in 1771, as long as his father-in-law Ercole III d'Este still ruled the Duchy of Modena. He and his family lived in Milan.\n\nIn 1780, Ferdinand was confirmed as Governor of Lombardy by his brother, the new Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. In 1796, Napoleon's invasion of Milan forced the family to flee the French forces. Duke Ercole III also had to flee Modena, which overthrew the monarchy and joined the Cisalpine Republic.\n\nBy the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, Duke Ercole III was granted the Duchy of Breisgau, a Habsburg territory in southwest Germany. When Ercole III died in 1803, Ferdinand succeeded as Duke of Breisgau, as well as \"titular Duke\" of Modena and Reggio. By the Treaty of Pressburg in 1805, Ferdinand ceded the Duchy of Breisgau to the Grand Duchy of Baden.\n\nFerdinand died the following year in Vienna, on 24 December. He is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nIn 1814, Ferdinand's eldest surviving son, Francis IV, was recognised as Duke of Modena by the Congress of Vienna.\n• The Sixteen Children Of Maria Theresa - Eleven Daughters And Five Sons at Time Travel ViennaKonopiště Chateau and Archduke Franz Ferdinand d’Este – Prague Blog: History of the chateau until the 19th century\n\nKonopiště was founded in the late 13th century as a Gothic castle inspired by the style of French castles with seven stouts, rounded towers and five gates. In 1327 Zdeslav of Šternberk took possession of the castle, and it would stay in his family for more than 275 years. Unlike many other Czech fortifications, Konopiště has not damaged during the 15th-century Hussite wars. During the late 15th century, George of Šternberk remodeled the castle in Gothic-Renaissance style, adding vaulted ceilings and gardens. After the Lords of Hodějov purchased the castle in 1602, the place was transformed into a Renaissance residence. Several other owners came and went, and the chateau was immensely damaged during the Thirty Years’ War. Konopiště was in bad condition when it was sold to the Czech kingdom’s highest burgrave, Jan Josef of Vrtba, who remodeled the chateau into an opulent Baroque residence. Under the ownership of František Václav Vrtba, the chateau was decorated with Rococo elements. The ceiling fresco was created in the Great Dining Hall, and Rococo-Gothic woodcarvings found a home in the chapel.\n\nHistory of the chateau from the 19th century to the present\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Konopiště came into the hands of the 24-year-old Franz Ferdinand d’Este, the oldest nephew of Austrian Emperor Francis Josef I and later heir to the Habsburg throne. He made many changes to the interior and remodeled the chateau so that part resembled a Renaissance residence in North Italian style while another section sported a medieval look. He installed much advanced technical equipment, including central heating and electric lights as well as an electric elevator. Franz Ferdinand also established the Rose Garden and furnished the armory. His collection of hunting trophies and Saint George-related items also appeared in the chateau. The chateau park was enhanced with masterful sculptures. After his assassination in June of 1914, the property was taken over by the Hohenbergs, and the chateau was nationalized in 1921. After World War I, it was plundered and during World War II, Konopiště became a SS headquarters. The state took over in 1945, and now the Central Bohemian Institute for Preservation of Historic Monuments in Prague looks after the chateau.\n\nBorn in 1863, Franz Ferdinand was the eldest son of Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria, the brother of Emperor Franz Josef I. After his cousin, Crown Prince Rudolf committed suicide and his father died, Franz Ferdinand became heir to the Habsburg throne. The Archduke had a distinguished military career but was not very popular with the Empire’s leaders because he sought to give more freedom to the ethnic groups in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and promoted federalism that would break the empire into 16 states.\n\nThe emperor strongly disapproved of Ferdinand marrying Sophie Chotková because no one in her family was a descendent of the Habsburgs or of any other European ruling dynasty. The couple kept their relationship a secret for two years. Finally, Emperor Franz Josef I consented, and the couple married in 1900, though notably absent from the ceremony were the emperor, archdukes, and Ferdinand’s brothers. Also, Franz Josef I, asserted that their offspring could not be heirs to the throne. During their 14 years of marriage, Sophie was never allowed to share her husband’s rank or title. They had three children.\n\nDuring the summer of 1914, as Inspector General of the Army, Franz Ferdinand, accompanied by his wife, went to oversee military maneuvers in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which, along with Herzegovina, had been annexed by Austria in 1908. On June 28, 1914, Gavrilo Princip, an assassin affiliated with the Black Hand terrorist group that wanted to liberate the south-Slav provinces from Habsburg rule, shot and killed the Archduke and his wife in their car. Less than two months later, World War I began. The bullet that killed the Archduke is at Konopiště.\n\nWhile the couple was given a joint funeral, the Habsburgs made sure that Sophie was just as humiliated in death as she had been in life. She was placed on a bier that was 18 inches lower than her husband’s. Furthermore, gloves representing her days as an Imperial lady-in-waiting were put on her coffin. They were buried in the crypt of their country home at Artstetten Castle in Austria.\n\nProlific early 20th-century Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek mentions Franz Ferdinand and Konopiště as well as the seven shots that Princip fired in his literary masterpiece, The Good Soldier Švejk and His Fortunes in the World War, a farcical novel sprinkled with anecdotes.\n\nThe first tour of the chateau\n\nA hunting enthusiast, the Archduke went on hunting expeditions in South Africa, Egypt, Australia, and India, to name a few places. Some 4,500 hunting trophies and 3,200 pairs of deer teeth decorate the chateau. The first tour covers representative rooms as well as official and social rooms. The Rose Room, adorned with a pink ceiling and white stucco, includes 19th-century Rococo furniture along with a stunning Czech crystal chandelier. A wedding gift for Franz Ferdinand and Sophie, the Empire-style circular table is decorated with gemstones and hails from Venice. In another room, three marble Italian cabinets made in Florence in 1680 enthrall with floral and bird motifs.\n\nOther rooms on the first tour\n\nIn the Grand Dining Room, a Baroque ceiling fresco dominates. In the allegory of the four parts of a day, the fresco shows off Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, at a wild feast. The biggest Czech crystal chandelier in the chateau, weighing 170 kilograms, can be found here. Decorative carvings adorn the walls. In Trpitz’s Bedroom, a 19th-century Murano chandelier boasts pink and green glass flower buds. William II’s Bedroom includes paintings dating from the second half of the 15th century, such as a brightly colored rendition of the death of the Virgin Mary from Italy in 1496.\n\nThe second tour of the chateau\n\nThe second tour shows visitors the oldest part of the castle, and its highlights are the chapel and armory. The 16th-century Renaissance vaulting throughout the spaces is magnificent. The chapel’s 19th-century vaulted ceiling representing the night sky is painted blue with gold stars. In the neo-Gothic main altar, the Virgin Mary and Jesus take center stage, flanked by Saint Hubert and Saint George. The 15th and 16th-century paintings and sculptures enchant with vibrant, dynamic colors. The armory is one of the biggest in Central Europe. The 15th and 16th century Renaissance sets of knights’ armor sport holes from sharp heads of spears. Rifles and pistols hail from 16th and 17th century Germany, Italy, France, and the Silesia region of what is now the Czech Republic. One piece of armor for a knight is designed for a six to an eight-year-old child. Rapiers and swords also make appearances in the collection.\n\nMore intriguing aspects of the second tour\n\nIn another room, a chandelier in Nuremberg style is adorned with deer antlers. A table inlaid with ebony shows off intarsia and is decorated with a hunting motif. There is also an electric elevator with comfortable seat cushions inside. The library includes 3,000 volumes in German, Italian and Latin. A portrait of Sophie in a dark green dress shows her holding pink roses. Part of an elephant’s foot was used as an ashtray. A 16th-century tapestry featuring King of Macedon Alexander the Great hangs in the Smoking Salon along with a 17th-century marble fireplace decorated with figures of lions and coats-of-arms. The stuffed and mounted bear there inhabited the moat until her death in 2007. Now another bear roams through the moat.\n\nThe one-hour third tour gives visitors an excellent opportunity to see how Franz Ferdinand and his family lived and is perhaps the most intriguing of the three. It includes 15 rooms of Franz Ferdinand’s private apartments with furniture of various styles, all decorated as they looked when Franz Ferdinand lived there with his wife and three children. Portraits of prominent figures line one hall. Look for Christopher Columbus and Michelangelo. Three wooden, Nuremberg-style chandeliers adorned with deer antlers decorate a hallway. A 15th-century Madonna and Child painting hang over the archduke’s bed. Many pieces of furniture as well as two jewelry boxes feature intarsia. A lighter is shaped like a dog. Graphic sheets sport hunting themes. A brightly-colored Renaissance tiled stove mixes blues with greens and gold. A chandelier from Murano boasts pink, white, blue, and yellow flower buds. In a bedroom, there is the congratulatory telegram that Emperor Franz Joseph sent to his nephew when their oldest child, daughter Sophie, was born. Even the bullet that killed Franz Ferdinand’s wife is on display as are the couple’s death masks. Photos from Franz Ferdinand’s trip around the world also are sure to enthrall. Artifacts dealing with his military career are exhibited, too\n\nThe Archduke’s game room and shooting range are another attraction along with a museum devoted to Saint George memorabilia that Franz Ferdinand collected. In the museum dedicated to Saint George, there are numerous statues, paintings, altarpieces, ceramics, and glasses showing the saint killing the dragon. A vast park boasts a rose garden with many Italian sculptures and hothouses with exotic plants."}

Jeho architektonický sloh je renesanční, konkrétně je to sloh pozdní gotiky a rané renesance, který se vyvinul v 16. století.\n\nZámek byl postaven v letech 1563-1573 pro hraběte Zdeňka Vojtěcha z Pernštejna, který byl významným šlechticem a politikem své doby. Architektem zámku byl pravděpodobně italský architekt Giovanni Maria Nosseni, který byl aktivní v Čechách v druhé polovině 16. století.\n\nZámek Libice je charakteristický svou harmonickou a symetrickou stavbou, která je inspirována italskými renesančními zámky. Má čtvercový půdorys, na který je postavena hlavní budova s věžemi a arkádami. Fasády jsou členěny štíhlými pilíři a arkádami, které jsou zakončeny štíty. Vnitřní prostory zámku jsou bohatě zdobené malbami, sochami a štukem.\n\nCelkově lze říci, že zámek Libice je významným příkladem renesanční architektury v Čechách a patří k nejkrásnějším a nejvýznamnějším kulturním památkám v České republice.", "model_id": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", "model_output_tokens": ["Z", "Ã¡m", "ek", "ĠLib", "ice", "Ġnad", "ĠC", "id", "lin", "ou",

Bn. to receive, process, and treat patients. \n\n \n\n “Expeditionary Medical Facility 150 Alpha personnel integrated with 1st Medical Battalion and Naval Expeditionary Medical Training Institute to exercise the continuum of care across the battlefield, receiving patients from 1st Medical Battalion’s Role 2 Surgical Platoons and Forward Resuscitative Surgical Systems during their Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation,\" said Navy Capt. Elizabeth Smith, commanding officer of EMF 150 Alpha. \n\n \n\n The exercise provided valuable training and practical application for both commands, but even more valuable was the opportunity to train together. \n\n \n\n “The garrison training relationship between 1st Medical Battalion and EMF 150 Alpha will directly affect survivability on the future battlefield,” said Navy Capt. Sean Hussey, commanding officer of 1st Medical Battalion. “Marines and Sailors need the Role 2 and Role 3 teams to spend as much time working together now so that the future wartime hospital system (echelons of care) is primed well before the first casualty is received.”\n\n \n\n To facilitate an austere environment, the EMF set up their Role 3 capability aboard the NEMTI training facility in the northern part of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton. \n\n \n\n “NEMTI’s mission is to ensure readiness of our medical personnel to support the warfighter in austere environments through partnerships across Navy / Marine Corps medical platforms. These events are crucial in providing an opportunity to exercise those partnerships and “train like we fight” with complete integration of Navy and Marine Corps medical personnel simulating real world operations and the roles of care,” said Cmdr. Damian Storz, NEMTI’s officer in charge.\n\n \n\n “Our continued collaboration with NEMTI allowed us to utilize their pre-positioned EMF tents, equipment, and subject matter experts to maximize our Role 3 capability,” said Navy Capt. Adolfo Granados, executive officer of EMF 150 Alpha. “This was impactful because we were in the field dealing with conditions similar to real world situations, honing our skills as an expeditionary unit.”\n\n \n\n The EMF team obtained great, realistic training and experience during the evolution that will pay dividends in the event they must deploy in support of contingency operations. \n\n \n\n “We were able to evaluate Mission Essential Tasks such as command and control, patient movement, patient tracking, and casualty receiving. We also field tested the use of Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kits (BATDOKs) that allow medical personnel to monitor patient’s vitals wirelessly, from point of injury, autonomously document patient care and transmit data throughout the patient’s continuum of care,” added Smith. “These exercises continue to demonstrate interoperability and warfighting readiness across the Navy and Marine Corps team.” \n\n \n\n The EMF team was kept busy each training day with a steady throughput of simulated casualties to maintain the operational tempo of a combat environment. \n\n \n\n “Over the course of the MCCRE, EMF 150 Alpha received, treated, tracked, and medically evacuated 76 patients,” said Lt. Jg. Amber Campaign, EMF 150 Alpha’s acting operations officer. \n\n \n\n The exercise offered the opportunity to try out some state-of-the-art, emerging equipment on the simulated battlefield.\n\n \n\n “We employed medical battlefield technology new to the Navy in the form of the BATDOKs. This is a promising tool for battlefield medical documentation and communication throughout the care continuum,” added Granados. “We will provide feedback to Naval Medical Forces Pacific about their applicability and functionality.”\n\n \n\n Taking advantage of an opportunity to include a Role 3 capability during 1st Med. Battalion’s MCCRE was indicative of similar operationally focused mindsets in both commanding officers where combat readiness is paramount.\n\n \n\n “We are fortunate to have great partners at EMF 150 Alpha who share our view on expeditionary medical care and who look for opportunities to train together,” added Hussey. “Our recent Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation was a collaborative training exercise that showcased what can be accomplished when Navy and Marine Corps medical teams work together as one system.”\n\n \n\n Granados summed up the exercise by saying, “Our personnel performed admirably, were extremely motivated, and were re-invigorated about operational medicine and the phenomenal capability we bring to the fight.”"}

Best known for competing on two seasons of the reality competition show Survivor, he became the first person to be medically evacuated from the game after falling into a fire on Survivor: The Australian Outback.\n\nSkupin was born January 29, 1962, in Farmington Hills, Michigan. When he was four, his father died of cancer.[1] His mother, Mary Louise Skupin, went on to marry Clarence Landry when Michael was ten. Michael then took his stepfather's last name, though Clarence had never officially adopted him.\n\nWhile in high school, Michael Landry became an athlete, playing tight end for the football team at Brother Rice High School in Birmingham. During his junior year, Landry was expelled for throwing water balloons at some students at a neighboring all-girls high school. For his senior year, he transferred to St. Mary's Preparatory in Orchard Lake where, even before his expulsion, he was offered a spot on their football team playing both tight end and linebacker.\n\nAfter high school, Landry tried to enroll at Western Michigan University (WMU), but he was initially denied acceptance due to the fact that no Social Security number existed for a \"Michael Landry.\" He reapplied to WMU under his birth name, Michael Skupin, and was later accepted. In 1984, Skupin graduated with a B.B.A. degree.[2]\n\nSkupin's first job after college was selling copiers for 3M. In 1992, he teamed up with a childhood friend, Greg Swan, to found Rhinosoft Interactive, a software company based out of Wisconsin. In 2000, Rhinosoft was involved in a controversy when some CD-ROM versions of the Bible, published by Skupin and Swan, were distributed into various boxes of cereal as part of a promotion by General Mills. The cereal company, which had been distributing computer games and dictionaries on CD-ROM as part of the same promotion, claimed that it was unaware of the presence of the Bible CD-ROMs. General Mills apologized for the move, stating that it was against company policy to \"advance any particular set of religious beliefs,\" although Swan insisted that the company had indeed been aware of the disc-based Bibles all along.[3]\n\nSkupin, a Christian, is also the founder of Michael Skupin Ministries, which helps people combat addiction. He had also considered running for the United States Senate in 2002, but ultimately decided against it.[4] In addition, he has written a book about his life, entitled Fireproof. The book was released in 2004.\n\nIn 2000, Skupin flew to Australia to film the second season of the TV series Survivor. He was one of 16 castaways competing for the $1 million prize and the title of Sole Survivor. Upon the start of the game, Skupin was placed on the Kucha tribe, and was almost immediately seen as the tribe's leader. At first, he disavowed the role of tribal leader, but later embraced being the tribe's main provider, catching fish for the tribe and even killing a wild pig for its meat.\n\nOn Day 17, Skupin was tending to a fire at camp, when he accidentally inhaled some of the fumes and passed out into the fire. Seconds later, he let out a scream, then ran frantically into the water as his hands were now burned severely. The medical team was called in, and they determined that his injuries were too severe to keep him in the game. He was then evacuated by helicopter to seek further medical treatment, making him the first Survivor player ever to be medically evacuated and the first to be eliminated from the game without being voted off first. Overall, he was the sixth contestant to exit the game, and finished in 11th place.\n\nIn 2012, Skupin returned to Survivor for its 25th season. He was one of three previous medical evacuees returning to the game, along with Jonathan Penner (evacuated from Survivor: Micronesia) and Survivor: Samoa evacuee Russell Swan (no relation to Greg Swan, Skupin's friend and business partner). At the start, Skupin was assigned to the Tandang tribe. One of his tribemates was Lisa Whelchel, whom he recognized as one of the stars of the hit TV series The Facts of Life.\n\nInitially, his alliance included fellow tribemates R.C. Saint-Amour, Pete Yurkowski, and Abi-Maria Gomes. No one in this alliance was eliminated prior to the merge, as Tandang did not lose one single tribal immunity challenge. After the merge, on Day 22, Skupin teamed up with Whelchel, and five days later, the two of them agreed to form a new alliance with Denise Stapley and Malcolm Freberg. At the Final Five Tribal Council, the four of them were planning on voting out Gomes, who repeatedly called Skupin a \"moron\" in an attempt to convince him and the others to take her to the end as a sacrificial lamb, as Gomes was perceived as having no shot at getting any jury votes. Gomes was sent to the jury anyway, and at the Final Four immunity challenge, Skupin won immunity, and went on to join Whelchel and Stapley in voting out Freberg.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Skupin was berated by the jury for his perceived strategic and social ineptitude. In particular, he was asked by Jeff Kent whether he was the type of person who makes things happen, watches things happen, or wonders what happened. In addition, Carter Williams asked Skupin to tell the jury why he had decided to vote Williams out. In the end, Skupin received only one jury vote, from Williams. Whelchel also received one vote, while Stapley won the title of Sole Survivor with six votes.\n\nOn February 23, 2013, Skupin was arrested for driving on a suspended license, having an improper license plate, and lacking proof of insurance. His driver's license was revealed to have been suspended approximately 20 times dating back to 1999.[5]\n\nIn December 2013, Rob Wolchek, an investigative reporter for WJBK in Detroit, inducted Skupin into his \"Hall of Shame\" for an alleged Ponzi scheme involving Skupin's financial business, called Pay It Forward. Wolchek alleged that Skupin never paid his investors any of the promised dividends.[6][7]\n\nOn February 5, 2016, Skupin was arrested for his alleged role with Pay It Forward, being charged with five counts of larceny by conversion and one count of racketeering. Unrelated to these accusations, he was also charged with six counts of possession of child pornography, as such images, allegedly belonging to him, were discovered on his laptop while police were searching it during the Ponzi scheme investigation. Skupin's bond was set at US$350,000.[8] On November 18, he was found guilty of four out of the six child pornography counts.[9] A separate trial for his involvement with Pay It Forward took place November 21, during which he pleaded no contest to a single count of larceny by conversion, as part of a plea deal.[10] He was sentenced to serve one to four years in prison for possession of child pornography, and four years' probation plus $31,800 in restitution for larceny.[11] He was released on parole, on December 19, 2017, after serving a year in prison.[12] His parole formally ended on January 3, 2021.Melissa K.

His wounds were too severe to be treated on location so he had to be airlifted from his tribe's camp, causing him to narrowly miss out on the merge.\n\nHe returned in Philippines as a self-consciously strategic player, positioning himself as the swing vote in almost every Tribal Council after the merge. He also excelled in challenges and managed not to have any votes cast against him until the Final Tribal Council. However, his lack of solid loyalty to any player besides Lisa Whelchel, as well as what some of his competitors viewed as a socially unaware, even quixotic approach to the game, caused the jury to vote the more sure-handed Denise Stapley the winner in a 6-1-1 vote.\n\nName: Michael Skupin\n\n Age: 38\n\n Marital Status: Married\n\n Occupation: President of a software publishing and distribution company\n\n Hometown: White Lake, Michigan\n\n Luxury Item: War Paint Michael Skupin co-founded a software publishing and distribution company in 1992 where he currently serves as president. He also founded the CCA, which is a motivational speaking company. He attended Western Michigan University where he earned a bachelor of business management in 1984. His previous employment includes office equipment sales, surgical and operating room equipment sales, and a water-ski instructor. He is most proud of his wife Peni and his three children, Michael (12), Kalyn (9) and Emily (3). Skupin describes himself as adventurous, a thrill-seeker, and a risk taker. His favorite television shows are ESPN's SportsCenter / Primetime (to compare notes with his son) and Seinfeld while his favorite motion picture is Meet Joe Black. Although he's a big fan of Faith Hill, he listens to a variety of music including Top 40, Country, Christian and has a soft spot for Oldies. His favorite sports teams are any team from Michigan, especially the University of Michigan Wolverines. Amid his hectic schedule, Skupin finds time to hunt, barefoot water-ski and play ice hockey. He'll also play a good game of Scattegories if time permits. Originally from Farmington Hills, Michigan, Skupin currently lives in White Lake, Michigan with his wife and three children. They have 2 Black Labradors, Thor and Simeon and lots of wild fish and wild birds. His birth date is January 29, 1962.[1] Originally from Farmington Hills, Michigan, Skupin currently lives in White Lake, Michigan with his wife and three children.

No matter what any returning player may say, you never stop thinking about going back. And: 7 cars when they turn 16, 7 college educations, 7 weddings… I want to be there for my kids at all times when they need me.\n\n Why You Think You'll \"Survive\" Survivor: The physical part I'm ultra prepared for.

I'll find a way to win, whatever it takes! I won't give up… ever, ever, ever, ever!\n\nMichael proved useful to the Kucha, being able to carry heavy loads to their camp during the opening trek. He tried to take control of the building of their shelter on Day 1, despite Rodger Bingham having more experience in the field of construction, though it did not seem to annoy anyone except for Debb Eaton, who voiced her resentment of him doing so. After losing the first Immunity Challenge, Michael participated in the unanimous ousting of Debb.\n\nOn Day 4, Michael woke up early and put rice on the fire. This upset some of his tribe because they were not hungry and considered it a waste of their limited food supply. Michael claimed he was trying to make food for the tribe before they woke up, but some tribemates thought he made the rice just for himself. The rice turned out bad, but Michael was shocked that they not only did not appreciate it, but they did not like it. He claimed that his tribe was getting edgy without food and that they were not aware of how bad it was going to get. He decided to go fishing to at least provide his tribe a full meal. Another reason for his fishing was because during Kucha's first Tribal Council, he claimed he was made the tribe leader, a position he wished to avoid, although some of the other castaways privately said they thought Michael made himself the leader. By catching fish, he hoped to shy away from the leadership position and to focus on that one activity. However, by doing this, he only further put himself in a bad position, though, by referring to himself as the leader and focusing on his accomplishments.\n\nOn Day 6, still on his quest to provide food for the tribe, Michael set out in hunt of a wild pig, generating controversy among fans. He crafted a spear with a stick and a knife, which only worried his tribe because it was their only knife and they did not want to lose it.\n\nAfter Kucha won chickens in the fourth Reward Challenge, Michael felt threatened he might become useless as a food provider now, and decided to kill and eat the chickens as soon as possible, which openly disturbed vegetarian tribemate Kimmi Kappenberg.\n\nOn Day 17, while tending the campfire, Michael inhaled some smoke and passed out, accidentally falling into the fire and burning his hands. He immediately jumped into the cold Herbert River waters to ease the pain and tribe mates Alicia Calaway and Elisabeth Filarski got into the water to comfort him until medical arrived. The Survivor medical team arrived and immediately airlifted him out of the game. Before leaving, the five remaining Kucha members vowed to win to his honor.\n\nReturning to play after his premature elimination a decade prior, Michael started his second chance on the Tandang tribe. Right off the bat, he recognized fellow tribemate Lisa Whelchel as a former TV star, but he kept the information to himself. He had the best start out of the three returning player, finding himself in an alliance before either Jonathan Penner or Russell Swan. At the beach, he was approached by RC Saint-Amour to join her alliance with Abi-Maria Gomes and Pete Yurkowski. They targeted Lisa for being considered untrustworthy, despite Michael personally liking her. He later informed her that he knew who she was, and they started to develop a friendship despite being on opposite alliances.\n\nWhen Abi-Maria and Pete turned against their alliance and recruited Lisa and Artis Silvester into a new majority voting bloc, Michael and RC were put in the minority, putting them in danger, although most of the pressure was on RC due to her conflict with Abi-Maria. However, Tandang continuously winning Immunity Challenges kept them safe from Tribal Council.\n\nWhen the Matsing tribe was down to 2 people, Malcolm Freberg was absorbed by Tandang and was promptly accepted by the majority alliance. Malcolm's challenge prowess made Tandang even stronger, and Michael was able to reach the merge without attending a single Tribal Council.\n\nThe tribe soon merged with Kalabaw into the Dangrayne tribe where Pete, Abi-Maria, Artis, Malcolm, and Lisa sided with Kalabaw members Jeff Kent, Carter Williams, and Denise Stapley (also a former Matsing tribe member and an ally of Malcolm) in order to split their votes between Jonathan, since Jeff, although aligned with Jonathan in the Kalabaw Alliance, did not want a returning player to win, and RC, since Pete distrusted her from Day 1. Meanwhile, Jonathan and RC, who knew that they were at the bottom of the Tandang Alliance, attempted to appeal to the Kalabaw Alliance in order to vote out the other Tandang members, targeting Pete, but Michael eventually shifted his vote to Jonathan who played a Hidden Immunity Idol, negating Michael's and the 4 other votes, eliminating Michael's ally, RC, who received 4 votes after the majority split their votes.\n\nWithout RC, Michael became a target next to Jonathan. After the next Reward Challenge, he, along with Jonathan, Malcolm, Denise, and Lisa, considered themselves the heroes of the game, while Artis, Abi-Maria, and Pete were portrayed as the bullies of the tribe, which would have meant that they would all stick together and blindside the three. However, Lisa realized that she could have a better chance of winning if she stuck with Tandang, deciding to still eliminate Jonathan. Their plan was foiled when Jonathan won the Immunity Challenge, which changed the plans of the Tandang Alliance. With Michael possibly being in danger for being the only returning player not having immunity and Lisa wanting to keep Tandang intact, Lisa planned to blindside Malcolm, knowing that Malcolm had Matsing's Hidden Immunity Idol, which Malcolm denied having to the Tandang Alliance. During the next very intense Tribal Council where Abi-Maria and Malcolm revealed their Hidden Immunity Idols, Michael was put in the middle with Jonathan arguing to vote against Pete, while Lisa arguing to go with Pete's \"Plan B\", Jeff. Michael eventually sided with Tandang, voting out Jeff after a 5-4-1 split with Kalabaw and Matsing, except Jonathan, voting against Pete, Tandang against Jeff, and Jonathan against Abi-Maria.\n\nWith the returning players' threat eliminated, Michael and Lisa were wooed by the newly solidified Kalabaw-Matsing Alliance to join them due to Tandang's treatment of the two. Lisa still voted with Tandang in the next Tribal Council, however, Michael eventually flipped on Tandang by blindsiding Artis (a plan of Denise due to Artis being the least likely receiver of Tandang's idol),\n\nThe next day, Lisa joined the new majority alliance with Michael, deciding to split their votes between Abi-Maria and Pete since they knew that Abi-Maria had Tandang's idol. With neither Pete or Abi-Maria winning immunity, they tried to sway Michael back to their side by blindsiding Malcolm (possibly using Tandang's idol on Pete as Michael would then vote against Malcolm). However, Michael stayed loyal to the majority alliance, with Pete being voted out.\n\nDuring those times, Malcolm and Michael talked about being in the final four. Michael was then offered by Malcolm a final four alliance with their alliance mates Lisa and Denise, where Michael first asked Lisa about it. Lisa hesitantly thought about the plan and approached Jonathan first to make a final four deal along with Carter, but Jonathan refused (saying that it would be early to make such a move) prompting Michael and Lisa to lock in the final four alliance with Matsing. With Abi-Maria winning the next Immunity Challenge with the help of the advantage she bought during the Survivor Auction, the six-person alliance turned on each other. Michael ended up being the swing vote between Denise and Jonathan after Lisa said to Jonathan that she would stick with her new alliance, and even after Jonathan's rallying to vote with him, Michael stuck with the final four alliance voting out Jonathan.\n\nBefore the next Immunity Challenge, Michael and Lisa, with the help of a self-esteem boost from Lisa's brother, Justice (who visited the island for a Loved Ones Challenge), planned to blindside Malcolm with the help of Carter. This plan failed, however, as Malcolm won immunity, with the alliance voting out Carter over Abi-Maria for being a physical threat. Michael won the next Reward Challenge, where he was allowed to select two people to join him, choosing his closest ally Lisa, with Malcolm as well. During the reward, Malcolm made a Final Three deal with Michael and Lisa and plotted to blindside Denise. After the next Immunity Challenge where Malcolm won immunity, Michael and Lisa debated to either keep Abi-Maria for being the least likely to get jury votes or Denise in order to have more competition against Malcolm to prevent him from getting immunity. During Tribal Council, Michael was called a \"moron\" by Abi-Maria for not wanting to take her to the end. Even after Abi-Maria tried to get Michael and Lisa to her side saying that Denise or Malcolm would win over them, Michael voted with the others against Abi-Maria, voting her out.\n\nDown to the final four, Michael thought of either voting out Malcolm or Denise, saying that defeating Malcolm would be honorable. Malcolm won the next Reward Challenge which would give him a huge advantage at the Final Immunity Challenge. Despite Malcolm's advantage, he ended up being the first one out, while Michael ended up winning the challenge. Even though Lisa and Denise decided to vote out Malcolm, Michael was still undecided on who to vote out. At the next Tribal Council, Michael eventually decided to go with the women, voting out Malcolm.\n\nAt the Final Tribal Council, Michael expressed to the jury being a returning player and surviving each time, saying that there was always a threat of him being voted out and that he exemplified the slogan of Survivor (\"Outwit, Outplay, Outlast\"). The jury, however, castigated him for not really being in danger seeing that he had no votes ever cast against him. Michael eventually lost against Denise, tying for first runner-up with Lisa, earning his only jury vote from Carter.\n• Michael considered running for U.S. Senate in 2001.[3]\n• On May 14, 2001, Michael appeared on Hollywood Squares as a panelist for Survivor Week.[4]\n• On February 23, 2013, Michael was arrested for multiple driving violations.

He also stated that all of his fingernails fell off as a result of the burns and that his doctor informed him that they would not grow back due to damage to the nail beds. However, Michael went on to make a full recovery.\n• Michael is the only returning player to have never received a vote against them in all of their seasons played. Both Michael and Lisa Whelchel never received a vote against them on Philippines and tied for second place at the Final Tribal Council with one jury vote each. Michael received his only vote from Carter Williams, albeit a jury vote.\n• Michael, Jenna Morasca, Colton Cumbie, and Michele Fitzgerald are the only returning players to have never been voted out.\n• Michael, Michele, and Jenna have all made it to a Final Tribal Council, but Michael is the only one of those three who has not won the game.\n• Michael previously held the record for the most improved finish of any returning player, lasting 22 days longer in Philippines than he did in The Australian Outback. His record was later broken by Monica Culpepper, who lasted 25 days longer in Survivor: Blood vs. Water than she did in Survivor: One World.\n• As part of the original Tandang tribe, Michael became one of the first six contestants to reach the merge without visiting Tribal Council.1996 - Wikipedia: This article is about the year 1996.

The goal of this new law is to let anyone enter any communications business -- to let any communications business compete in any market against any other. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has the potential to change the way we work, live and learn. It will affect telephone service -- local and long distance, cable programming and other video services, broadcast services and services provided to schools. The Federal Communications Commission has a tremendous role to play in creating fair rules for this new era of competition. At this Internet site, we will provide information about the FCC's role in implementing this new law, how you can get involved and how these changes might impact you. This page will include information listing the proceedings the FCC will complete to open up local phone markets, increase competition in long distance and other steps. You will find copies of news releases summarizing action, announcements of meetings where these items will be discussed, and charts describing the work ahead of us and where (within the FCC) and when it will be completed. Please note: some of the links on this page lead to resources outside the FCC. The presence of these links should not be taken as an endorsement by the FCC of these sites or their content. For more information about the referenced documents, contact the person listed on the document. Please let us know what topics most interest you or where you have questions about this new law.

These standards also must address the security of electronic health information systems.\n\nMandate on providers and health plans, and timetable. Providers and health plans are required to use the standards for the specified electronic transactions 24 months after they are adopted. Plans and providers may comply directly, or may use a health care clearinghouse. Certain health plans, in particular workers compensation, are not covered.\n\nPrivacy. The Secretary is required to recommend privacy standards for health information to Congress 12 months after enactment.

Thank you for asking me to speak to you today. I had a wonderful time trying to imagine who had been ahead of me on the list and had said no; I was positive you'd have to have gone to Martha Stewart first. And I meant to call her to see what she would have said, but I forgot. She would probably be up here telling you how to turn your lovely black robes into tents. I will try to be at least as helpful, if not quite as specific as that.\n\nI'm very conscious of how easy it is to let people down on a day like this, because I remember my own graduation from Wellesley very, very well, I am sorry to say. The speaker was Santha Rama Rau who was a woman writer, and I was going to be a woman writer. And in fact, I had spent four years at Wellesley going to lectures by women writers hoping that I would be the beneficiary of some terrific secret—which I never was. And now here I was at graduation, under these very trees, absolutely terrified. Something was over. Something safe and protected. And something else was about to begin. I was heading off to New York and I was sure that I would live there forever and never meet anyone and end up dying one of those New York deaths where no one even notices you're missing until the smell drifts into the hallway weeks later. And I sat here thinking, \"OK, Santha, this is my last chance for a really terrific secret, lay it on me,\" and she spoke about the need to place friendship over love of country, which I must tell you had never crossed my mind one way or the other.\n\nI want to tell you a little bit about my class, the class of 1962. When we came to Wellesley in the fall of 1958, there was an article in the Harvard Crimson about the women's colleges, one of those stupid mean little articles full of stereotypes, like girls at Bryn Mawr wear black. We were girls then, by the way, Wellesley girls. How long ago was it? It was so long ago that while I was here, Wellesley actually threw six young women out for lesbianism. It was so long ago that we had curfews. It was so long ago that if you had a boy in your room, you had to leave the door open six inches, and if you closed the door you had to put a sock on the doorknob. In my class of, I don't know, maybe 375 young women, there were six Asians and 5 Blacks. There was a strict quota on the number of Jews. Tuition was $2,000 a year and in my junior year it was raised to $2,250 and my parents practically had a heart attack.\n\nHow long ago? If you needed an abortion, you drove to a gas station in Union, New Jersey, with $500 in cash in an envelope and you were taken, blindfolded, to a motel room and operated on without an anesthetic. On the lighter side, and as you no doubt read in the New York Times magazine, and were flabbergasted to learn, there were the posture pictures. We not only took off most of our clothes to have our posture pictures taken, we took them off without ever even thinking, this is weird, why are we doing this?—not only that, we had also had speech therapy—I was told I had a New Jersey accent I really ought to do something about, which was a shock to me since I was from Beverly Hills, California, and had never set foot in the state of New Jersey... not only that, we were required to take a course called Fundamentals, Fundies, where we actually were taught how to get in and out of the back seat of the car. Some of us were named things like Winkie. We all parted our hair in the middle. How long ago was it? It was so long ago that among the things that I honestly cannot conceive of life without, that had not yet been invented: panty hose, lattes, Advil, pasta (there was no pasta then, there was only spaghetti and macaroni)—I sit here writing this speech on a computer next to a touch tone phone with an answering machine and a Rolodex, there are several CDs on my desk, a bottle of Snapple, there are felt-tip pens and an electric pencil sharpener... well, you get the point, it was a long time ago.\n\nAnyway, as I was saying, the Crimson had this snippy article which said that Wellesley was a school for tunicata—tunicata apparently being small fish who spend the first part of their lives frantically swimming around the ocean floor exploring their environment, and the second part of their lives just lying there breeding. It was mean and snippy, but it had the horrible ring of truth, it was one of those do-not-ask-for-whom-the-bell-tolls things, and it burned itself into our brains. Years later, at my 25th reunion, one of my classmates mentioned it, and everyone remembered what tunacata were, word for word.\n\nMy class went to college in the era when you got a masters degrees in teaching because it was \"something to fall back on\" in the worst case scenario, the worst case scenario being that no one married you and you actually had to go to work. As this same classmate said at our reunion, \"Our education was a dress rehearsal for a life we never led.\" Isn't that the saddest line? We weren't meant to have futures, we were meant to marry them. We weren't' meant to have politics, or careers that mattered, or opinions, or lives; we were meant to marry them. If you wanted to be an architect, you married an architect. Non Ministrare sed Ministrari—you know the old joke, not to be ministers but to be ministers' wives.\n\nI've written about my years at Wellesley, and I don't want to repeat myself any more than is necessary. But I do want to retell one anecdote from the piece I did about my 10th Wellesley reunion. I'll tell it a little differently for those of you who read it. Which was that, during my junior year, when I was engaged for a very short period of time, I thought I might transfer to Barnard my senior year. I went to see my class dean and she said to me, \"Let me give you some advice. You've worked so hard at Wellesley, when you marry, take a year off. Devote yourself to your husband and your marriage.\" Of course it was stunning piece of advice to give me because I'd always intended to work after college. My mother was a career woman, and all of us, her four daughters, grew up understanding that the question, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" was as valid for girls as for boys. Take a year off being a wife. I always wondered what I was supposed to do in that year. Iron? I repeated the story for years, as proof that Wellesley wanted its graduates to be merely housewives. But I turned out to be wrong, because years later I met another Wellesley graduate who had been as hell-bent on domesticity as I had been on a career. And she had gone to the same dean with the same problem, and the dean had said to her, \"Don't have children right away. Take a year to work.\" And so I saw that what Wellesley wanted was for us to avoid the extremes. To be instead, that thing in the middle. A lady. We were to take the fabulous education we had received here and use it to preside at dinner table or at a committee meeting, and when two people disagreed we would be intelligent enough to step in and point out the remarkable similarities between their two opposing positions. We were to spend our lives making nice.\n\nMany of my classmates did exactly what they were supposed to when they graduated from Wellesley, and some of them, by the way, lived happily ever after. But many of them didn't. All sorts of things happened that no one expected. They needed money so they had to work. They got divorced so they had to work. They were bored witless so they had to work. The women's movement came along and made harsh value judgments about their lives—judgments that caught them by surprise, because they were doing what they were supposed to be doing, weren't they? The rules had changed, they were caught in some kind of strange time warp. They had never intended to be the heroines of their own lives, they'd intended to be—what?—First Ladies, I guess, first ladies in the lives of big men. They ended up feeling like victims. They ended up, and this is really sad, thinking that their years in college were the best years of their lives.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? It was a long time ago, right? Things have changed, haven't they? Yes, they have. But I mention it because I want to remind you of the undertow, of the specific gravity. American society has a remarkable ability to resist change, or to take whatever change has taken place and attempt to make it go away. Things are different for you than they were for us. Just the fact that you chose to come to a single-sex college makes you smarter than we were—we came because it's what you did in those days—and the college you are graduating from is a very different place. All sorts of things caused Wellesley to change, but it did change, and today it's a place that understands its obligations to women in today's world. The women's movement has made a huge difference, too, particularly for young women like you. There are women doctors and women lawyers. There are anchorwomen, although most of them are blonde. But at the same time, the pay differential between men and women has barely changed. In my business, the movie business, there are many more women directors, but it's just as hard to make a movie about women as it ever was, and look at the parts the Oscar-nominated actresses played this year: hooker, hooker, hooker, hooker, and nun. It's 1996, and you are graduating from Wellesley in the Year of the Wonderbra. The Wonderbra is not a step forward for women. Nothing that hurts that much is a step forward for women.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, don't delude yourself that the powerful cultural values that wrecked the lives of so many of my classmates have vanished from the earth. Don't let the New York Times article about the brilliant success of Wellesley graduates in the business world fool you—there's still a glass ceiling. Don't let the number of women in the work force trick you—there are still lots of magazines devoted almost exclusively to making perfect casseroles and turning various things into tents.\n\nDon't underestimate how much antagonism there is toward women and how many people wish we could turn the clock back. One of the things people always say to you if you get upset is, don't take it personally, but listen hard to what's going on and, please, I beg you, take it personally. Understand: Every attack on Hillary Clinton for not knowing her place is an attack on you. Underneath almost all those attacks are the words: Get back, get back to where you once belonged. When Elizabeth Dole pretends that she isn't serious about her career, that is an attack on you. The acquittal of O.J. Simpson is an attack on you. Any move to limit abortion rights is an attack on you—whether or not you believe in abortion. The fact that Clarence Thomas is sitting on the Supreme Court today is an attack on you.\n\nAbove all, be the heroine of your life, not the victim. Because you don't have the alibi my class had—this is one of the great achievements and mixed blessings you inherit: Unlike us, you can't say nobody told you there were other options. Your education is a dress rehearsal for a life that is yours to lead. Twenty-five years from now, you won't have as easy a time making excuses as my class did. You won't be able to blame the deans, or the culture, or anyone else: you will have no one to blame but yourselves. Whoa.\n\nSo what are you going to do? This is the season when a clutch of successful women—who have it all —give speeches to women like you and say, to be perfectly honest, you can't have it all. Maybe young women don't wonder whether they can have it all any longer, but in case any of you are wondering, of course you can have it all. What are you going to do? Everything, is my guess. It will be a little messy, but embrace the mess. It will be complicated, but rejoice in the complications. It will not be anything like what you think it will be like, but surprises are good for you. And don't be frightened: you can always change your mind. I know: I've had four careers and three husbands. And this is something else I want to tell you, one of the hundreds of things I didn't know when I was sitting here so many years ago: you are not going to be you, fixed and immutable you, forever. We have a game we play when we're waiting for tables in restaurants, where you have to write the five things that describe yourself on a piece of paper. When I was your age, I would have put: ambitious, Wellesley graduate, daughter, Democrat, single. Ten years later not one of those five things turned up on my list. I was: journalist, feminist, New Yorker, divorced, funny. Today not one of those five things turns up in my list: writer, director, mother, sister, happy. Whatever those five things are for you today, they won't make the list in ten years—not that you still won't be some of those things, but they won't be the five most important things about you. Which is one of the most delicious things available to women, and more particularly to women than to men. I think. It's slightly easier for us to shift, to change our minds, to take another path. Yogi Berra, the former New York Yankee who made a specialty of saying things that were famously maladroit, quoted himself at a recent commencement speech he gave. \"When you see a fork in the road,\" he said, \"take it.\" Yes, it's supposed to be a joke, but as someone said in a movie I made, don't laugh this is my life, this is the life many women lead: Two paths diverge in a wood, and we get to take them both. It's another of the nicest things about being women; we can do that. Did I say it was hard? Yes, but let me say it again so that none of you can ever say the words, nobody said it was so hard. But it's also incredibly interesting. You are so lucky to have that life as an option.\n\nWhatever you choose, however many roads you travel, I hope that you choose not to be a lady. I hope you will find some way to break the rules and make a little trouble out there. And I also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of women. Thank you. Good luck. The first act of your life is over. Welcome to the best years of your lives."}

It began broadcasting in February 1994 as the first privately held nationwide Czech TV station.[1] Its first CEO was Vladimír Železný. It quickly achieved the largest market share in the country and remained in this position until the early 2010s.[2]\n\nDuring the 1990s, Nova produced a number of comedy shows, featuring actors like Jiří Lábus and Oldřich Kaiser. The channel also created its own quiz show.\n\nThe channel attracted some notoriety for its late-night nude weather reports (\"Počasíčko\"),[3] in which a female (and later male) presenter would appear naked to present the weather. The presenter would then put on clothes appropriate to the weather being forecast.\n\nDisputes between broadcasting license holder CET 21 and financial supplier CME resulted in an international arbitration (CME/Lauder v. Czech Republic) which ended with the Czech Republic forced to pay CME compensation of 353 million USD (approx. 10 billion CZK).[4]\n\nVladimír Železný sold CET 21 to the financial group PPF of Petr Kellner, and now TV Nova is owned by CME. The current CEOs are Klára Brachtlová and Jan Vlček.[5]\n\nSince October 2008, TV Nova is broadcast in high definition quality via satellite, cable, and also a test airing via DVB-T is in progress. Currently the signal is broadcast in 1920×1080i with a bitrate of 18 Mbit/s.\n• Nováci Every day from September 1995 to April 1996; sometimes reprised\n• Chcete být milionářem?

The scholarship program is funded by Central European Media Enterprises, to which both TV Nova and Markíza belong. The academy's two-year course is a professional training course designed to provide participants with a grounding across various film-making disciplines.[7]\n\nThe training is based around the production schedules of TV Nova, PRO TV, POP TV, bTV, RTL and Markíza and takes place in Brno, Prague, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Bucharest, Sofia and Bratislava."}

The affair achieved widespread media publicity at the time, and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, then professor at Charles University in Prague also got involved in the case to defend Leopold Hilsner. Hilsner spent 19 years in prison before being pardoned by the Emperor of Austria-Hungary.\n\nAnežka Hrůzová was a 19-year-old Czech Catholic girl, living in the village of Věžnička. She worked as a seamstress in Polná, 2 miles (3.2 km) away. On the afternoon of 29 March 1899, she left her place of employment as usual, but did not return to her home. Three days later (1 April) her body was found in a forest, her throat having been cut and her garments torn. Nearby was a pool of blood, some blood-stained stones, parts of her garments, and a rope with which she had been either strangled to death or dragged, after the murder, to the place where the body was found. Because of the little amount of blood found near the body, and the fact that Anežka Hrůzová's disappearance had taken place during the Jewish holiday of Passover, authorities and population began speculating this was a case of Jewish ritual murder (blood libel).\n\nThe suspicion of the sheriff was first turned against four vagrants who had been seen in the neighborhood of the forest on the afternoon of the day when the murder was supposed to have been committed. Among them was Leopold Hilsner, a 23-year-old Jew, a man of little intelligence, who had been a vagrant all his life. Suspicion against him was based on the fact that he had been frequently seen strolling in the forest where the body was found. A search of his house showed nothing suspicious. He claimed to have left the place on the afternoon of the murder long before it could have been committed; but he could not establish a perfect alibi. Hilsner was arrested, and tried at Kutná Hora on 12–16 September. He denied all knowledge of the crime. The only physical evidence against him was a pair of trousers on which some stains were found, which chemical experts said might have been blood, while the garment was wet as if an attempt had been made to wash it. One witness against him claimed to have seen Hilsner, at a distance of 2,000 feet (610 m), in company with two strange Jews, on the day on which the murder was supposed to have been committed and on the spot where the body was found. Another witness claimed to have seen him come from that place on the afternoon of 29 March and to have noticed that he was very much agitated. Both the prosecuting attorney,[citation needed] and the attorney for the Hrůza family, Karel Baxa, made clear suggestions of ritual murder. Testimony had proved that Hilsner was too weak to have committed the crime by himself. Still he was sentenced to death for participation in the murder, while his supposed accomplices were undiscovered and no attempt was made to bring them to justice.\n\nThe prominent Czech nationalist scholar Tomáš Masaryk, professor of the Charles University in Prague, intervened on behalf of Hilsner; he filed an appeal to the supreme court, citing technical errors in the trial. The supreme court ordered a new trial, to be held at Písek in order to avoid intimidation of the jury by the mob, and the influence of political agitation. On 20 September 1899, a few days after the first trial, Hilsner was confronted by hostile fellow prisoners, who showed him some carpenters working in the courtyard of the jail and told him that they were constructing a gallows for him. They demanded the names of his accomplices, and said he could thus obtain a commutation of his sentence. Hilsner, terrified, named Joshua Erbmann and Solomon Wassermann as those who had assisted him. Being brought before the judge on 29 September, he declared that this statement was false. On 7 October, he reiterated the statement, but again recanted on 20 November. Fortunately for those he had accused, they were able to prove perfect alibis, one of them having been in jail on the day of the murder, while the other proved, from certificates of poorhouses in Moravia which he had visited as a beggar, that he could not possibly have been in Polná on that day.\n\nMeanwhile, Hilsner was accused of another murder. Marie Klímová, a servant, had disappeared on 17 July 1898. A female body was found on 27 October following in the same forest as the body of Anežka Hrůzová. This body had, with great probability, been identified as the missing girl. However, decomposition was so advanced that it could not even be established whether the girl had been murdered. Hilsner, charged with this crime also, was tried for both murders in Písek (25 October-14 November 1900). The witnesses at this trial became more definite in their statements. Those that at the first trial had spoken of a knife which they had seen in Hilsner's possession, now asserted distinctly that it was such a knife as was used in ritual slaughtering. The strange Jews who were supposedly seen in company with Hilsner were more and more particularly described. When witnesses were shown that the testimony given by them at the second trial differed from that given at the first trial, they said either that they had been intimidated by the judge or that their statements had not been correctly recorded.\n\nHilsner was found guilty of having murdered both Anežka Hrůzová and Marie Klímová and sentenced to death on 14 November 1900. The sentence was commuted by Emperor Franz Josef to life imprisonment on 11 June 1901 but requests to renew the trial were turned down. Shortly before the end of World War I (24 March 1918), Hilsner was pardoned by Emperor Karl. He spent the rest of his life in Velké Meziříčí, Prague, and Vienna; he died on 9 January 1928 at the age of 52 in Vienna. His conviction was never annulled, and no one else was ever charged with the murders. Although the case was never solved, Hilsner's innocence concerning the anachronistic charge of ritual murder is recognized. A tombstone unveiled over his grave reads: 'As the innocent victim of lies of ritual murder, he languished in prison for 19 years'. A plaque on his last place of residence also reads: 'Here stood the house where Leopold Hilsner (1876-1928) lived before his death. As the innocent victim of lies about ritual murder, he wasted 19 years in prison.'\n• This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Gotthard Deutsch (1901–1906). \"Polna affair\".

Spanish Synagogue, Prague: 17 June - 3 October 1999 Polna Synagogue: from November 1999 Prague Jewish MuseumMurder in Polná - Exhibition to mark the centenary of the Hilsner Affair | Židovské muzeum v Praze: The myth of Jewish ritual murder, known as the blood libel, came into being at a time of religious intolerance, crusades and persecution of Jews. The first blood libel case occurred in 1235 in Fulda, Germany, and the most infamous case took place in 1475 in Trent, Italy. These accusations had tragic consequences, with the torturing of hundreds of Jews, pogroms and expulsions. In the 17th century the blood libel was particularly widespread in Eastern Europe. Not a single case was ever proved and the myth was often refuted by experts, as well as by secular and church authorities.\n\nIn the late 19th century, anti-Semitism became a means of political attack in Germany, Austria, France and the countries of Eastern Europe. It was primarily used by nationalists and Christian Socialist and radical parties in the fight against liberalism and social democracy. Berlin and Vienna were the centres of anti-Semitic policy in Central Europe. Charges of ritual murder also became a tool of aggressive political campaigns. The more absurd the allegation, the more difficult the defence against it. Just as in the Middle Ages, the allegations of individuals became allegations of the entire nation and the Jewish faith. In the years between 1881 to 1913, a number of baseless and completely trumped-up charges of ritual murder were made by anti-Semites, patriots, clericalists and radicals in Germany, Austria, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, Ukraine and Russia. The investigations, however, never revealed anything but lies and rumours.\n\nThe most infamous anti-Semitic political trial was the Dreyfus Affair in France (1894-1906), which has often been compared to the Hilsner Affair in terms of its significance. Although Dreyfus was not accused of ritual murder but of treason, the course of the trial and its consequences were similar in many ways. In both cases innocent victims were accused and condemned. However, while Dreyfus spent five years on Devil’s Island and lived to see at least partial rehabilitation, Hilsner spent 10 years in prison and never lived to see a revision of his trial.\n\nThe murder of 19-year-old Anezka Hruzova (b. 16 April 1879) took place in Březina Wood near Polná, a hundred years ago on Ash Wednesday, 29 March 1899. The body was found in the morning on Holy Saturday, 1 April. She had bled to death from a deep cut on the neck , although there was allegedly only a small amount of blood at the scene of the crime. There was immediately talk of ritual killing. Easter that year fell on the Jewish Passover, and rumours of the blood libel were revived in Polná. Although there were other suspects, the investigation concentrated on Leopold Hilsner (b. 10 July 1876), a 22-year-old Jewish vagabond of low intelligence, who was arrested without any incriminating evidence due to public pressure. The charge was backed by the local elite and influenced by a seditious anti-Semitic press campaign and by heightened Czech-German national disputes on the political scene. A key role in the trial was played by the plaintiff, the well-known Czech nationalist and radical deputy Dr. Karel Baxa. Under these circumstances and only on the basis of inconsistent and indirect evidence, Leopold Hilsner was condemned to death in the Kutná Hora Trial (12 - 16 September 1899) for involvement in the murder of A. Hruzova. The verdict was quashed on 25 April 1900 on the basis of T. G. Masaryk s protest at the absurdity of the accusation and in light of recent findings. At the new trial in the regional court of Písek (25 October - 14 November 1899), Hilsner was also charged with involvement in the murder of Marie Klimova, who had died two years previously. The trial followed the same scenario, and Leopold Hilsner, once again on the basis of indirect evidence, was condemned to death for involvement in both murders. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on the basis of an imperial reprieve on 11 June 1901, although a number of requests to renew the trial were turned down. Shortly before the end of the First World War (24 March 1918) Hilsner was pardoned by Charles I. He spent the rest of his life in Velké Mezirici, Prague and Vienna; he died on 9 January 1928 at the age of 52 in Vienna. The real murderer of Anezka Hruzova was never found.\n\nThe trial of Leopold Hilsner was factually void, and the probative proceedings were completely inconclusive. The first crime evidently had a sexual motive of a sadistic nature, while the cause of death was not even established in the second case, and anumber of testimonies included factual inconsistencies. Hilsner himself was of a timid nature and hardly capable of such a violent act. It was clear to many people at the time, as it is today, that this was mainly a political trial, greatly influenced by anti-Semitism, the nationalistic press and the tense political situation with regards Czech-German relations. Towards the end of the century the Habsburg Monarchy was floundering in a drawn-out national and political crisis, and was no longer able to defend itself against these pressures. T. G. Masaryk intervened in the trial not to defend primarily Hilsner, but to defend the good sense, pragmatism and culture of Czech political life.\n\nThe trial of Leopold Hilsner was also the first affair in Czech society to achieve such widespread media publicity - especially in the tabloid, anti-Semitic and radical papers, as well as in various pamphlets, cartoons, picture postcards, anonymous leaflets, letters and popular songs. The exhibition of the Jewish Museum in Prague features such lesser-known material so as to highlight the events of a hundred years ago from a new perspective, in the context of the political scene of the day, anti-Semic publication and the period atmosphere. It is of significance today, because Czech historiographers have so far failed to devote sufficient attention to the Polna Trial and to the Czech politics of the period. Such themes as anti-Semitism and nationalism were never too welcome in the past.\n\nAfter the exhibition ends in the Spanish Synagogue, it will be on permanent display in the newly reconstructed synagogue in Polná, which is to be opened in November 1999. On 24 - 26 November the Educatio and Cuture Centre of the Jewish Museum will host a specialist conference to mark the centenary of the Polná Trial. This will be devoted to the history and significance of the Hilsner Affair in the context of Czech politics and anti-Semitism. Further events commemorating the centenary of the Hilsner Trial can be expected in the year 2000.\n\nParticipants in the exhibition, through loans or collaboration, are: The Museum of Vysočina - Polná section, The Czech National Library, The National Museum Library - Periodical and Magazine Department, The Literary Archive of the Museum of Czech Literature, The State Central Archive in Prague, The State Regional Archive in Třeboň, The Archive of the T.G. Masaryk Institute in Prague, The Library of the Jewish Museum in Prague, Jan Prchal (Polná), Petr Vašíček (Vienna), Marta Vomelova (Polna), Stanislav Dulik (Prague), and Frantisek Banyai (Prague).Legal move aimed at reopening notorious anti-Semitic Hilsner case: The case of Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagrant convicted in 1899 for the ritual murder of a Christian girl, may be on the path to re-examination. It is the first time since 1900 that a review of the case has been ordered in an effort to reopen Hilsner’s infamous trial, which sparked a huge wave of anti-Semitism at the time.\n\nThe murder of the 19-year-old seamstress Anežka Hrůzová took place near Polná in South Bohemia, on March 29, 1899. The body was found three days later with a deep cut to the neck, although there was allegedly only a small amount of blood at the scene of the crime.\n\nEaster that year coincided with the Jewish holiday of Passover, and talk of a ritual “blood libel” killing immediately started. Although there were other suspects, the investigation concentrated on Leopold Hilsner, a 22-year-old simple-minded Jewish vagrant. He was arrested without any incriminating evidence due to mounting public pressure and an anti-Semitic press campaign.\n\nHe confessed to the charge of murder and named his accomplices while in prison, after fellow inmates told him doing so would save his neck. Hilsner was released from prison shortly before the end of the First World War after serving 18 years of a life sentence, following a pardon by the Austrian Emperor.\n\nAlthough Hilsner’s innocence regarding the charge of ritual murder has been largely recognised, his conviction was never annulled.\n\nThanks to Jaroslav Müller, a Czech lawyer specialising in defending and rehabilitating unjustly persecuted people, the case may now finally re-open. Based on his complaint, the prosecutor's office in Jihlava has been ordered to re-examine the motion to reopen proceedings in the case. Mr. Müller says this may be partly thanks to the evidence provided by journalist and researcher Jaroslav Mareš.\n\n“Mareš documented that the witnesses’ testimonies were such that Hilsner could not have managed everything the witnesses claimed to have seen. He also reconstructed the situation described by the key witness, Mr Pešák, and proved that it was completely unrealistic. It all shows that Hilsner was wrongly convicted.”\n\nJaroslav Müller says he was drawn to the case of Leopold Hilsner through his work on different cases of people from religious minorities:\n\n“It is important to me because the entire case was linked to a hate campaign against a religious minority, in this case Jews, and I believe that it should be corrected.”\n\nEarlier this year, Ladislav Müller also turned to Justice Minister Pavel Blažek with a request to order a retrial. However, the minister did not grant him the request on grounds that \"no reason has been found\" to justify such a move.\n\nMr Müller says he will now wait for the verdict of the state prosecutor’s office in Jihlava before considering next steps in his effort to clear Hilsner’s name:\n\n“There are essentially two routes for abolishing a final judgment. Firstly, the renewal of a trial and secondly, a complaint that a law has been broken. And we have now selected the first option.”"}

It has about 22,000 inhabitants. The centre of Kutná Hora, including the Sedlec Abbey and its ossuary, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995 because of its outstanding architecture and its influence on subsequent architectural developments in other Central European city centres.[2] Since 1961, the town centre is also protected by law as an urban monument reservation, the fourth largest in the country.[3]\n\nThe town is made up of twelve administrative areas and villages:\n\nThe name of the town was derived from the eponymous mountain (hora = 'mountain'). According to legends, the name of the mountain was derived from the monks' cowls (the Kutten). It is more likely that it derived from the Middle High German word kutte ('pit'). The name can also be derived from the Czech words kutit ('to work') or kutat ('to mine'), but the Czech origin of the name is less likely.[4]\n\nKutná Hora is located about 52 kilometres (32 mi) east of Prague. The eastern part of the municipal territory lies in a flat agricultural landscape of the Central Elbe Table. The western part lies in the Upper Sázava Hills and includes the highest point of Kutná Hora, the hill Malý Kuklík at 359 m (1,178 ft) above sea level. The Vrchlice Stream flows through the town.\n\nArchaeological finds show that the area around the Kaňk hill was populated by Celts during the Hallstatt and La Tène periods. At the Celtic settlement site between Libenice and Kaňk, numerous ceramic finds from the 5th–1st century BC were discovered in 1981. One of the most important finds is a smelting furnace with 10 kg of slag from the 2nd–1st century BC with traces of pyrrhotine, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and copper, which also testify to early underground mining in the Kaňk hill.[5]\n\nThe earliest traces of silver have been found dating back to the 10th century, when Bohemia already had been in the crossroads of long-distance trade for many centuries. Silver dinars from the period between 985–995 were discovered in the settlement of Malín, which is now a part of Kutná Hora.[6]\n\nIn 1142, the Sedlec Abbey, the first Cistercian monastery in Bohemia, was founded in the area of Sedlec by the monks from the Waldsassen Abbey in Bavaria. The abbey's economic problems were solved by the discovery of silver near Sedlec, which attracted new settlers, especially from nearby German-speaking regions.[6] Silver began to be mined in 1260.[7] In the early days of mining, several nameless settlements emerged. The first mention of Kutná Hora (under its Latin name Mons Cuthna) is from 1289.[6]\n\nIn 1300, King Wenceslaus II issued the new royal mining code Ius regale montanorum [cs]. This was a legal document that specified all administrative as well as technical terms and conditions necessary for the operation of mines. Shortly after 1300, Kutná Hora became the seat of the central mint of the Czech lands, in which Prague groschen were minted. The town gradually became the second most important town of the Kingdom of Bohemia (after Prague) and its main financial centre.[6]\n\nIn December 1402, the town was sacked by King Sigismund after the imprisonment of Wenceslaus IV. It was heavily defended by its residents. After several bloody skirmishes, Sigismund prevailed and forced the defenders to march to Kolín and kneel in subjugation. Although Sigismund was successful in his conquest, his hetman Markvart of Úlice died after being struck by an arrow during the siege on 27 December.[8][9]\n\nOn 18 January 1409, King Wenceslaus IV signed the Decree of Kutná Hora in the town, by which the Czech university nation was given three votes in the elections to the faculty of Prague University as against one for the three other nations.[10]\n\nIn 1420, Sigismund made the town the base for his unsuccessful attack on the Taborites during the Hussite Wars, leading to the Battle of Kutná Hora. The development of the town was interrupted in 1421, when the Hussites burned down the Sedlec Abbey and captured Kutná Hora. In 1422–1424, part of the German population was expelled and the town was hit by two large fires. Silver mining was restored in 1469. Religious peace of Kutná Hora was concluded in Kutná Hora in 1485.[6]\n\nDue to the threat of flooding in the deepest mines and the decreasing potency of silver ore, mining in Kutná Hora was reduced in the 1530s. The most important mining zone was closed in 1543. The production of the Prague groschen terminated in 1547. Despite these events, the remaining activities of the town were sufficient to ensure Kutná Hora's prosperity.[6]\n\nAs a result of the Battle of White Mountain, religious freedom began to be violated.[6] In 1626, Jesuits were invited to Kutná Hora and built here a college.[7] The Thirty Years' War caused economic difficulties. Mining was stopped in 1625. Two major raids by the Swedish army in 1639 and 1643 caused extensive damage to the town and a reduction in population. The town's economic recovery occurred at the end of the 1650s with the development of crafts. The town also began to be a centre of education thanks to the Jesuits.[6]\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, there were attempts to open new silver mines. However, the new silver veins were thin and therefore unprofitable. In 1727, the mint was closed and Kutná Hora definitely ceased to be a mining town. At the beginning of the 19th century, Kutná Hora was still among the larger towns in the Czech lands, but its importance was declining.[6]\n\nUntil 1918, the town was the capital of the district of the same name in Austria-Hungary, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia.[11] Together with the rest of Bohemia, the town became part of the newly founded Czechoslovakia after World War I and the collapse of Austria-Hungary.\n\nA factory for production of tobacco and alcohol products was founded in Kutná Hora in 1876 and is located in the premises of the former Cistercian monastery in Sedlec. In 1903, production of cigarettes began. From 1992, the factory is owned by Philip Morris ČR, a subsidiary of Philip Morris International. In Kutná Hora, the company employs more than 450 people.[14]\n\nThe largest employer with headquarters in Kutná Hora is Foxconn Technology CZ, a manufacturer of electronic components with more than 1,500 employees.[15]\n\nThe I/2 road from Prague to Pardubice passes through the town.\n\nKutná Hora is located on the railway lines Prague–Brno and Kutná Hora-Zruč nad Sázavou. The town is served by four stations: Kutná Hora hlavní nádraží, Kutná Hora město, Kutná Hora předměstí and Kutná Hora-Sedlec.[16]\n\nSedlec is the site of the Gothic Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist and the famous Sedlec Ossuary. It is estimated that the ossuary is decorated with bones of more than 40,000 skeletons.[17]\n\nAmong the most important buildings in the town are the Gothic, five-naved St. Barbara's Church, begun in 1388, and the Italian Court, formerly a royal residence and mint, which was built at the end of the 13th century.\n\nThe Gothic Stone House, which since 1902 has served as a museum of silver, contains one of the richest archives in the country. The Gothic Church of Saint James the Great, with its 86 m (282 ft) tower, is another prominent building.\n\nA recreation of the town as it existed in 1403 will be prominently featured in the Czech role-playing game Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.[19]"}

Its capital is Jihlava.\n\nThe region is located in the central part of the country. It is one of just three in the country (the others being Prague and the Central Bohemian Region) which does not have a border with a foreign country.[3]\n\nThe Vysočina Region is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the most in any region in the Czech Republic.[4]\n\nThe Vysočina Region is divided into 5 districts:\n\nOn a lower level, the region has 704 municipalities, second-most in the country behind the Central Bohemian Region.[5]\n\nThe region is located in the central part of the Czech Republic, partly in the southeast of the historical region of Bohemia and partly in the southwest of the historical region of Moravia. The entire Vysočina Region is located in the nature region of Bohemian-Moravian Highlands, from whose colloquial name vysočina (meaning \"the highlands\") the region got its name. Within the country, the region has a relatively high altitude and is the source of many rivers. The most important rivers are the Sázava, Jihlava, Svratka and Oslava.\n\nAs of 1 January 2024 the population of the Vysočina Region was 517,960, which was the third lowest out of regions in the Czech Republic. 49.7% of population were men, which was the highest share in the Czech Republic.[5] The density of Vysočina Region is the second lowest in the Czech Republic (75 inhabitants per km2).\n\nThe table shows cities and towns in the region with the largest population (as of 1 January 2024):[6]\n\nWith three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the region is home to more of these than any other region of the Czech Republic.[4] These are the historical centre of Telč, the Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk in Žďár nad Sázavou and the Jewish Quarter and St Procopius' Basilica in Třebíč.[4]\n\nThe Vysočina Region is intersected by the D1 motorway, which passes through Jihlava on the way between Prague and Brno. A total of 93 km (58 mi) of motorway is present in the region.[9] The length of operated railway lines in the region is 622 km (386 mi).[9] In 2014 a plan was announced by which a high-speed train, capable of reaching speeds of 350 km/h (220 mph) would run through the region, involving a total of four stops within the territory.[10] Construction is projected to begin in 2025.[10]\n\nIn the Vysočina Region there are two organisations providing further education, namely College of Polytechnics Jihlava"}

Although the Court did not grant summary judgment of no literal infringement, Butamax acknowledged that it could not prove literal infringement under the court's claim construction and agreed to stipulate to a judgment of no literal infringement.\n\nIn January 2011, Butamax filed a patent infringement suit against Gevo asserting two patents relating to the production of isobutanol, a four-carbon alcohol, in microorganisms. Gevo produces its isobutanol using proprietary recombinant yeast that is genetically engineered to produce it at a high yield. In June 2012, the court denied Butamax's request for a preliminary injunction against Gevo, a decision that was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in December 2012. A trial date was set for early April 2013.\n\n\"This judgment marks yet another great step forward for Gevo,\" said Jim Brogan, partner and chair of the intellectual property group.\"The ruling enables this highly innovative company to continue to focus on its growth and the development of innovative biofuels products.\"\n\nA separate patent re-examination team has obtained rejections of all challenged claims of the two asserted Butamax patents from the US Patent and Trademark Office."}

In the following years, other small farmers settled in the newly formed village. The main source of livelihood of the inhabitants was mountain farming.[2]\n\nAfter Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn.

It was known by three names over its lifetime: Czech: Československá televize, Slovak: Československá televízia (until 1990), Česko-slovenská televízia (from 1990 until 1992).\n\nIn 1993, Československá televize was separated into two companies, Slovenská televízia and Česká televize.Czech Television - Wikipedia: Czech Television (Czech: Česká televize [ˈtʃɛskaː ˈtɛlɛvɪzɛ]; abbreviation: ČT) is a public television broadcaster in the Czech Republic, broadcasting six channels. Established after breakup of Czechoslovakia in 1992, it is the successor to Czechoslovak Television founded in 1953.\n\nFounded on 1 May 1953, Czechoslovak Television (ČST) was the state television broadcaster of Czechoslovakia used as a state propaganda medium of the then socialist state. It was known by three names over its lifetime: Czech: Československá televize, Slovak: Československá televízia (until 1990) and Česko-slovenská televízia (from 1990 until 1992).\n\nČST originally consisted of a single channel and limited experimental broadcasting in 1953. Regular broadcasts began on 25 February 1954 and on 10 May 1970, a second channel was launched. The broadcast language of ČST was predominantly Czech in the first channel, Slovak for selected programming, and both for news. The second channel was split into two, broadcasting various \"national\" language programming in the two parts of the country.\n\nThe main headquarters of ČST was located in Prague, but it also had main studios in Bratislava, Košice, Ostrava and Brno.\n\nThe first public broadcasting was a short performance by František Filipovský (1907–1993) on 1 May 1953. On 11 February 1955, the first live broadcast was made, an ice hockey match from Prague.[2] Like all other media in communist Czechoslovakia, the station was subject to heavy censorship. However, as part of the process of social liberation in 1968, ČST aired broadcasts about the Prague Spring for a few days. However, in 1969, it became part of the normalisation efforts of the national media.\n\nOn 10 May 1970, Czechoslovak Television began broadcasting a second channel, ČST TV2.[3] Further technical improvements were made on 9 May 1973, when the first regular broadcasts in colour started on TV2, followed two years later by colour transmission on the first channel as well.\n\nAt the end of the decade, in 1979, a building and a studio based in Prague's Kavčí hory was opened, which became the home of ČST's news department. In may of 1988 Teletext Service was introduced\n\nAfter November 1989, lineup changes were made, with the first channel being renamed F1 for the federal district, and the second channel being split into the Czech ČTV and the Slovak S1, the first such division of channels by ČST. A third channel for Czech audiences, previously used by Soviet broadcasting, was launched on 14 May 1990, called OK3 (Czech: Otevřený kanál tři, English: Open Channel three). A replacement channel for Slovak audiences called TA3 was created on 6 June 1991 (broadcasting from August 1991 until July 1992).\n\nDuring the Velvet Revolution, ČST staff very quickly joined the side of the protesters and allowed them to spread important messages and broadcasts of the demonstrations.\n\nČST ended its broadcast with the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, with two public television stations established in its place: Česká televize and Slovenská televízia, both successors of ČST. ČST disappeared along with Czechoslovakia on 31 December 1992.\n\nCzech Television was established by the Czech Television Act of the Czech National Council (Act No. 483/1991 Coll.) on 1 January 1992, as a public television service for the citizens of the Czech Republic, with property transferred from Czechoslovak Television.\n\nOn 1 January 1993, a new concept of channels broadcast by Czech Television was introduced, which were renamed to ČT1 (formerly F1), ČT2 (formerly ČTV), and ČT3 (formerly OK3). On 3 February 1994, Czech Television freed one of the nationwide broadcast channels in accordance with the law; starting 4 February 1994 Czech Television was left with two channels, ČT1 and ČT2.\n\nIn 2005, news channel ČT24 and the following year ČT Sport were launched and on 1 October 2005 logos were rebranded. In 2013, the broadcaster added two new channels, ČT :D (children's) and ČT art (arts/culture). In April 2020, ČT3 was relaunched this time targeting the older generation / elderly. It was discontinued on 1 January 2023.\n\nThe \"Czech TV crisis\" occurred at the end of 2000 and lasted until early 2001 as a battle for control of the airwaves, which included jamming and accusations of censorship. During the Czech TV crisis, Czech TV reporters organized an industrial dispute by staging a sit-in and occupying the news studio and rejected attempts by Jana Bobošíková to fire them. They were supported in their protest by politicians such as the then President Václav Havel (1936–2011), and by Czech celebrities, but every time they tried to air their news broadcasts, Bobošíková and Jiří Hodač would jam the transmission either with a \"technical fault\" screen reading: \"An unauthorized signal has entered this transmitter. Broadcasting will resume in a few minutes\", or with their own news broadcasts featuring Jana Bobošíková and a team she had hired to \"replace\" the staff members she had sought to terminate.\n\nThe Czech TV crisis eventually ended in early 2001, following the departure from Czech TV of Hodač and Bobošíková, under pressure by the street demonstration participants and at the request of the Czech Parliament, which had held an emergency session due to the crisis.\n\nWithin the framework of television operates two television studios. Television studio Brno is based in the second-largest city in Czech Republic and was founded in 1961. The second studio is based in Ostrava and was founded in 1955. In the year 2001, the Czech government stated that TV studios have to contribute to television production in the range of at least 20% share in national television broadcasting and at least 25 minutes of regional news coverage in their area of competence.\n\nCzech Television is well known for its wide contributions to many charities. They are mainly raising money by broadcasting many beneficial programmes. As an example, every year Czech television is broadcasting a beneficial evening of well known Czech charity organization \"Centrum Paraple\" where various artists perform their mostly musical performances. Centrum Paraple is an organization which focuses on helping people with physical handicaps.\n\nCzech Television is creating and broadcasting various educational and awareness-raising programs intended for various age and interest groups. Czech television also cooperates with various domestic high schools and universities. For example, this includes, the provision of methodological worksheets, which are complementary to audiovisual demonstrations of television programs. Regarding universities, Czech television organizes program \"ČT start\" which offers various workshops or even job opportunities for students who are in their final year.\n\nSince 1993 Czech television is a member of European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which is the largest professional association of national broadcasters in the world and brings together over 70 active members from more than fifty countries in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East and other associate members from around the world.\n\nCzech Television is funded through television concession fees which are paid by all households and legal entities that own a television or any form television signal receiver. Concession fees are currently set to 135 Kč per month (around €5) since 2008. On top of that, the total number of receivers has declined by 88 thousand from 2010 to 2020 and thus reduced annual income by 143 mil. Kč.\n\nTelevision fees are the main source of funding for Czech Television and are used primarily for production and broadcasting programs. They amount more than 90% of television income according to the budget estimate on Y2020.[8] Additional income is earned through advertising where it is less successful than commercial television stations, because it is restricted by law and revenue from other business activities (product placement. selling rights to content, sponsoring etc.).\n\nBecause of the decreasing amount of payers and real fee value Czech Television responds to this by making the most of the opportunities offered by legislation to identify both individuals and legal entities who are not paying the television fee. Czech legislation is allowing Czech Television to use databases of energy suppliers to identify all households which are consuming electricity and thus potentially could own a television. Persons or households detected by this system are taken as feepayer unless they make a claim that they are not by sending affidavit. In the event of revelation, the black listener is obliged to pay, in addition to the fees due, a surcharge of CZK 10,000 for an unreported television.\n\nAddressing unregistered feepayers is associated with the cost of sending letters, and higher the need for call center operators, but the television is able to collect through this method additional tens of millions.[10]\n\nMedia occasionally raise questions about how much Czech Television is able to withstand pressure both from the governing parties and the opposition and maintain unbiased and critical coverage of politics. Most criticisms are from left-wing and nationalist parties and groups. In a long struggle with ČT is also the former president of the Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman, who in 2018 unofficially suggested creating a possibility for citizens who disagree with ČT to divert the compulsory television licence fee towards charitable and social programs. Because of perceived bias against Zeman and anti-leftist stances, some left-wing legislators (Jaroslav Foldyna and others) said they will vote against the annual report of ČT until all financial connections of ČT will be revealed. In 2013 information about incomes and salaries of ČT official Karel Burian, director of Brno ČT was publicly revealed, showing him having earned nearly 2 million CZK (about 80,000 USD) in the first half of 2011, which is much more than top Czech politicians, including more than the Prime Minister or the President of the Czech Republic.[11][12][13]\n\nThe Act on Czech Television precisely sets the limits that Czech Television has in obtaining revenues from the sale of advertising. The law stipulates that: On ČT2 and ČT sport, advertising time may not exceed 0.5% of the daily broadcast time on each from these programs (i.e. max. 7 min and 12 sec per day), while the broadcast of advertisements may not in time from 7 pm to 10 pm exceed 6 minutes during one broadcast hour on each of these programs.\n\nOn the ČT1 and ČT24 programs, advertising may not be included in the broadcast at all, with the exception of advertising included in the broadcast of a program that is in direct connection with a cultural or sports broadcast events, if the broadcasting of such advertising is a necessary condition for the acquisition of television broadcasting rights cultural or sporting events. If an ad is included, the ad time is limited as well as on the ČT2 and ČT sport programs (i.e. for 7 min and 12 sec per day).\n\nAs with their acquisition, as well as the use of funds obtained from advertising, Czech Television is restricted by Act No. 302/2011 Coll.: On a quarterly basis, Czech Television transfers the revenue from advertising broadcast on the ČT2 program to the State Fund culture of the Czech Republic. Czech Television deducts the proven costs associated with the sale of advertising from the revenue.\n\nRevenues from advertising broadcasting on the ČT sport program are used by Czech Television for production and broadcasting sports programs.[14] Teleshopping is completely banned on Czech Television. These restrictions do not apply to product placement, which is used in own creation.\n\nThe current General Manager of Czech Television is Petr Dvořák, who was elected for a six-year term by the Czech Television Council (Rada České televize) in September 2011 and re-elected in 2017. Dvorak has courted some controversy in his tenure given his previous membership in the communist party, similar to his predecessor Jiří Janeček[15] However, in contrast to his predecessor, Dvořák had relatively little experience in public service broadcasting, with less than a decade of prior experience as the CEO of commercial TV station Nova, under the direction of major shareholder PPF Group, serving as his only media experience.[16] Since departing from Nova and CME, PPF has acquired a controlling interest in the station from American conglomerate AT&T.[17]\n\nCzech television is one of the major employers in the area of film and art in the Czech Republic with 3005 employees to date 31.12.2019.[18]\n\nCzech Television Council is a supervisory authority of Czech Television. The ČT Council has fifteen members elected and removed by the Chamber of Deputies so that important regional, political, social and cultural currents of opinion are represented in it. The members of the Board are elected for a term of office of 6 years, with one-third of the members being elected every 2 years; they may be re-elected. Powers of the Czech Television Council are defined by law of Czech Television and the important powers are:\n• Appoint and dismiss the Director General and at his proposal, the Director of Television Studios of Czech Television\n• Approve the budget and final account of Czech Television\n• Oversees the fulfillment of the budget of Czech Television\n• Determine the salary of the general director 19\n\nThe Czech Television Council manages according to its own budget, the costs of the Council's activities and the remuneration of its members, as well as the costs of the Supervisory Board's activities and the remuneration of its members are paid from a special expenditure item in the Czech Television budget.\n\nCzech Television continued to use the corporate logo of Czechoslovak Television after 1992, so the logo was in use for 59 years from 1 May 1953 to 30 September 2012.\n• The startup and shutdown sequence of ČST (in Czech).\n• ČST's second logo from 1969 to 1975\n• Color logo of ČST from 1969 to 1993"}

The protectorate's population was mostly ethnic Czech.\n\nAfter the Munich Agreement of September 1938, the Third Reich had annexed the German-majority Sudetenland to Germany from Czechoslovakia in October 1938. Following the establishment of the independent Slovak Republic on 14 March 1939, and the German occupation of the Czech rump state the next day, German leader Adolf Hitler established the protectorate on 16 March 1939, issuing a proclamation from Prague Castle.[6] The creation of the protectorate violated the Munich Agreement.[7]\n\nThe protectorate remained nominally autonomous and had a dual system of government, with German law applying to ethnic Germans while other residents had the legal status of Protectorate subjects and were governed by a puppet Czech administration. During World War II (1939–1945), the well-trained Czech workforce and developed industry were forced to make a major contribution to the German war economy. Since the Protectorate was just out of the reach of Allied bombers based in Britain, the Czech economy was able to work almost undisturbed until the end of the war. The Protectorate administration became deeply involved in the Holocaust in Bohemia and Moravia.[8][9]\n\nThe state's existence came to an end with the surrender of Germany to the Allies in May 1945. After the war, some Protectorate officials were charged with collaborationism, but according to the prevailing belief in Czech society, the Protectorate was not entirely rejected as a collaborationist entity.[10]\n\nThe Four-Year Plan that Hitler launched in September 1936 to have the German economy ready for a \"total war\" by 1940 was faltering by 1937 owing to a shortage of foreign exchange to pay for the vast economic demands imposed by the ambitious armaments targets as Germany lacked many of the necessary raw materials, which had to be imported. The British historian Richard Overy wrote the huge demands of the Four Year Plan \"...could not be fully met by a policy of import substitution and industrial rationalization\".. In November 1937 at the Hossbach conference, Hitler announced that to stay ahead in the arms race with the other powers that Germany had to seize Czechoslovakia in the very near-future. Czechoslovakia was the world's 7th largest manufacturer of arms, making Czechoslovakia into an important player in the global arms trade.\n\nAfter Czechoslovakia accepted the terms of the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, Nazi Germany incorporated the ethnic German majority Sudetenland regions along the German border directly into Nazi Germany. Five months later, the Nazis violated the Munich Agreement, when, with Nazi German support, the Slovak parliament declared the independence of the Slovak Republic, Adolf Hitler invited Czechoslovak President Emil Hácha to Berlin and the latter accepted his request for the German occupation of the Czech rump state and its reorganization as a German protectorate.\n\nHitler's wish to occupy Czechoslovakia was largely caused by the foreign exchange crisis as Germany had exhausted its foreign exchange reserves by early 1939, and Germany urgently needed to seize the gold of the Czechoslovak central bank to continue the Four Year Plan. The British historian Victor Rothwell wrote that the Czechoslovak reserves of gold and hard currency seized in March 1939 were \"invaluable in staving off Germany's foreign exchange crisis\".\n\nOn 16 March when Hitler proclaimed the protectorate, he declared: \"For a thousand years the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia formed part of the Lebensraum of the German people.\"[15]\n\nThere was no real precedent for this action in German history. The model for the protectorate were the Princely states in India under the Raj. In just in the same way that Indian maharajahs in the Princely states were allowed a nominal independence, but the real power rested with the British resident stationed to monitor the maharajah, Hitler emulated this practice with the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia as the German media quite explicitly compared the relationship between the Reich Protector, Baron Konstantin von Neurath and President Emil Hácha to that of a British resident and an Indian maharajah. Neurath seems to be chosen as Reich Protector in because as a former foreign minister and a former ambassador to Great Britain, he was well known in London for his avuncular, but dignified manner, which were the personality traits associated with the popular image of a British resident. Hitler believed that emulating the Raj would make this violation of the Munich Agreement more acceptable to Britain, and as that proved not to be the case the German media launched a lengthy campaign denouncing British \"hypocrisy\". The German authorities intentionally allowed the protectorate \"all the trappings of independence\" in order to encourage the Czech inhabitants to collaborate with them. However, despite the protectorate having its own postage stamps and presidential guard, real power lay with the Nazi authorities.\n\nThe population of the protectorate was mobilized for labor that would aid the German war effort, and special offices were organized to supervise the management of industries important to that effort. The Germans drafted Czechs to work in coal mines, in the iron and steel industry, and in armaments production. Consumer-goods production, much diminished, was largely directed toward supplying the German armed forces. The protectorate's population was subjected to rationing. The Czech crown was devalued to the Reichsmark at the rate of 10 crowns to 1 Reichsmark, through actual rate should have been 6 crowns for 1 Reichsmark, a policy that allowed the Germans to buy everything on the cheap in the protectorate. Inflation was a major problem throughout the existence of the protectorate, which was made worse by the refusal of the German authorities to raise wages to keep up with inflation, making the era a period of decreasing living standards as the crowns bought less and less. Even members of the volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans) living in the protectorate complained their living standards had been higher under Czechoslovakia, which was quite a surprise to most of them, who expected their living standards to rise under German rule.\n\nGerman rule was moderate by Nazi standards during the first months of the occupation. The Czech government and political system, reorganized by Hácha, continued in formal existence. The Gestapo directed its activities mainly against Czech politicians and the intelligentsia.[20][need quotation to verify] In 1940, in a secret plan on Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, it was declared that those considered to be racially Mongoloid and the Czech intelligentsia were not to be Germanized, and that about half of the Czech population were suitable for Germanization.[21] Generalplan Ost assumed that around 50% of Czechs would be fit for Germanization. The Czech intellectual elite were to be removed from Czech territories and from Europe completely. The authors of Generalplan Ost believed it would be best if they emigrated overseas, as even in Siberia, they were considered a threat to German rule. Just like Jews, Poles, Serbs, and several other nations, Czechs were considered to be Untermenschen by the Nazi state.[22] The Czechs however, were not subjected to a similar degree of random and organized acts of brutality that their Polish counterparts experienced.[23] This is attributed to the view within the Nazi hierarchy that a large swath of the populace was \"capable of Aryanization\", such capacity for Aryanization was supported by the position that part of the Czech population had German ancestry.[24] There is also the fact that a relatively restrained policy in Czech lands was partly driven by the need to keep the population nourished and complacent so that it can carry out the vital work of arms production in the factories. By 1939, the country was already serving as a major hub of military production for Germany, manufacturing aircraft, tanks, artillery, and other armaments.[25]\n\nThe Czechs demonstrated against the occupation on 28 October 1939, the 21st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. The death on 15 November 1939 of a medical student, Jan Opletal, who had been wounded in the October violence, precipitated widespread student demonstrations, and the Germans retaliated. Politicians were arrested en masse, as were an estimated 1,800 students and teachers. On 17 November, all universities and colleges in the protectorate were closed, nine student leaders were executed, and 1,200 were sent to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp within Nazi Germany; further arrests and executions of Czech students and professors took place later during the occupation.[26] (See also Czech resistance to Nazi occupation)\n\nDuring World War II, Hitler decided that Neurath was not treating the Czechs harshly enough and adopted a more radical policy in the protectorate. On 29 September 1941, Hitler appointed SS hardliner Reinhard Heydrich as Deputy Reichsprotektor (Stellvertretender Reichsprotektor). At the same time, he relieved Neurath of his day-to-day duties. For all intents and purposes, Heydrich replaced Neurath as Reichsprotektor. Under Heydrich's authority Prime Minister Alois Eliáš was arrested (and later executed), the Czech government was reorganized, and all Czech cultural organizations were closed. The Gestapo arrested and murdered people. The deportation of Jews to concentration camps was organized, and the fortress town of Terezín was made into a ghetto way-station for Jewish families.\n\nOn 4 June 1942, Heydrich died after being wounded by Czechoslovak Commandos in Operation Anthropoid. Directives issued by Heydrich's successor, SS-Oberstgruppenführer Kurt Daluege, and martial law brought forth mass arrests, executions and the obliteration of the villages of Lidice and Ležáky. In 1943 the German war-effort was accelerated. Under the authority of Karl Hermann Frank, German minister of state for Bohemia and Moravia, within the protectorate, all non-war-related industry was prohibited. Most of the Czech population obeyed quietly until the final months preceding the end of the war, when thousands became involved in the resistance movement.\n\nFor the Czechs of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, German occupation represented a period of oppression. The number of Czech victims of political persecution and murders in concentration camps totalled between 36,000 and 55,000.[27] After Heydrich assumed control of the Protectorate, he instituted martial law and stepped up arrests and executions of resistance fighters.[28] Heydrich allegedly referred to Czechs as \"laughing beasts\", reflecting Czech subversion and Nazi racial beliefs about the inferiority of Czechs.[29][30]\n\nThe Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia (118,000 according to the 1930 census) was virtually annihilated, with over 75,000 murdered.[27] Of the 92,199 people classified as Jews by German authorities in the Protectorate as of 1939, 78,154 were murdered in the Holocaust, or 85 percent.[31]\n\nMany Jews emigrated after 1939; 8,000 survived at the Terezín concentration camp, which was used for propaganda purposes as a showpiece.[27] Several thousand Jews managed to live in freedom or in hiding throughout the occupation. The extermination of the Romani population was so thorough that the Bohemian Romani language became totally extinct. Romani internees were sent to the Lety and Hodonín concentration camps before being transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau for gassing.[citation needed] The vast majority of Romani in the Czech Republic today descend from migrants from Slovakia who moved there within post-war Czechoslovakia.[citation needed] The Theresienstadt concentration camp was located in the Protectorate, near the border to the Reichsgau Sudetenland. It was designed to concentrate the Jewish population from the Protectorate and gradually move them to extermination camps, and it also held Western European and German Jews. While not an extermination camp itself, the harsh and unhygienic conditions still resulted in the death of 33,000 of the 140,000 Jews brought to the camp while a further 88,000 were sent to extermination camps, and only 19,000 survived.[32]\n\nAfter the establishment of the Protectorate all political parties were outlawed, with the exception of the National Partnership (Národní souručenství). Membership of the Národní souručenství was closed to women and Jews. In the spring of 1939, about 2,130,000 men joined the group, amounting to between 98%-99% of the Czech male population. However, much of the registration for the Národní souručenství was done in the style of a census (a traditional outlet for nationalist feeling in the Czech lands), and the messages advocating joining the Národní souručenství emphasized that the group existed to affirm the Czech character of Bohemia-Moravia.\n\nOne spy for the government-in-exile in London reported: \"The original, observable chaos and later fear of Gestapo informants and uncertainty has changed to courage and hope. The nation is coming together, not only in the National Solidarity Movement, which the majority did only to avoid losing our national existence, but individuals are coming together and one begins to feel if the nation has a backbone again\". This local Czech Fascist party was led by a ruling Presidium until 1942, after which a Vůdce (Leader) for the party was appointed.\n\nUltimate authority within the Protectorate was held by the Reich Protector (Reichsprotektor), the area's senior Nazi administrator, whose task it was to represent the interests of the German state. The office and title were held by a variety of persons during the Protectorate's existence. In succession these were:\n\nKonstantin von Neurath, former Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany (1932–1938) and Minister without Portfolio (1938–1945). He was placed on leave in September 1941 after Hitler's dissatisfaction with his \"soft policies\", although he still held the title of Reichsprotektor until his official resignation in August 1943.\n\nReinhard Heydrich, chief of the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Main Office) or RSHA. He was officially only a deputy to Neurath, but in reality was granted supreme authority over the entire state apparatus of the Protectorate.\n\nKurt Daluege, Chief of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police) or Orpo, in the Interior Ministry, who was also officially a deputy Reich Protector.\n\nWilhelm Frick, former Minister of the Interior (1933–1943) and Minister without Portfolio (1943–1945).\n\nNext to the Reich Protector there was also a political office of State Secretary (from 1943 known as the State Minister to the Reich Protector) who handled most of the internal security. From 1939 to 1945 this person was Karl Hermann Frank the senior SS and Police Leader in the Protectorate. A command of the Allgemeine-SS was also established, known as the SS-Oberabschnitt Böhmen-Mähren. The command was an active unit of the General-SS, technically the only such unit to exist outside of Germany, since most other Allgemeine-SS units in occupied or conquered countries were largely paper commands.\n\nThe Czech State President (Státní Prezident) under the period of German rule from 1939 to 1945 was Emil Hácha (1872–1945), who had been the President of the Second Czechoslovak Republic since November 1938. Rudolf Beran (1887–1954) continued to hold the office of Minister President (Předseda vlády) after the German take-over. He was replaced by Alois Eliáš on 27 April 1939, who was himself also sacked on 2 October 1941 not long after the appointment of Reinhard Heydrich as the new Reich Protector. Because of his contacts with the Czechoslovak government-in-exile Eliáš was sentenced to death, and the execution was carried out on 19 June 1942 shortly after Heydrich's own death. From 19 January 1942 the government was led by Jaroslav Krejčí, and from January to May 1945 by Richard Bienert, the former police chief of Prague. When the dissolution of the Protectorate was proclaimed after the Liberation of Prague, a radio call was issued for Bienert's arrest. This resulted in his conviction to a three-year prison term in 1947, during which he died in 1949.\n\nAside from the Office of the Minister President, the local Czech government in the Protectorate consisted of the Ministries of Education, Finance, Justice, Trade, the Interior, Agriculture, and Public Labour. The area's foreign policy and military defence were under the exclusive control of the German government. The former foreign minister of Czechoslovakia František Chvalkovský became a Minister without Portfolio and permanent representative of the Czech administration in Berlin.\n\nThe most prominent Czech politicians in the Protectorate included:\n\nThe area of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia contained about 7,380,000 inhabitants in 1940. 225,000 (3.3%) of these were of German origin, while the rest were mainly ethnic Czechs as well as some Slovaks, particularly near the border with Slovakia.[citation needed] Ethnic Germans were offered Reich citizenship, while Jews and Czechs were from the outset second-class citizens (\"Protectorate subjects\", German: Protektoratsangehörige).\n\nThe Nazis aimed for the protectorate to become fully Germanized. Marriages between Czechs and Germans became a problem for the Nazis.[35] In 1939, the Nazis did not ban sexual relations between Germans and Czechs and no law prohibited Jews from marrying Czechs.[35] The Nazis made German women who married any non-Germans lose their Reich citizenship whereas Czech women who married German men were accepted into the German Volk.[35] Czech families aiming to improve their lives in the protectorate encouraged their Czech daughters to marry German men as it was one way to save a family business.[35]\n\nHitler had approved a plan designed by Konstantin von Neurath and Karl Hermann Frank, which projected the Germanization of the \"racially valuable\" half of the Czech population after the end of the war.[36] This consisted mainly of industrial workers and farmers.[36] The undesirable half contained the intelligentsia, whom the Nazis viewed as ungermanizable and potential dangerous instigators of Czech nationalism. Some 9,000 Volksdeutsche from Bukovina, Dobruja, South Tyrol, Bessarabia, Sudetenland and the Altreich were settled in the protectorate during the war.[36] The goal was to create a German settlement belt from Prague to Sudetenland, and to turn the surroundings of Olomouc (Olmütz), České Budějovice (Budweis), Brno (Brünn) and the area near the Slovak border into German enclaves.[36]\n\nFurther integration of the protectorate into the Reich was carried out by the employment of German apprentices, by transferring German evacuee children into schools located in the protectorate, and by authorizing marriages between Germans and \"assimilable\" Czechs.[36] Germanizable Czechs were allowed to join the Reich Labour Service and to be admitted to German universities.[36]\n\nIn common with the other \"submerged\" nations of Eastern Europe, the Czech intelligentsia had an immense prestige as the bearers and protectors of the national culture, who would keep the Czech language and culture alive when the Czech nation was \"submerged\". No segment of the Czech intelligentsia faced more pressure to conform to the occupation policy than school teachers. Frank called the teachers \"the most dangerous wing of the intelligentsia\" while Heydrich referred to the teachers as \"the training core of the opposition Czech government [in exile in London]\". To keep their jobs, teachers were required to demonstrate fluency in German and were supposed to greet their students with the fascist salute while saying \"Sieg Heil!\" (\"Hail Victory!\"). School inspectors made surprise visits to the classrooms and all chairpersons of the exam boards had to be ethnic Germans. Some teachers and students were Gestapo informers, which spread a climate of mistrust and paranoia across the school system as both teachers and students never knew whom to trust. One teacher recalled: \"The Gestapo even had informers and agents amongst the children. Uncertainty and mistrust destroyed any feeling of comradeship among the children\".\n\nDespite these pressures, a number of Czech teachers quietly inserted \"anti-Reich\" ideas into their lessons while refusing to greet their students with \"Sieg Heil!\". Especially under Frank, the teachers suffered harshly. In the first six months of 1944, about 1,000 Czech teachers were either executed or imprisoned. By 1945, about 5,000 Czech teachers were imprisoned in the concentration camps, where a fifth died. By the end of the occupation, about 40% of all Czech teachers had been fired with the figure reaching 60% in Prague.\n\nFor administrative purposes the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was divided into two Länder: Böhmen (Bohemia) and Mähren (Moravia). Each of these was further subdivided into Oberlandratsbezirke, each comprising a number of Bezirke.[38]\n\nFor party administrative purposes the Nazi Party extended its Gau system to Bohemia and Moravia when the Protectorate was established. This step divided the remaining parts of Bohemia and Moravia up between its four surrounding Gaue:\n\nThe resulting government overlap led to the usual authority conflicts typical of the Nazi era. Seeking to extend their own powerbase and to facilitate the area's Germanization the Gauleiters of the surrounding districts continually agitated for the liquidation of the Protectorate and its direct incorporation into the German Reich. Hitler stated as late as 1943 that the issue was still to be decisively settled.[39]\n\nLike in other occupied countries, the German military in Bohemia and Moravia was commanded by a Wehrmachtbefehlshaber. Through the year, the headquarter received several different names because of the complex structure of the Reichsprotektorat: Wehrmachtbevollmächtigter beim Reichsprotektor in Böhmen und Mähren, Wehrmachtbefehlshaber beim Reichsprotektor in Böhmen und Mähren and Wehrmachtbefehlshaber beim deutschen Staatsminister in Böhmen und Mähren. The commander also held the position of the Befehlshaber im Wehrkreis Böhmen und Mähren.[citation needed]\n• Lists of political office-holders in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\n• None Gruner, Wolf (2015). \"Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\".

In 1991, he was one of the co-founders of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). Becoming an MP in 1993, he served as a member of the Foreign Committee of the Chamber of Deputies and three years later he became Chairman of the Committee on Security. In 2006 Nečas was appointed as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs under the leadership of Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek. In the Chamber of Deputies, he was given the nickname Fidel by the communist MPs due to his long filibustering speeches.[1] The 2010 legislative election led to Nečas becoming Prime Minister as the head of a coalition government with TOP 09 and Public Affairs (VV) (later replaced by Liberal Democrats). His premiership was marked by the effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. The cabinet led by Nečas pushed through laws on the restitution of the properties of the Christian churches, pensionary reform and reform of the colleges; all of these were deeply unpopular and were much criticized.\n\nNečas resigned on 17 June 2013 due to police investigation in which his chief of staff Jana Nagyová (now Jana Nečasová), who was also his mistress, was arrested. His resignation opened the way to the 2013 snap election, where his party ODS was marginalized to only 16 seats, the lowest in its history, and sent into opposition.\n\nHe has been praised for the savings made to rein in the Czech Republic's national debt. His critics often accuse him of corruption and criticise his inability to solve healthcare issues.[2] In May 2023, Nečas was convicted of perjury and issued a fine, becoming the first prime minister in history to be found guilty of a criminal offense.[3]\n\nNečas was born in Uherské Hradiště, Czech Republic, on 19 November 1964.[4] He attended gymnasium in Uherské Hradiště from 1979 to 1983. He graduated from the Faculty of Science at the University of J.E. Purkyně in Brno in 1988.[4]\n\nNečas met his future wife, Radka Nečasová, at school when he was 18. In 2013, he filed for divorce and not long after married his former chief of staff, Jana Nagyová.[citation needed]\n\nNečas studied plasma physics. Before he was elected to the Czech Parliament, he worked as a research and development engineer in the semiconductor industry, dealing with plasma processes. From 1988 to 1992, he worked as developer for Tesla Rožnov. He became a member of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in 1991 and was named deputy defence minister in 1995. One year later, he was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies. From 4 September 2006 to 8 May 2009, Nečas was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs.\n\nIn March 2010, he replaced Mirek Topolánek as leader of the party. The Civic Democratic Party came second in the 2010 Czech legislative election and shortly after Nečas announced his intention to stand for the post of party chairman.[5][6]\n\nIn 2011, Nečas supported European organizations signing an agreement on the establishment of the Platform of European Memory and Conscience for studies on the totalitarian past. On this occasion, Nečas highlighted that all four countries of the Visegrád Group have gone through two totalitarian regimes in their modern history. \"This must not be forgotten, because it was a period of fighting for freedom\", he said, adding: \"Our nations deserve the truth about their past and I believe that the establishment of this Platform will help to find the truth about this history\".\n\nIn 2012, Nečas urged all Czechs to avoid drinking \"any alcohol whose origin is uncertain\" due to a fatal methanol poisoning affair in the Czech Republic which caused more than 40 casualties, including several cases of people being blinded.\n\nIn 2013, Nečas supported Israel with the Czech Republic's vote at the United Nations.[7] Due to an historical affinity, Nečas claimed: \"We've got a special feeling for Israel's situation—that of a small nation surrounded by enemies.\"[8]\n\nIn June 2013, the Police Unit for Combating Organized Crime and the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Olomouc organized a raid against organized crime. It involved several high-ranking state officials and politicians, including Jana Nagyova, then-chief of staff of Prime Minister Nečas. Initially Nečas refused to resign but he finally did so on 17 June.[9][10] In February 2014, the police charged him with bribery.[11]\n\nUpon leaving politics in 2013, Nečas started to work for SPGroup and also became a tutor at CEVRO Institute.[12] In June 2017, he became an adviser to Pavel Sehnal, leader of the newly established Civic Democratic Alliance.[13] Sehnal stated that the party would stand Nečas in elections if the latter did not have to face charges from the time of his premiership.[14]\n\nPetr Necas is a Member of the Prague Society for International Cooperation and has been a long-standing supporter since its founding in 1997.Prime Minister Petr Nečas visits Czech troops in Afghanistan | Government of the Czech Republic: At the weekend Prime Minister Petr Nečas made his first visit to Czech troops in Afghanistan. He spent Saturday at the base of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Kabul, then moved on Sunday to the Shank base in Logar.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday 1st September, Prime Minister Nečas met General Adrian Bradshaw, second in command of ISAF in Kabul at an official meeting. The prime minister discussed with him in particular the military aspects of the ISAF mission in Afghanistan and the process of transition to the hands of Afghan security forces and the Afghan authorities.\n\n\"The Czech Republic stands out here as a very solid and reliable partner. We clearly believe that we must pursue a strategy of \"in together, out together.\" We're also able to respond very flexibly to the requirements. The Czech Republic has for example strengthened the air advisory team here in Kabul with thirty helicopter maintenance specialists. We also have our soldiers in Logar and Wardak. We wish to be a genuinely reliable ally and we also have a clear idea of what to do next with those units, i.e. transforming them into military advisory teams\", said the prime minister after the meeting.\n\nAccording to the prime minister the security situation has fluctuations, but cooperation between Afghan security forces and ISAF troops will lead to a gradual improvement in the security situation. \"Together with Chief of the General Staff Peter Paul, we have also appreciated the strong support of units of the United States Army for Czech troops, allowing the latter to focus better on their tasks\", said Prime Minister Nečas. The leadership of the ISAF mission very much appreciates the contribution of the Czech Republic, its reliability and the fact that the Czech Republic does not decrease the number of its soldiers in response to populist political pressures. \"Of course there is strong interest here in further developing the Afghan security forces, i.e. an effort to have advisory teams not only in the military field, but also for example in the police, because a number of security challenges today are met by police forces rather than by military units\", said Petr Nečas.\n\nIn Kabul the prime minister also met with Czech ambassador Petr Pelz. In the afternoon, he greeted members of the 5th Czech Army ISAF Task Force, praising their NATO medal contribution. \"Even this short stay has strongly enhanced my admiration and gratitude to the soldiers of the Czech Army, because here they genuinely operate in extremely difficult conditions, risk their health and lives, and are here for the security of Europe, and therefore of the Czech Republic, fulfilling their combat tasks here; I have to say that as a citizen I am proud of them\", he added. Later, Prime Minister Nečas met commanders from the Task Force, the National Support Element, units of chemical and biological defence, the aviation advisory team and field surgical team.\n\nOn Sunday 2nd September the delegation of Prime Minister Petr Nečas moved to the Shank forward operating base in Logar province, where the 10th Provincial Reconstruction Team operates. After meeting the commander of the military section the prime minister met members of the civilian part of the PRT, inspected military technology and had brief discussions with soldiers. The prime minister thanked the members of the PRT in particular for their work in hazardous environments such as Logar province and wished them a successful completion to their mission. \"You are doing excellent work, you have my respect and I wish you a safe return home\", the prime minister sent in a message to Czech soldiers at the Solthan Kheyl operations point in Waldak, where one of the terrorist attacks took place yesterday and where the prime minister in the end did not fly for security reasons."}

Conformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions. Applications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\n\nThe purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to support studies of the human virome and its role in cardiovascular, pulmonary and hematological health, resilience, and diseases. This FOA seeks applications that aim to identify and evaluate the basic molecular and physiological mechanisms that underlie how the virome may be influencing heart, lung and blood health and disease.\n\nThe human microbiome comprises the bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms living in association with the human body. The human virome consists of viruses that infect human cells, virus-derived elements in our chromosomes, and bacteriophages that infect the broad array of bacteria that inhabit the body.\n\nThe NIH Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and other studies have allowed us to better understand the importance of bacteria and have led to the realization of the potential importance of the virome for health, resilience, and diseases. For example, gut bacteria play a role in the formation of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite shown to be linked to atherosclerosis, and bacteriophages in the gut which affect the gut flora may affect TMAO formation. A recent study showed higher levels of circulating cell free DNA, in particular, cell-free microbial DNA (microbiome), among cardiovascular disease patients (valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease and congenital heart disease) compared to healthy individuals. Among a subset of those subjects studied, the circulating virome in cardiovascular disease patients was enriched with bacteriophages containing a preponderance of Propionibacterium phages, followed by Pseudomonas phages and Rhizobium phages. Specific expansion of bacteriophages in Crohn’s disease has been associated with decreased bacterial diversity. Research has suggested that respiratory viruses and the consequent response of the innate immune system could also drive the development of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Many viruses can persist in cells such as hematopoietic cells and vascular endothelial cells, and can influence the host in profound ways independent of classical viral disease. The immune system is continuously stimulated by chronic systemic viruses and this aspect of host-microbiome interactions appears specific to the virome. The virome is considered one of the drivers of idiopathic systemic inflammation that has been linked to many severe public health threats, including cardiovascular diseases. Some viruses may be protective; for example, hepatitis G virus (GB virus C or HGV) may have a protective effect against HIV-associated disease. Cytomegalovirus, a highly prevalent virus, appears to promote recipient T-cell immunity following reduced-intensity T-cell-depleted hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. While these initial reports highlight the potential role of the virome in health, resilience and disease, the basic molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying these effects are not known. Many human viruses have been understudied so far. There are many viral elements present in blood other than the major known pathogenic viruses. Two examples of this include the recently identified Giant Blood Marseillevirus and the identification of anelloviruses in the majority of individuals. The effect, if any, of these viruses on heart, lung, and blood health and/or disease is not known. Additionally, the effect of transfusing blood products and their \"viromes\" on the patients who receive these common therapeutics is not known. For example, transfusion of blood to fetuses and infants whose immune system is in development could potentially have a profound impact on their health, whether helpful or harmful. It is well recognized that exposure to viruses early in life could have a very different health impact compared to similar exposure during adulthood. For example, 90% of infants exposed to hepatitis B virus become chronically infected but 95% of infected adults are able to recover completely. In the United States alone as many as 40,000 transfusions are given annually to those younger than 1 year old , but the impact of the infused virome on their health, for example in shaping and regulating immunity and tolerance, is not yet known.\n\nResearch that will be supported by this FOA includes but is not limited to the following:\n• Blood virome and its effect on transfusion recipients.\n• Interactions between the virome and the microbiome, including in the context of HIV infection.\n• Fetal origins of adult disease how the virome in utero affects later life.\n• Role of the virome in shaping lung mucosal immunity, including the innate immune response to inhaled toxicants and regulation of mucus hyper secretion.\n• Role the virome plays in affecting the lung flora and immune system.\n• Role of the virome in heart health and diseases such as myocarditis.\n• Role of the virome in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) exacerbation.\n• Role of the virome in respiratory bacterial exacerbations.\n• Effects of the virome on endothelium, coagulation and thrombus formation, particularly effects on platelets.\n• Role of genetic determinants in affecting the interactions between HIV and the virome\n• Mechanisms by which interactions between HIV and the virome contribute to heart, lung, and blood co-morbidities as well as HIV pathogenesis and chronic inflammation.\n• Role of the virome in heart, lung and blood health in the context of medical and pharmacological interventions such as transfusion, mechanical intubation, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and treatment of HIV infection with anti-retroviral therapy.\n\nResearch supported by this program is expected to be primarily hypothesis-generating in nature. Purely descriptive or correlative studies will not be considered responsive, unless such applications target identification of new virome elements and include study of the molecular and physiological mechanisms by which these newly identified virome elements may impact heart, lung or blood cells. Well known viruses can be included in studies of the molecular and physiological mechanisms because known viruses could inform research on unknown viruses; further, it may be very important to study interactions among all relevant virome elements.\n\nResearch applications that can leverage cohorts or populations from other programs including global initiatives such as international sickle cell disease programs as well as global AIDS programs are encouraged. Stored samples, such as those in the NHLBI repository (https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/) may be of interest, but investigators should be aware that stored samples may only be good for certain studies of selected virome elements but not others. How stored samples were collected, handled, and stored should be taken into consideration if their use is proposed.\n\nThe R61/R33 mechanism supports bi-phasic innovation awards that include an initial R61 phase and a second R33 phase. This FOA seeks applications that propose research plans for both the R61 and R33 phases and also includes milestones to be achieved during the R61 phase to qualify for the transition to the R33 phase. This funding mechanism is especially suitable for HLB-related virome innovation research in view of the scarcity of knowledge regarding the virome and potential challenges in carrying out such research.\n\nThis FOA is intended to support innovative applications that propose an exploratory and developmental 1- to 2-year R61 phase with the ultimate goal of advancing knowledge regarding the human virome and its role in cardiovascular, pulmonary and hematological health, resilience, and diseases. Although preliminary data are not required for a R61/R33 application, they may be included. The R61 phase provides time for necessary preliminary work, such as the feasibility of the proposed study, including necessary modification of approaches, methods, or technology.\n\nThis FOA is intended to support a 3-year R33 phase that expands upon the developmental/exploratory work of the R61 phase with the aim to identify and evaluate the basic molecular and physiological mechanisms that underlie how the virome may be influencing HLB health and disease. Funding for the R33 phase is contingent on successfully meeting the proposed milestones set forth in the R61 phase (see Section VI. Award Administration Information for further information). Not all R61 applications are expected to transition to the R33 phase.\n\nNIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made in response to this FOA.\n\nThe following types of Higher Education Institutions are always encouraged to apply for NIH support as Public or Private Institutions of Higher Education:\n\nNonprofits Other Than Institutions of Higher Education\n• Nonprofits with 501(c)(3) IRS Status (Other than Institutions of Higher Education)\n• Nonprofits without 501(c)(3) IRS Status (Other than Institutions of Higher Education)\n\nNon-domestic (non-U.S.) Entities (Foreign Institutions) are not eligible to apply.\n\n Non-domestic (non-U.S.) components of U.S. Organizations are eligible to apply.\n\n Foreign components, as defined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement, are allowed.\n\nApplicant organizations must complete and maintain the following registrations as described in the SF 424 (R&R) Application Guide to be eligible to apply for or receive an award.

As part of the NIH mission, all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\n\nFor this particular announcement, note the following:\n\nThe R61/R33 phased innovation grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new interventions, model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or behavioral and social sciences research. An R61/R33 grant application need not have preliminary data, extensive background material or preliminary information; however, they may be included if available. Appropriate justification for the proposed work can be provided through literature citations, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data. Accordingly, reviewers will focus their evaluation on the conceptual framework, the level of innovation, and the potential to significantly advance our knowledge or understanding. Reviewers will assign a single impact score for the entire application, which includes both the R61 and R33 phases.\n\nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).\n\nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.\n\nDoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?\n\nSpecific to this FOA: How strong is the likelihood that the proposed R61 phase will be hypothesis-generating and lead to important information regarding the influence of the virome on heart, lung and blood health and resilience? What is the likelihood that the research proposed for the R33 phase will advance understanding of the role of the virome in heart, lung, and blood health and resilience?\n\nAre the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project?\n\nDoes the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed?\n\nSpecific to this FOA: Once the R61 milestones are achieved, how clearly are the development and expansion of the R33 phase described?\n\nAre the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented?

T1D affects nearly 2 million individuals in the United States, often beginning in childhood or adolescence with a progressive clinical trajectory. Managing T1D (e.g., pharmacotherapy, nutrition, exercise) is a notable medical challenge, with approximately 20% of youths and adults achieving targets for glycemic control. Untreated or poorly managed T1D results in chronic metabolic dysregulation and potential development of cardiovascular complications, as well as other negative renal and/or neurological conditions. Improving the management of T1D is imperative, particularly given the increasing incidence of T1D, related healthcare costs, and attributable morbidity and mortality. Research is needed to delineate specific factors (e.g., behavioral, physiological) that directly contribute to T1D pathobiology, disease course, and treatment response to identify novel intervention targets to improve the effectiveness of T1D management. Sleep deficiency, which includes insufficient sleep duration, poor sleep quality, irregular sleep timing, and sleep disorders (e.g., insomnia, sleep disordered breathing), is prevalent in individuals with T1D across all ages. This population encounters unique barriers to obtaining sufficient sleep due to pre-existing sleep problems, those that arise as a consequence of metabolic dysregulation, and/or side effects from T1D treatment. Sleep disruption is related to glycemic control in both children and adults, including insulin sensitivity and variability in HbA1c levels. Reduced slow-wave sleep is associated with poorer diabetes self-management, glycemic control, and quality of life outcomes, and more daytime sleepiness in youth with T1D. Surprisingly, the incidence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is higher in individuals with T1D compared to weight match controls, and adults with T1D and moderate-to-severe OSA have poorer glycemic control. Fear of hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia may contribute to disrupted sleep and cardiovascular risk. Asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia is associated with increased arrhythmias and is a relatively common phenomenon in adults with T1D. In the general population, sleep deficiency is associated with an increased risk of various metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, including obesity, hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, and stroke. Sleep and circadian rhythms mediate fundamental processes underlying cardiometabolic function, including glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin production and sensitivity, cellular re-dox, systemic inflammation and immune response, HPA and autonomic balance, cellular stress, autophagy, and cytotoxicity. Taken together, evidence indicates that sleep deficiency may be an important component of T1D, contributing to exacerbated disease severity, accelerated disease progression, increased variability in treatment response, and/or greater associated risk of cardiovascular disease. While previous research has focused predominantly on obesity, T2D, and cardiovascular conditions, the biological plausibility of a direct interface between sleep deficiency and T1D presents an immediate research opportunity. Sleep and circadian rhythms are multi-component phenotypes, and research is needed to identify the specific sleep and circadian perturbations that are most pertinent to T1D pathobiology and management. The bi-directional and mechanistic connections between sleep and T1D remain to be delineated and will be important in determining whether sleep and circadian rhythms are plausible, mechanism-based intervention targets for improving T1D management and outcomes, as well as mitigating associated cardiovascular pathobiology and disease. This NOFO aims to catalyze mechanistic human subjects research to (1) elucidate mechanisms underlying the interactions between sleep, glycemic control, and associated cardiovascular disease pathophysiology in individuals living with T1D; (2) identify sleep and/or circadian alterations in T1D that contribute to variability in disease trajectory and treatment response; (3) determine mechanisms by which T1D triggers alterations in sleep and/or circadian regulation; (4) examine if sleep and/or circadian interventions directly affect physiological, molecular, genetic and/or pharmacological mechanisms central to T1D pathobiology, disease progression, treatment response and related cardiovascular disease. This NOFO supports clinical mechanistic research applying behavioral, physiological, pharmacological, or other strategies to address the aims indicated above. Research studies must include the active participation of individuals living with T1D. Clinical trials focused on mechanisms of action of how a sleep and/or circadian intervention mediates T1D and/or cardiovascular pathophysiology, intermediate markers and/or endpoints are responsive. Human sleep and circadian rhythms are modifiable (e.g., by sleep restriction or extension; through strategies to align circadian rhythms, such as bright light exposure or time restricted eating; treating sleep and/or circadian disorders), presenting an immediate opportunity to examine how perturbations or improvements in sleep and circadian rhythms trigger mechanisms involved in T1D and cardiovascular pathophysiology and treatment response. Furthermore, studies to examine mechanisms by which T1D or T1D treatment reciprocally impacts sleep and circadian regulation are of interest. Research that is not human subjects, mechanistic in focus (e.g., observational, epidemiological, efficacy trials, animal studies) and that do not include individuals living with T1D will be considered non-responsive to this NOFO and will not proceed to review. This initiative will promote research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking sleep deficiency, circadian rhythm disturbances and/or sleep disorders with T1D. Research addressed in response to this initiative could include, but is not limited to, the following:\n• Elucidating the underlying mechanisms by which sleep deficiency and/or sleep-disordered breathing contributes to cardiometabolic dysregulation in individuals with T1D.\n• Determining how sleep and/or circadian variability triggers variability in mechanisms of glycemic control and/or cardiovascular function in adolescents or adults with T1D.\n• Identifying mechanisms underlying specific sleep and/or circadian disturbances in individuals living with T1D, i.e., better understand how T1D results in sleep and/or circadian dysregulation.\n• Examining physiological and molecular/cellular mechanisms by which late or early chronotype impacts insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular risk in people with T1D.\n• Determining the role of circadian misalignment in the melatonin-insulin interaction in people with T1D.\n• Exploring mechanisms underlying the increased incidence of OSA in normal weight adults with T1D.\n• Investigating the effect of sleep and/or circadian rhythms on immune and/or hormonal mechanisms impacting T1D progression and severity and related cardiovascular disease in youth and/or adults with T1D.\n• Elucidating the effects of sleep deficiency or sleep-disordered breathing occurring during critical phases of early development and the contribution these make to the development of T1D in pediatric populations.\n• Investigating mechanisms (i.e., behavioral, physiological, molecular) by which specific disturbances in sleep and/or circadian rhythms affect metabolic and/or cardiovascular treatment responses (e.g., pharmacological, nutrition, exercise) in individuals with T1D.\n• Investigating mechanisms (i.e., behavioral, physiological, pharmacological, molecular) by which specific improvements in sleep and/or circadian rhythms may mitigate metabolic and/or cardiovascular pathobiology and treatment responses in individuals with T1D, and the underlying mechanisms by which sleep deficiency and/or sleep-disordered breathing contribute to cardiometabolic dysregulation in T1D. Awardees are expected to attend biannual (every 6 months), virtual meetings of study teams to present updates on study progress. Every facet of the United States scientific research enterprise—from basic laboratory research to clinical and translational research to policy formation–requires superior intellect, creativity and a wide range of skill sets and viewpoints. NIHs ability to help ensure that the nation remains a global leader in scientific discovery and innovation is dependent upon a pool of highly talented scientists from diverse backgrounds who will help to further NIH's mission. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences.

Within a year, however, the Franks also imprisoned Svatopluk.[7][8] After the Moravians rebelled against the Franks, Svatopluk was released and led the rebels to victory over the invaders.[9] Although he was obliged to pay tribute to East Francia under the peace treaty concluded at Forchheim (Germany) in 874, he was able to expand his territories outside the Franks' sphere of interest in the following years.[9][10] His forces even invaded the March of Pannonia within East Francia in 882.[10][11]\n\nSvatopluk established a good relationship with the popes, and he and his people were formally taken under the protection of the Holy See in 880.[6][9] Pope Stephen V even addressed him as \"King\" in a letter written in 885.[12] Svatopluk seems to have wanted to appease the German clergy who opposed the conducting of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, and he expelled the disciples of Methodius from Moravia in 886, after their teacher's death.[11][13][14]\n\nSvatopluk's state was a loose assemblage of principalities and also included conquered territories.[15]\n\nNot long after his death Svatopluk's realm of Great Moravia collapsed in the midst of a power struggle between his sons and the intensifying Hungarian raids.[16][17]\n\nSvatopluk, whose empire encompassed parts of the territory of modern Czech Republic (Moravia and Bohemia), Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, has occasionally been presented as a \"Slovak King\" in Slovak literary works since the 18th century, the period of the Slovak national awakening.[18]\n\nThe Annals of Fulda refer to Svatopluk as a nephew of Rastislav, the second known ruler of Great Moravia.[5][19] Svatopluk was most probably born around 840.[6] His father's name was Svetimir, according to the late 12th-century Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a medieval historical work long dismissed as a collection of fact and fiction.[20][21] According to the unproven later Moravian tradition of Tomáš Pešina z Čechorodu (17th century), who fulfilled the family tree of the House of Mojmír, Svatopluk was the son of a certain Bogislav.[22] According to Simon of Kéza his father was Morot, a Prince of Poland who had subdued Bractari[23] and occupied Crișana before retiring to Veszprém.[24]\n\nSvatopluk seems to have risen to power in Great Moravia in the early 860s.[5] The Life of Methodius relates that Svatopluk and his uncle jointly asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael III to send missionaries who were familiar with the Slavic tongue to Moravia.[19][25] Michael III chose two brothers, Cyril and Methodius, who were fluent in the dialect of Slavic spoken in the environs of Thessaloniki (Greece).[26] They arrived in Moravia in 863, and immediately set to work teaching and preaching.[27] Their translation of liturgical texts into Old Church Slavonic was approved by Pope Hadrian II in 867.[28]\n\nBy the time Svatopluk first appeared in a Frankish sources (the Annals of Fulda) in 869, he was ruler of his own \"realm\" (regnum, implying autonomous or semi-autonomous land) within Great Moravia.[5][30] This is generally accepted to be the Duchy of Nitra.[31][32] His court was at \"Rastislav's old city\" (urbs antique Rastizi),[5] which may have been either at Staré Město whose name literally means \"old city\" in Czech, or at Nitra (today in Slovakia), but it has also been identified with Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia).[5][6][33]\n\nSvatopluk's \"realm\" was invaded and plundered in 869 by Bavarian troops led by Carloman, the eldest son of Louis the German, King of East Francia.[30] At the same time Franconian and Alamannian troops attacked Rastislav's territories under the leadership of the same King's youngest son, Charles the Fat.[30] Although the two armies soon returned, Svatopluk entered into clandestine negotiations with Carloman, and agreed to commend himself and his principality to Carloman.[30][34]\n\nHaving learned of this agreement, Rastislav is said to have become furious and set a trap for his nephew, inviting him to a banquet where he intended to have him murdered.[35] Svatopluk, however, was warned of his uncle's plans, took Rastislav prisoner and handed him over to Carloman.[35] Rastislav was sent to Bavaria under guard, while Carloman annexed his realm outright.[35]\n\nAs a reward for capturing Rastislav, Carloman allowed Svatopluk to retain his principality, but the rest of Great Moravia was placed under the control of two Frankish lords, William and Engilschalk.[19][34] Carloman's forces also captured Methodius, whom Pope Hadrian II had earlier appointed Archbishop of Sirmium with jurisdiction over the realms ruled by Rastislav and Svatopluk.[34][37] Early in 871 Carloman also imprisoned Svatopluk on unspecified charges of disloyalty, which may have been connected to the rebellion of Carloman's younger brothers, Louis the Younger and Charles the Bald.[38] Believing that Svatopluk was dead, the Moravians selected another member of their ruling family named Slavomír and made him their ruler.[39]\n\nCarloman soon came to the conclusion that the accusations against Svatopluk were unfounded and released him from prison.[39] In order to bind Svatopluk to his family, Carloman had Svatopluk stand as godfather to his illegitimate grandson.[40] Thus this son of Carloman's son Arnulf received the Moravian name Zwentibold.[40]\n\nSvatopluk also agreed to lead Carloman's armies against Slavomír and the rebellious Moravians.[19][41] However, on his arrival at \"Rastislav's old city\", Svatopluk betrayed the Bavarians and conspired secretly with the rebels.[41] Although he captured the fortress in accordance with Carloman's plan, once he was inside its walls he renounced his loyalty to Carloman, rallied a large Moravian force and launched a devastating surprise attack on the unsuspecting Bavarian army encamped outside.[40] The Moravians took a great number of soldiers hostage, killed the rest and rid Moravia of the Frankish occupation.[40] Carloman's governors, William and Engelschalk, were also both slain, and Svatopluk became the undisputed ruler of Great Moravia.[19]\n\nIn October 871 Louis the German sent Bavarian and Franconian troops against the Bohemians (Czechs).[43][44] During the campaign the Franconians surprised a party of Moravians somewhere near the traps that guarded the narrow approaches to a Bohemian fort.[44] The Moravians were returning to their homeland with the daughter of a Bohemian dux (\"duke\"), presumably to marry an unidentified Moravian magnate.[44] Although the Moravians managed to reach the safety of the fort, they had to abandon 644 fully equipped horses in the narrows.[44] The marriage of a Bohemian leader's daughter to a Moravian magnate implies that Svatopluk was planning to form an alliance with the Bohemians.[43]\n\nLouis the German realized the grave threat posed by Svatopluk[43] and assembled forces for a multipronged expedition with pincer movements advancing on Moravian territory from several directions in 872.[45] One army was sent out \"against the Moravian Slavs\" from Regensburg (Germany) in May, but the Thuringian and Saxon soldiers fled in their first encounter with the enemy.[46][47] The second army, composed of Franconians under Bishop Arn of Würzburg and Abbot Sigihard of Fulda, experienced mixed results: although their forces fought well, the majority of the men were killed, and only a handful of survivors returned to East Francia.[46] Finally a third force, consisting of Bavarians and Carantanians under Carloman's command, laid Moravian territories to waste, put Svatopluk's army to flight and forced it to take refuge in an \"extremely well fortified stronghold\".[48][49] Svatopluk, however, soon assembled a large army and attacked the Bavarians who had been left behind under the command of Bishop Emriacho of Regensburg to guard ships on the bank of the river Danube.[49][50]\n\nIn May 873, Pope John VIII moved energetically to discover the whereabouts of Methodius, who was still being held prisoner in Bavaria.[51] He sent harshly worded letters to Carloman and the Bavarian bishops, and commanded Methodius's immediate reinstatement.[51] The Pope seems also to have brokered a lasting peace between Louis the German and Svatopluk.[52] After his meeting with the Pope at Verona (Italy), Louis the German went to Forchheim where, according to the Annals of Fulda, \"he received the legates of Svatopluk asking for a peace treaty\".[52] The exact terms of their agreement are not known, but it seems to have been a compromise: Svatopluk was forced to make an annual payment of tribute to Louis the German, who agreed to avoid any hostile acts against Great Moravia.[19][53] Thus Methodius, who had in the meantime been allowed to return to Moravia, could continue his work in relatively peaceful conditions for some years.[54][55]\n\nGreat Moravia underwent considerable expansion in the 870s.[13] For instance, the Life of Methodius refers to the capture of \"a very powerful pagan prince settled on the Vistula\" in territory of later Poland, and a letter written around 900 by Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg states that Svatopluk conquered the region of Nitra, which had been thereto inhabited by pagans.[56][57] Modern historiography, however, has tended to question the claims that huge neighboring territories were permanently annexed by Great Moravia.[13] For instance, there is little clear archaeological or written evidence of a permanent extension of Moravian power in Lesser Poland or to the west in Silesia, or in Pannonia, as is suggested in earlier historical works.[13]\n\nSvatopluk's expansionist policy was perhaps so successful because most of Western Europe was in the grip of unusually savage and large-scale Viking raids between 879 and 886.[58] On the other hand, the Life of Methodius directly links Svatopluk's military achievements and Methodius' work.[59] For instance, according to his Life, Methodius promised Svatopluk that if the Prince would celebrate Saint Peter's Day in the Archbishop's church, \"God will soon deliver\" his enemies to him, and \"so it came to pass\".[60][61]\n\nNevertheless, at the court of Svatopluk, who himself professed the Latin Rite, intrigues against Methodius and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic gathered strength.[60][62] Svatopluk sent John of Venice, a known opponent of the Slavic liturgy, to Rome in 879 to achieve a settlement of ecclesiastical differences.[62] In a letter addressed to Methodius in the same year, the Pope sharply rebuked him for using Slavonic in church services.[63] Methodius, however, travelled to Rome in 880, together with a Moravian delegation.[54] Under his influence Pope John VIII changed his mind and in a letter, known for its incipit, Industriae tuae, the Pope repeated that Mass was to be sung in Latin whenever requested, but he also allowed the use of Slavonic liturgy.[64][65] The letter also confirmed the decision taken by the Holy See during Rastislav's reign to create an archdiocese for Great Moravia.[66] Upon Svatopluk's request the Pope promoted a German priest, Wiching, to be Bishop of Nitra, but he added that the new Bishop and all the clerics in Great Moravia were expected to be obedient to Methodius, who remained the head of the church in Svatopluk's realms.[57][65]\n\nAt the time when Charles the Fat became the sole ruler of East Francia in 881, the sons of Wilhelm and Engelschalk, the one-time commanders of the Bavarian forces occupying Moravia in 870–871, began to conspire with various Bavarian magnates in order to eject Arbo, the margrave Louis the German had appointed to command a key part of East Francia's frontier on the Danube.[68][69] Arbo, however, appealed for and received help from both Charles the Fat and Svatopluk, and even handed his son over to the latter as a hostage.[69][70]\n\nUpon Arbo's request, Svatopluk, who remembered \"how much evil he along with his people had suffered\" at the hands of Wilhelm and Engelschalk, attacked their sons.[70] His forces soon captured Engelschalk's second son who was mutilated at Svatopluk's order.[71] Thereafter the remaining sons withdrew from the authority of Charles the Fat and become the men of Carloman's son, Arnulf, who was ruling in Pannonia at that time.[69][72] Learning of this, Svatopluk sent ambassadors to Arnulf, demanding that the sons of Wilhelm and Engelschalk be immediately sent away.[73] Arnulf, however, refused to hand them over, to which Svatopluk responded with further invasions.[69] In addition to the Franks and Moravians, the Bulgarians also entered the conflict by invading Svatopluk's realm.[74] According to a record in the Annals of Salzburg, the region of Vienna (Austria) was also invaded in 881 by Hungarians.[75] They seem to have been hired either by Svatopluk or by Arnulf in order to intervene in their conflict.[76]\n\nThus the \"Willhelminer War\", that was to last until 884, led to the devastation of Pannonia east of the river Rába.[77] Finally, Charles the Fat himself turned up and received Svatopluk as his man at Kaumberg (Germany), receiving promises of peace and fidelity.[69] Svatopluk also promised never to invade Charles the Fat's realm with a hostile force as long as he lived, while Charles the Fat recognized him as a prince of his realm.[78] Peace between Arnulf and Svatopluk, however, was only sealed in the latter part of the following year.[69]\n\nMethodius, who seems to have been in Svatopluk's train at Kaumberg, died in 885.[80] In his last days he had indicated Gorazd, one of his Moravian disciples, as most worthy to succeed him.[12] Gorazd, however, did not or could not immediately submit his candidature for ratification of the Holy See, because Bishop Wiching of Nitra soon hurried to Rome.[12] He persuaded Pope Stephen V that Methodius had ignored Pope John VIII's orders in the matter of Slavonic liturgy, and thus, upon his initiative, the pope prohibited the Slavonic liturgy in Moravia.[12] The pope also sent a letter (Quia te zelo) to Svatopluk, urging him to accept the addition of filioque to the Creed and to give up such peculiar Byzantine practices as fasting on Saturday.[12]\n\nWiching having arrived back from Rome, Svatopluk summoned Gorazd, Clement and Methodius's other disciples to submit to the papal directions.[14] When they refused to do so, Svatopluk gave Wiching a free hand to take action against them.[14] Some of them were first thrown into prison, and soon expelled from Moravia, while others, among them Naum, were sold as slaves.[14] The expulsion of Methodius's disciples from Moravia signaled the end of the Slavonic liturgy in Central Europe.[81] The exiles, however, subsequently found refuge in the First Bulgarian Empire where they were able to carry on their work.[11][82] Saint Clement of Ochrid said:\n\nIn his letter Quia te zelo, the pope addressed Svatopluk as rex Sclavorum (\"king of the Slavs\").[12] Although Svatopluk's royal title was not recognized by the contemporary Annals of Fulda, the chronicler Regino of Prüm also referred to Svatopluk as rex Marahensium Sclavorum (\"king of the Moravian Slavs\") in the early 10th century, which is independent evidence confirming that Svatopluk held the title of king.[84] According to the late 12th-century Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, Svatopluk had been crowned \"king in the Roman fashion on the field of Dalma\" in the presence of a papal legate, cardinals, and bishops.[20]\n\nIn 887 Arnulf, Svatopluk's opponent in the \"Wilhelminer War\", became the king of East Francia.[66][85] They met at Omuntesperch, a locality that has yet not been identified, during the winter of 890.[86] At the meeting Svatopluk transmitted to Arnulf a message from Pope Stephen V, urging the king to invade Italy to protect the Holy See.[87] According to Regino of Prüm, the two monarchs also concluded an agreement, in which Arnulf ceded the ducatus of the Bohemians to Svatopluk.[88]\n\nSometime during 891, according to the Annals of Fulda, Arnulf sent an embassy led by margrave Arbo to Moravia in order to renew the peace.[90] A letter written by the margrave soon announced that the legates were returning from Svatopluk and the Moravians who had agreed \"to give themselves in friendship\".[90] Svatopluk, however, broke his pledges, so Arnulf decided to invade Moravia in 891.[91] First the king met with Braslav, the Slavic dux on the river Sava, then raised an army of Franconians, Bavarians and Alamanni, and also recruited Hungarians to join his campaign.[92] In the late 10th century, Arnulf was accused by Ottonian authors of unleashing the Hungarians on Europe because of his desire to bring down Moravia.[93]\n\nArnulf's invasion started in July 892, but he failed to defeat Svatopluk.[66] The war against Moravia seems to have continued until 894.[95] This was the year of Svatopluk's \"most unlucky death\", according to the Annals of Fulda, which implies that he met his end in some kind of mishap, the sort that occurs in war.[96] The exact circumstances of Svatopluk's death, however, are unknown.[97]\n\nSimon of Kéza recorded that he died in battle near Környe.[23]\n\nFollowing Svatopluk's death, Great Moravia, which had achieved its maximum territorial extension, and exercised its greatest influence in his reign, ceased to be a political factor in Central Europe.[99] Among the conquered peoples, the Czechs were the first to withdraw in 895.[16] Although—at least, according to the testimony of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus—Svatopluk had made a deathbed request to his sons, Mojmir II of Moravia and Svatopluk II, that they remain united, after his death internal disagreements between them were fostered by Arnulf.[100] Finally Moravia collapsed in the first decade of the 10th century due to the invasion of the Hungarians.[100][101]\n\nAccording to Hungarian legends, the Hungarians purchased the country from Svatopluk in a symbolic act of exchange: they sent a white horse with saddler to Svatopluk in return for some earth, water and grass, supposed to represent his country itself.[97] Svatopluk allegedly disavowed this \"contract\" and then drowned in the Danube in flight from the Hungarians.[97] The legend, in fact, seems to merely describe a common pagan rite of concluding alliances which might refer to Svatopluk's alliance with the Hungarians in 894.[97]\n\nHistorian Ryszard Grzesik says that the ruler Menumorut, mentioned in the 13th-century chronicle Gesta Hungarorum was the \"personification\" of Svatopluk I of Moravia.\n\nNevertheless, in 1722 Michael Bencsik, a professor of Hungarian law at the University of Trnava, suggested that the nobility and the whole population of Trencsén county within the Kingdom of Hungary were \"the remnants of Svatopluk who sold his country to the Hungarians, and thus the Slovak people, into eternal serfdom\".[104][105] In response, Ján Baltazár Magin, the Roman Catholic pastor of Dubnica, wrote the oldest known defense of the Slovak nation in 1728.[106] Next another Catholic priest, Juraj Fándly, completed a history in Latin entitled Compendiata historia gentis Slavae (\"A Brief History of the Slovak Nation\") in which he depicted Moravia as a state of Slovaks and Svatopluk as their king.[18][107][108] In 1833 the poet Ján Hollý published a poem entitled Svätopluk, the first of a series of epic poems dealing with the past of the Slovak people.[107][109]\n• Alternative theories of the location of Great MoraviaSvatopluk, Duke of Bohemia - Wikipedia: Duke of Bohemia from 1107 to 1109\n\nSvatopluk the Lion (Czech: Svatopluk Olomoucký; died 21 September 1109) was Duke of Bohemia from 1107 until his assassination in 1109. His rule was overshadowed by the fierce conflict around the Bohemian throne in the 12th century.\n\nA member of the Přemyslid dynasty, he was the son of Prince Otto I of Olomouc and Euphemia, daughter of King Béla I of Hungary.[1] His father was the son of Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia.[2] When Bretislaus died in 1055, the Bohemian ducal dignity first passed to his eldest son, Svatopluk's uncle Spytihněv II, and upon Spytihněv's early death in 1061, it passed to Bretislaus's second son Vratislaus II, according to the patrilineal principle of agnatic seniority.\n\nVratislaus, who had received the title of a Bohemian king by order of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV in 1086, elevated Svatopluk's father Otto (the fourth son of Bretislaus I) to the rank of a prince at Olomouc in Moravia. However, when his father died the next year, young Savatopluk had to yield the inheritance claims raised by Bretislaus's third son, his uncle Conrad I, who took over the rule in the Moravian lands.\n\nSvatopluk himself received the title Prince of Olomouc in 1091, but again had to wait to ascend the Bohemian throne.[3] At the death of Duke Conrad in 1092 after eight months of rule, the Bohemian throne was awarded to Bretislaus II, the son of the late King Vratislaus, according to the rules of agnatic seniority. Nevertheless, the enmity with the Moravian branch of the Přemyslids increased, more so when Duke Bretislaus II appointed his half-brother Bořivoj II ruler of the Moravian lands and made an application to Emperor Henry IV to acknowledge Bořivoj's succession as Bohemian duke, thus precipitating a civil war with the sons of his uncle Conrad I. In 1099, he prevailed when the Emperor had an Imperial charter written out, and after the death of Bretislaus II in 1100, Bořivoj took power.[4]\n\nEmperor Henry IV had to face the fact that his intervention had led to a state of anarchy in Bohemia. When he himself was deposed by his son King Henry V of Germany, Svatopluk took his chance, marched against Duke Bořivoj, and with the support of Bořivoj's younger brother Vladislaus was able to oust him after two years of fighting and intriguing. Henry V summoned Svatopluk, who dared not resist, and retained him captive in order to restore his liensman Bořivoj. Soon, however, he became reconciled to Svatopluk, who pledged allegiance and promised military support in the German king's campaign against King Coloman of Hungary. Savatopluk was released and could return to Bohemia. He made the king godfather of his new son, who was baptised Wenceslaus Henry (Václav Jindřich).\n\nIn 1108, Henry V intervened in Hungary on behalf of King Coloman's younger brother Duke Álmos of Nitra. Keeping his promise, Duke Svatopluk at first joined his expedition, but had to return to Bohemia, where Bořivoj had made an attack with the support of the Polish king Bolesław III Wrymouth, an ally of Coloman. The German king had to abandon the siege of Pressburg and King Coloman of Hungary was free to devastate the Moravian lands. Henry was furious and desired to avenge the Polish intervention that caused his Hungarian fiasco. On behalf of Bolesław's expelled brother Zbigniew, he invaded Poland, again with the support of Svatopluk, who led a Bohemian army across the Sudetes into Silesia to join the German forces at the Battle of Głogów. Here Svatopluk was killed on 21 September 1109 in Henry's tent by a member of the Bohemian Vršovice noble family named John, whose chief Mutina he had decapitated for the support he had given to Bořivoj.[5][6]\n\nBořivoj was not able to succeed Svatopluk; instead the ducal dignity passed to his younger brother Vladislaus.Svatopluk | prince of Moravia | Britannica: … (reigned 846–870) and his nephew Svatopluk (reigned 870–894), extended their territory to include all of Bohemia, the southern part of modern Poland, and the western part of modern Hungary, thereby creating the state of Great Moravia. Rostislav also invited the Byzantine missionaries Cyril and Methodius (who arrived in 863) to…Great Moravia: Svatopluk I and Mojmir II (870-907) Czech Center Museum Houston - A place to celebrate our world's art, music, dance and diverse cultures — The Czech Center Museum Houston is a meeting place for Czech and local culture, a place where artists and professionals, Czech and non-Czech alike, can celebrate art, culture and music.: Despite Rostislav’s death and Svatopluk’s arrest at the hands of the Franks, the Moravians would not idly sit by. The Moravians, assuming that Svatopluk had died, revolted in anger and elected Slavomir, another member of the Mojmir line, as prince. Slavomir had previously been a priest and disciple of Cyril and Methodius prior to his ascension to the throne of Great Moravia. His election, despite this, showcased the commitment the Moravians had to the Moymirid dynasty. Aiming to put down this rebellion and to cause internal dispute, Carloman released Svatopluk with the intent of having him lead an army to defeat the rebelling Moravians and reclaim his authority. However, as soon as the army reached the castle of Valy at Mikulcice, Svatopluk defected to the Moravian’s side and together they defeated the Frankish army. For the next two years Svatopluk, now the ruler of Great Moravia after Slavomir stepped down for him, resisted with the Czechs and Serbs all attempts by the Frankish Empire to conquer their lands. Svatopluk was not arrogant though and realized that he could not remain solely independent forever. In 874 in Forcheim, he made peace with Louis the German and swore allegiance to him in exchange for freedom to do his own dealings. Thus began the reign of Svatopluk the Great (870-894) and the apex of Great Moravia’s power.\n\nNow at peace with the Empire of the Franks and free to do as he wanted, Svatopluk began to make large territorial pushes into all the surrounding areas bordering Great Moravia. In 874-880, Great Moravia attacked and conquered the Vistulans in southern Poland and the eastern parts of Slovakia. In 882, he fought for Frankish Pannonia, though it is unknown if he acquired land in this conflict. In 883, he defeated the Bohemians to his west and with them he took control of Silesia, Lusatia, and likely the Serbians. With this, Great Moravia had reached the peak of its territorial extent.\n\nThroughout it all, Svatopluk made an effort to convert all those he conquered to Christianity, making sure to convert the local princes of the area, as to justify his conquest and rule over them. One of these princes would be the Bohemian prince Premysl Borivoj, who he would place above the other Bohemians as his second-in-command. Of course, despite these efforts, there were still many pagans who lived in Great Moravia. Initially, Methodius was initially the Archbishop of Moravia, which Svatopluk had orchestrated in order to place Great Moravia under the Pope and free it from the authority of the Frankish Empire. Eventually, Svatopluk would align with the Bishop of Nitra, Wiching, and change the liturgy from Old Slavonic to Latin, against the will of Methodius. By 890, the power of the Papacy began to wane and once again Svatopluk had to turn his attention to the Franks. He came to an agreement with King Arnulf in East Francia that his conquest be recognized if he remained loyal to the Franks, but in 892 and 893, King Arnulf sought to dominate Great Moravia through military means. Svatopluk was able to successfully stand his ground against the Franks, but his death in 894 would spell the coming end for Great Moravia.\n\nWhile the threat of external invasion was indeed real to Great Moravia, what truly doomed it was a threat from within. It was soon realized that what had kept this great empire together was not its infrastructure, but the strength of Svatopluk himself. Upon his death, his son Mojmir II (894-906) took his place. The tribes his father had conquered began to break away from Great Moravia despite his best efforts and there were many who supported the claim of Svatopluk II, his younger brother. East Francia was not the only external threat to Great Moravia. In the lands that were once home to the Avars, a new group of nomads had taken up residents: the Magyars. Mojmir II tried to make peace with Arnulf and the Magyars, which at first succeeded.\n\nUnfortunately, with Arnulf’s death in 899, the Magyars took Pannonia and began taking control of the whole region. Mojmir II aligned himself with the Bavarians in a joint effort to defeat the Magyars and in 906 the two forces clashed. The Magyars devastated Great Moravia’s army, slaughtering many magnates in the process. It is said Mojmir II also fell in battle during this confrontation. The Bavarians attempted to recover in 907, but the Magyars struck them down in Bratislava, spelling the end of the Moymirid dynasty and the end of Great Moravia.\n\nThough the Magyar did not take much of Great Moravia’s land, the damage to its political structure caused it to collapse in on itself, accelerated by pagan uprisings from within. With the fall of Great Moravia, the Moravians themselves fell with it, eventually ceasing to exist as an ethnicity. The Moravians that exist today emerged much later and with no direct connection to those of Great Moravia. However, like with Samo’s Empire before, a new state would rise from Great Moravia’s ashes, but this time from the land of the Czechs. Where the Moymirids had failed in Moravia, Premysl Borivoj and his Premyslid descendants would succeed in the Czech lands of Bohemia.

Each mat has video-recording equipment and a 62-inch flat-screen TV for film breakdown. Bleacher seating is available for spectators, while cardio equipment occupies the east and west walls overlooking the mats.\n\nThe Wolverines' locker room features 35 custom-made maple lockers, 10 wall showers, bathroom facilities and an adjoining nutritional juice bar.

It is equipped with three taping tables, treatment area and a separate hydrotherapy room with hot and cold plunge tubs.\n\nHighlighting the facility's second floor, the 3,500-square-foot strength and conditioning area overlooks the mats and includes eight racks, an extensive range of dumbbells, a plyometric area, core stability equipment as well as additional weight and cardio machinery.\n\nVisitors to the facility are greeted by a spacious lobby that features a Hall of Fame showcase and interactive video kiosk. Wrapped in two shades of maple, the lobby provides direct access to the coaches' office suite, team lounge and mat space.\n\nThe facility is named in honor of former Michigan wrestler Ralph Bahna (1962-64) and his wife, Dorothy as the Bahnas provided the lead gift to build the Michigan wrestling center. A three-year letterwinner, Bahna was a member of two Big Ten Championship squads under legendary coach Cliff Keen. He captured the Big Ten 123-pound title as a senior in 1964.

The country is bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast, and Slovakia to the southeast.[15] The Czech Republic has a hilly landscape that covers an area of 78,871 square kilometers (30,452 sq mi) with a mostly temperate continental and oceanic climate. The capital and largest city is Prague; other major cities and urban areas include Brno, Ostrava, Plzeň and Liberec.\n\nThe Duchy of Bohemia was founded in the late 9th century under Great Moravia. It was formally recognized as an Imperial Estate of the Holy Roman Empire in 1002 and became a kingdom in 1198.[16][17] Following the Battle of Mohács in 1526, all of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were gradually integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. Nearly a hundred years later, the Protestant Bohemian Revolt led to the Thirty Years' War. After the Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburgs consolidated their rule. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Crown lands became part of the Austrian Empire.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Czech lands became more industrialized; further, in 1918, most of the country became part of the First Czechoslovak Republic following the collapse of Austria-Hungary after World War I.[18] Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a parliamentary democracy during the entirety of the interwar period.[19] After the Munich Agreement in 1938, Nazi Germany systematically took control over the Czech lands. Czechoslovakia was restored in 1945 and three years later became an Eastern Bloc communist state following a coup d'état in 1948. Attempts to liberalize the government and economy were suppressed by a Soviet-led invasion of the country during the Prague Spring in 1968. In November 1989, the Velvet Revolution ended communist rule in the country and restored democracy. On 31 December 1992, Czechoslovakia was peacefully dissolved, with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\n\nThe Czech Republic is a unitary parliamentary republic and developed country with an advanced, high-income social market economy. It is a welfare state with a European social model, universal health care and free-tuition university education. It ranks 32nd in the Human Development Index. The Czech Republic is a member of the United Nations, NATO, the European Union, the OECD, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the Visegrád Group.\n\nThe traditional English name \"Bohemia\" derives from Latin Boiohaemum, which means \"home of the Boii\" (a Gallic tribe). The current English name ultimately comes from the Czech word Čech.[20][21][22] The name comes from the Slavic tribe (Czech: Češi, Čechové) and, according to legend, their leader Čech, who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on Říp Mountain. The etymology of the word Čech is uncertain, but according to the most common derivation can be traced back to the Proto-Slavic root *čel-, meaning \"member of the people; kinsman\", thus making it cognate to the Czech word člověk (a person).[23][24][25][26]\n\nThe country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely Bohemia (Čechy) in the west, Moravia (Morava) in the east, and Czech Silesia (Slezsko; the smaller, south-eastern part of historical Silesia, most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast.[27] Known as the lands of the Bohemian Crown since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including Czech/Bohemian lands, Bohemian Crown, Czechia,[28] and the lands of the Crown of Saint Wenceslaus. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the new name of Czechoslovakia was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within one country.[29]\n\nAfter Czechoslovakia dissolved on the last day of 1992, Česko was adopted as the Czech short name for the new state and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic recommended Czechia for the English-language equivalent.[30] This form was not widely adopted at the time, leading to the long name Czech Republic being used in English in nearly all circumstances. The Czech government directed use of Czechia as the official English short name in 2016.[31] The short name has been listed by the United Nations[32] and is used by other organizations such as the European Union,[33] NATO,[34] the CIA,[35] Google Maps,[36] and the European Broadcasting Union.[37] In 2022, the American AP Stylebook stated in its entry on the country that \"both [Czechia and the Czech Republic] are acceptable. The shorter name Czechia is preferred by the Czech government. If using Czechia, clarify in the story that the country is more widely known in English as the Czech Republic.\"[38]\n\nArchaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the Paleolithic era.[citation needed]\n\nIn the classical era, as a result of the 3rd century BC Celtic migrations, Bohemia became associated with the Boii.[41] The Boii founded an oppidum near the site of modern Prague.[42] Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the Marcomanni and Quadi settled there.[43]\n\nSlavs from the Black Sea–Carpathian region settled in the area (their migration was pushed by an invasion of peoples from Siberia and Eastern Europe into their area:[44] Huns, Avars, Bulgars and Magyars).[45] In the sixth century, the Huns had moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia, and some of present-day Austria and Germany.[45]\n\nDuring the 7th century, the Frankish merchant Samo, supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled Avars,[46] became the ruler of the first documented Slavic state in Central Europe, Samo's Empire. The principality of Great Moravia, controlled by Moymir dynasty, arose in the 8th century.[47] It reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of Svatopluk I of Moravia), holding off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a role being played by the Byzantine mission of Cyril and Methodius. They codified the Old Church Slavonic language, the first literary and liturgical language of the Slavs, and the Glagolitic script.[48]\n\nThe Duchy of Bohemia emerged in the late 9th century when it was unified by the Přemyslid dynasty. Bohemia was from 1002 until 1806 an Imperial Estate of the Holy Roman Empire.[49]\n\nIn 1212, Přemysl Ottokar I extracted the Golden Bull of Sicily from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a Kingdom.[50] German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century.[51] The Mongols in the invasion of Europe carried their raids into Moravia but were defensively defeated at Olomouc.[52]\n\nAfter a series of dynastic wars, the House of Luxembourg gained the Bohemian throne.[53]\n\nEfforts for a reform of the church in Bohemia started already in the late 14th century. Jan Hus' followers seceded from some practices of the Roman Church and in the Hussite Wars (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by Sigismund. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemia and Moravia were considered Hussites. The pacifist thinker Petr Chelčický inspired the movement of the Moravian Brethren (by the middle of the 15th century) that completely separated from the Roman Catholic Church.[54]\n\nOn 21 December 1421, Jan Žižka, a successful military commander and mercenary, led his group of forces in the Battle of Kutná Hora, resulting in a victory for the Hussites. He is honoured to this day as a national hero.\n\nAfter 1526, Bohemia came increasingly under Habsburg control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. Between 1583 and 1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II and his court.\n\nThe Defenestration of Prague and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the Thirty Years' War. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the Battle of White Mountain and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The leaders of the Bohemian Revolt were executed in 1621. The nobility and the middle class Protestants had to either convert to Catholicism or leave the country.[55]\n\nThe following era of 1620 to the late 18th century became known as the \"Dark Age\". During the Thirty Years' War, the population of the Czech lands declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and famine.[56] The Habsburgs prohibited all Christian confessions other than Catholicism.[57] The flowering of Baroque culture shows the ambiguity of this historical period. Ottoman Turks and Tatars invaded Moravia in 1663.[58] In 1679–1680 the Czech lands faced the Great Plague of Vienna and an uprising of serfs.[59]\n\nThere were peasant uprisings influenced by famine.[60] Serfdom was abolished between 1781 and 1848. Several battles of the Napoleonic Wars took place on the current territory of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of Bohemia which lost its position of an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire as well as its own political representation in the Imperial Diet.[61] Bohemian lands became part of the Austrian Empire. During the 18th and 19th century the Czech National Revival began its rise, with the purpose to revive Czech language, culture, and national identity. The Revolution of 1848 in Prague, striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the Bohemian Crown within the Austrian Empire, was suppressed.[62]\n\nIt seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end, the Emperor Franz Joseph I affected a compromise with Hungary only. The Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a disappointment of some Czech politicians.[62] The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called Cisleithania.\n\nThe Czech Social Democratic and progressive politicians started the fight for universal suffrage. The first elections under universal male suffrage were held in 1907.[63]\n\nIn 1918, during the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy at the end of World War I, the independent republic of Czechoslovakia, which joined the winning Allied powers, was created, with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk in the lead.[65] This new country incorporated the Bohemian Crown.[66]\n\nThe First Czechoslovak Republic comprised only 27% of the population of the former Austria-Hungary, but nearly 80% of the industry, which enabled it to compete with Western industrial states.[64] In 1929 compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938 Czechoslovakia held 10th place in the world industrial production.[67] Czechoslovakia was the only country in Central and Eastern Europe to remain a liberal democracy throughout the entire interwar period.[68] Although the First Czechoslovak Republic was a unitary state, it provided certain rights to its minorities, the largest being Germans (23.6% in 1921), Hungarians (5.6%) and Ukrainians (3.5%).[69]\n\nWestern Czechoslovakia was occupied by Nazi Germany, which placed most of the region into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The Protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinated to Nazi Germany's Reichsprotektor. One Nazi concentration camp was located within the Czech territory at Terezín, north of Prague. The vast majority of the Protectorate's Jews were murdered in Nazi-run concentration camps. The Nazi Generalplan Ost called for the extermination, expulsion, Germanization or enslavement of most or all Czechs for the purpose of providing more living space for the German people.[70] There was Czechoslovak resistance to Nazi occupation as well as reprisals against the Czechoslovaks for their anti-Nazi resistance. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the Prague uprising.[71] Most of Czechoslovakia's German-speakers were forcibly expelled from the country, first as a result of local acts of violence and then under the aegis of an \"organized transfer\" confirmed by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain at the Potsdam Conference.[72]\n\nIn the 1946 elections, the Communist Party gained 38%[73] of the votes and became the largest party in the Czechoslovak parliament, formed a coalition with other parties, and consolidated power. A coup d'état came in 1948 and a single-party government was formed. For the next 41 years, the Czechoslovak Communist state conformed to Eastern Bloc economic and political features.[74] The Prague Spring political liberalization was stopped by the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Analysts believe that the invasion caused the communist movement to fracture, ultimately leading to the Revolutions of 1989.\n\nIn November 1989, Czechoslovakia again became a liberal democracy through the Velvet Revolution. However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened (Hyphen War) and on 31 December 1992, the country peacefully split into the independent countries of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both countries went through economic reforms and privatizations, with the intention of creating a market economy, as they have been trying to do since 1990, when Czechs and Slovaks still shared the common state. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognized by the World Bank as a \"developed country\",[75] and in 2009 the Human Development Index ranked it as a nation of \"Very High Human Development\".[76]\n\nFrom 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the Visegrád Group and from 1995, the OECD. The Czech Republic joined NATO on 12 March 1999 and the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the Schengen Area.[77]\n\nUntil 2017, either the centre-left Czech Social Democratic Party or the centre-right Civic Democratic Party led the governments of the Czech Republic. In October 2017, the populist movement ANO 2011, led by the country's second-richest man, Andrej Babiš, won the elections with three times more votes than its closest rival, the Civic Democrats.[78] In December 2017, Czech president Miloš Zeman appointed Andrej Babiš as the new prime minister.[79]\n\nIn the 2021 elections, ANO 2011 was narrowly defeated and Petr Fiala became the new prime minister.[80] He formed a government coalition of the alliance SPOLU (Civic Democratic Party, KDU-ČSL and TOP 09) and the alliance of Pirates and Mayors. In January 2023, retired general Petr Pavel won the presidential election, becoming new Czech president to succeed Miloš Zeman.[81] Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the country took in half a million Ukrainian refugees, the largest number per capita in the world.[82][83]\n\nThe Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes 48° and 51° N and longitudes 12° and 19° E.\n\nBohemia, to the west, consists of a basin drained by the Elbe (Czech: Labe) and the Vltava rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the Krkonoše range of the Sudetes. The highest point in the country, Sněžka at 1,603 m (5,259 ft), is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also hilly. It is drained mainly by the Morava River, but it also contains the source of the Oder River (Czech: Odra).\n\nWater from the Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the North Sea, Baltic Sea, and Black Sea. The Czech Republic also leases the Moldauhafen, a 30,000-square-meter (7.4-acre) lot in the middle of the Hamburg Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the Treaty of Versailles, to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.\n\nPhytogeographically, the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the Circumboreal Region, within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Western European broadleaf forests, Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.[84]\n\nThere are four national parks in the Czech Republic. The oldest is Krkonoše National Park (Biosphere Reserve), and the others are Šumava National Park (Biosphere Reserve), Podyjí National Park, and Bohemian Switzerland.\n\nThe three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly some countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond with the river basins of the Elbe and the Vltava basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).\n\nThe Czech Republic has a temperate climate, situated in the transition zone between the oceanic and continental climate types, with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is due to the landlocked geographical position.[85]\n\nTemperatures vary depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and precipitation increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around Bílý Potok in Jizera Mountains and the driest region is the Louny District to the northwest of Prague. Another factor is the distribution of the mountains.\n\nAt the highest peak of Sněžka (1,603 m or 5,259 ft), the average temperature is −0.4 °C (31 °F), whereas in the lowlands of the South Moravian Region, the average temperature is as high as 10 °C (50 °F). The country's capital, Prague, has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.\n\nThe coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is snow in the mountains and sometimes in the cities and lowlands. During March, April, and May, the temperature usually increases, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary during the day. Spring is also characterized by higher water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.\n\nThe warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about 20–30 °C (36–54 °F) higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.\n\nAutumn generally begins in September, which is still warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below 15 °C (59 °F) or 10 °C (50 °F) and deciduous trees begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.\n\nThe coldest temperature ever measured was in Litvínovice near České Budějovice in 1929, at −42.2 °C (−44.0 °F) and the hottest measured, was at 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) in Dobřichovice in 2012.[86]\n\nMost rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1 mm (0.0039 in) of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated rainfall (days with more than 10 mm (0.39 in) per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).[87] Severe thunderstorms, producing damaging straight-line winds, hail, and occasional tornadoes occur, especially during the summer period.[88][89]\n\nAs of 2020, the Czech Republic ranks as the 21st most environmentally conscious country in the world in Environmental Performance Index.[90] It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.71/10, ranking it 160th globally out of 172 countries.[91] The Czech Republic has four National Parks (Šumava National Park, Krkonoše National Park, České Švýcarsko National Park, Podyjí National Park) and 25 Protected Landscape Areas. The fauna of the Czech Republic includes a wide variety of animal species. Some species (especially endangered ones) are bred in reserves. Among the rare animals are, for example, eagles, ospreys, bustards, and storks.[92]\n\nThe Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party parliamentary representative democracy. The Parliament (Parlament České republiky) is bicameral, with the Chamber of Deputies (Czech: Poslanecká sněmovna, 200 members) and the Senate (Czech: Senát, 81 members).[93] The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term by proportional representation, with a 5% election threshold. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the Czech National Council, has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia. The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat constituencies by two-round runoff voting for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. This arrangement is modeled on the U.S. Senate, but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff.\n\nThe president is a formal head of state with limited and specific powers, who appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 1993 until 2012, the President of the Czech Republic was selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms (Václav Havel and Václav Klaus were both elected twice). Since 2013, the president has been elected directly.[94] Some commentators have argued that, with the introduction of direct election of the President, the Czech Republic has moved away from the parliamentary system and towards a semi-presidential one.[95] The Government's exercise of executive power derives from the Constitution. The members of the government are the Prime Minister, Deputy prime ministers and other ministers. The Government is responsible to the Chamber of Deputies.[96] The Prime Minister is the head of government and wields powers such as the right to set the agenda for most foreign and domestic policy and choose government ministers.[97]\n\nThe Czech Republic is a unitary state,[98] with a civil law system based on the continental type, rooted in Germanic legal culture. The basis of the legal system is the Constitution of the Czech Republic adopted in 1993.[99] The Penal Code is effective from 2010. A new Civil code became effective in 2014. The court system includes district, county, and supreme courts and is divided into civil, criminal, and administrative branches. The Czech judiciary has a triumvirate of supreme courts. The Constitutional Court consists of 15 constitutional judges and oversees violations of the Constitution by either the legislature or by the government.[99] The Supreme Court is formed of 67 judges and is the court of highest appeal for most legal cases heard in the Czech Republic. The Supreme Administrative Court decides on issues of procedural and administrative propriety. It also has jurisdiction over certain political matters, such as the formation and closure of political parties, jurisdictional boundaries between government entities, and the eligibility of persons to stand for public office.[99] The Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court are both based in Brno, as is the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office.[99]\n\nThe Czech Republic has ranked as one of the safest or most peaceful countries for the past few decades.[100] It is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, NATO, OECD, Council of Europe and is an observer to the Organization of American States.[101] The embassies of most countries with diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic are located in Prague, while consulates are located across the country.\n\nThe Czech passport is restricted by visas. According to the 2018 Henley & Partners Visa Restrictions Index, Czech citizens have visa-free access to 173 countries, which ranks them 7th along with Malta and New Zealand.[102] The World Tourism Organization ranks the Czech passport 24th.[103] The US Visa Waiver Program applies to Czech nationals.\n\nThe Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs have primary roles in setting foreign policy, although the President also has influence and represents the country abroad. Membership in the European Union and NATO is central to the Czech Republic's foreign policy. The Office for Foreign Relations and Information (ÚZSI) serves as the foreign intelligence agency responsible for espionage and foreign policy briefings, as well as protection of Czech Republic's embassies abroad.\n\nThe Czech Republic has ties with Slovakia, Poland and Hungary as a member of the Visegrád Group,[104] as well as with Germany,[105] Israel,[106] the United States[107] and the European Union and its members. After 2020, relations with Asian democratic states, such as Taiwan, are being strengthened.[108] Conversely, the Czech Republic has long had bad relations with Russia; from 2021, the Czech Republic appears on Russia's official list of enemy countries.[109] The Czech Republic also has problematic relations with China.\n\nCzech officials have supported dissenters in Belarus, Moldova, Myanmar and Cuba.[110]\n\nFamous Czech diplomats of the past included Jaroslav Lev of Rožmitál, Humprecht Jan Czernin, Count Philip Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau, Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg, Prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg, Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal, Ottokar Czernin, Edvard Beneš, Jan Masaryk, Jiří Hájek, Jiří Dienstbier, Michael Žantovský, Petr Kolář, Alexandr Vondra, Prince Karel Schwarzenberg and Petr Pavel.\n\nThe Czech armed forces consist of the Czech Land Forces, the Czech Air Force and of specialized support units. The armed forces are managed by the Ministry of Defence. The President of the Czech Republic is Commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In 2004 the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The country has been a member of NATO since 12 March 1999. Defence spending is approximately 1.28% of the GDP (2021).[111] The armed forces are charged with protecting the Czech Republic and its allies, promoting global security interests, and contributing to NATO.\n\nCurrently, as a member of NATO, the Czech military are participating in the Resolute Support and KFOR operations and have soldiers in Afghanistan, Mali, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Egypt, Israel and Somalia. The Czech Air Force also served in the Baltic states and Iceland.[112] The main equipment of the Czech military includes JAS 39 Gripen multi-role fighters, Aero L-159 Alca combat aircraft, AH-1Z Viper attack helicopters, armored vehicles (Pandur II, BVP-2) and tanks (T-72M4CZ and Leopard 2A4).\n\nHuman rights in the Czech Republic are guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and international treaties on human rights. Nevertheless, there were cases of human rights violations such as discrimination against Roma children,[113] for which the European Commission asked the Czech Republic to provide an explanation,[114] or the illegal sterilization of Roma women,[115] for which the government apologized.[116]\n\nPeople of the same sex can enter into a \"registered partnership\" in the Czech Republic. Conducting same-sex marriage is not legal under current Czech law.[117]\n\nSince 2000, the Czech Republic has been divided into thirteen regions (Czech: kraje, singular kraj) and the capital city of Prague. Every region has its own elected regional assembly and a regional governor. In Prague, the assembly and presidential powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.\n\nThe older seventy-six districts (okresy, singular okres) including three \"statutory cities\" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.[118]\n\nThe smallest administrative units are obce (municipalities). As of 2021, the Czech Republic is divided into 6,254 municipalities. Cities and towns are also municipalities. The capital city of Prague is a region and municipality at the same time.\n\nThe Czech Republic has a developed,[119] high-income[120] export-oriented social market economy based in services, manufacturing and innovation, that maintains a welfare state and the European social model.[121] The Czech Republic participates in the European Single Market as a member of the European Union and is therefore a part of the economy of the European Union, but uses its own currency, the Czech koruna, instead of the euro. It has a per capita GDP rate that is 91% of the EU average[122] and is a member of the OECD. Monetary policy is conducted by the Czech National Bank, whose independence is guaranteed by the Constitution. The Czech Republic ranks 12th in the UN inequality-adjusted human development and 24th in World Bank Human Capital Index. It was described by The Guardian as \"one of Europe's most flourishing economies\".[123]\n\nAs of 2023 , the country's GDP per capita at purchasing power parity is $51,329[124] and $29,856 at nominal value.[125] According to Allianz A.G., in 2018 the country was an MWC (mean wealth country), ranking 26th in net financial assets.[126] The country experienced a 4.5% GDP growth in 2017.[127] The 2016 unemployment rate was the lowest in the EU at 2.4%,[128] and the 2016 poverty rate was the second lowest of OECD members.[129] Czech Republic ranks 27th in the 2021 Index of Economic Freedom,[130] 30th in the 2024 Global Innovation Index,[131] 29th in the Global Competitiveness Report,[132] and 25th in the Global Enabling Trade Report.[133] The Czech Republic has a diverse economy that ranks 7th in the 2016 Economic Complexity Index.[134] The industrial sector accounts for 37.5% of the economy, while services account for 60% and agriculture for 2.5%.[135] The largest trading partner for both export and import is Germany and the EU in general. Dividends worth CZK 270 billion were paid to the foreign owners of Czech companies in 2017, which has become a political issue.[136] The country has been a member of the Schengen Area since 1 May 2004, having abolished border controls, completely opening its borders with all of its neighbors on 21 December 2007.[137]\n\nIn 2018 the largest companies by revenue in the Czech Republic were: automobile manufacturer Škoda Auto, utility company ČEZ Group, conglomerate Agrofert, energy trading company EPH, oil processing company Unipetrol, electronics manufacturer Foxconn CZ and steel producer Moravia Steel.[138] Other Czech transportation companies include: Škoda Transportation (tramways, trolleybuses, metro), Tatra (heavy trucks, the second oldest car maker in the world), Avia (medium trucks), Karosa and SOR Libchavy (buses), Aero Vodochody (military aircraft), Let Kunovice (civil aircraft), Zetor (tractors), Jawa Moto (motorcycles) and Čezeta (electric scooters).\n\nŠkoda Transportation is the fourth largest tram producer in the world; nearly one third of all trams in the world come from Czech factories.[139] The Czech Republic is also the world's largest vinyl records manufacturer, with GZ Media producing about 6 million pieces annually in Loděnice.[140] Česká zbrojovka is among the ten largest firearms producers in the world and five who produce automatic weapons.[141]\n\nIn the food industry, Czech companies include Agrofert, Kofola and Hamé.\n\nProduction of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 TWh per year, the excess being exported. Nuclear power presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by nuclear plants; and 4.6 percent came from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is Temelín Nuclear Power Station, with another nuclear power plant in Dukovany.\n\nThe Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade brown coal as a source of energy. Natural gas is purchased from Norwegian companies and as liquefied gas LNG from the Netherlands and Belgium. In the past, three-quarters of gas supplies came from Russia, but after the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government gradually stopped these supplies.[142] Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption. South Moravia has small oil and gas deposits.\n\nAs of 2020, the road network in the Czech Republic is 55,768.3 kilometers (34,652.82 mi) long, out of which 1,276.4 km (793.1 mi) are motorways.[143] The speed limit is 50 km/h (31 mph) within towns, 90 km/h (56 mph) outside of towns and 130 km/h (81 mph) on motorways.[144]\n\nThe Czech Republic has one of the densest rail networks in the world. As of 2020, the country has 9,542 kilometers (5,929 mi) of lines. Of that number, 3,236 km (2,011 mi) is electrified, 7,503 km (4,662 mi) are single-line tracks and 2,040 km (1,270 mi) are double and multiple-line tracks.[145] The length of tracks is 15,360 km (9,540 mi), out of which 6,917 km (4,298 mi) is electrified.[146]\n\nČeské dráhy (the Czech Railways) is the main railway operator in the country, with about 180 million passengers carried yearly. Maximum speed is limited to 160 km/h (99 mph).\n\nVáclav Havel Airport in Prague is the main international airport in the country. In 2019, it handled 17.8 million passengers.[147] In total, the Czech Republic has 91 airports, six of which provide international air services. The public international airports are in Brno, Karlovy Vary, Mnichovo Hradiště, Mošnov (near Ostrava), Pardubice and Prague.[148] The non-public international airports capable of handling airliners are in Kunovice and Vodochody.[149]\n\nRussia (via pipelines through Ukraine) and, to a lesser extent, Norway (via pipelines through Germany) supply the Czech Republic with liquid and natural gas.[150]\n\nThe Czech Republic ranks in the top 10 countries worldwide with the fastest average internet speed.[151] By the beginning of 2008, there were over 800 mostly local WISPs,[152][153] with about 350,000 subscribers in 2007. Plans based on either GPRS, EDGE, UMTS or CDMA2000 are being offered by all three mobile phone operators (T-Mobile, O2, Vodafone) and internet provider U:fon. Government-owned Český Telecom slowed down broadband penetration. At the beginning of 2004, local-loop unbundling began and alternative operators started to offer ADSL and also SDSL. This and later privatization of Český Telecom helped drive down prices.\n\nOn 1 July 2006, Český Telecom was acquired by globalized company (Spain-owned) Telefónica group and adopted the new name Telefónica O2 Czech Republic. As of 2017 , VDSL and ADSL2+ are offered in variants, with download speeds of up to 50 Mbit/s and upload speeds of up to 5 Mbit/s. Cable internet is gaining more popularity with its higher download speeds ranging from 50 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.\n\nTwo computer security companies, Avast and AVG, were founded in the Czech Republic. In 2016, Avast led by Pavel Baudiš bought rival AVG for US$1.3 billion, together at the time, these companies had a user base of about 400 million people and 40% of the consumer market outside of China.[154][155] Avast is the leading provider of antivirus software, with a 20.5% market share.[156]\n\nPrague is the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome.[157] In 2001, the total earnings from tourism reached 118 billion CZK, making up 5.5% of the country's GNP and 9% of its overall export earnings. The industry employs more than 110,000 people – over 1% of the population.[158] Guidebooks and tourists reporting overcharging by taxi drivers and pickpocketing problems talk mainly about Prague, though the situation has improved recently.[159][160] Since 2005, Prague's mayor, Pavel Bém, has worked to improve this reputation by cracking down on petty crime[160] and, aside from these problems, Prague is a \"safe\" city.[161] The Czech Republic's crime rate is described by the United States State department as \"low\".[162]\n\nThe Czech Republic boasts 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 3 of them being transnational. As of 2024 , further 13 sites are on the tentative list.[163]\n\nArchitectural heritage is an object of interest to visitors – it includes castles and châteaux from different historical epochs, namely Karlštejn Castle, Český Krumlov and the Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape. There are 12 cathedrals and 15 churches elevated to the rank of basilica by the Pope, as well as many monasteries.\n\nAway from the towns, areas such as Bohemian Paradise, Bohemian Forest and the Giant Mountains attract visitors seeking outdoor pursuits.\n\nThe country is also known for its various museums, puppetry and marionette exhibitions that take part within larger puppet festivals, and beer festivals.[164] Aquapalace Prague in Čestlice is the largest water park in the country.\n\nThe Czech lands have a long and well-documented history of scientific innovation.[165][166] Today, the Czech Republic has a highly sophisticated, developed, high-performing, innovation-oriented scientific community supported by the government,[167] industry,[168] and leading universities.[169] Czech scientists are embedded members of the global scientific community.[170] They contribute annually to multiple international academic journals and collaborate with their colleagues across boundaries and fields.[171][172][173][174] The Czech Republic was ranked 24th in the Global Innovation Index in 2020 and 2021, up from 26th in 2019.[175][176][177]\n\nHistorically, the Czech lands, especially Prague, have been the seat of scientific discovery going back to early modern times, including Tycho Brahe, Nicolaus Copernicus, and Johannes Kepler. In 1784 the scientific community was first formally organized under the charter of the Royal Czech Society of Sciences. Currently, this organization is known as the Czech Academy of Sciences.[178] Similarly, the Czech lands have a well-established history of scientists,[179][180] including Nobel laureates biochemists Gerty and Carl Ferdinand Cori, chemists Jaroslav Heyrovský and Otto Wichterle, physicists Ernst Mach and Peter Grünberg, physiologist Jan Evangelista Purkyně and chemist Antonín Holý.[181] Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, was born in Příbor,[182] Gregor Mendel, the founder of genetics, was born in Hynčice and spent most of his life in Brno,[183] logician and mathematician Kurt Gödel was born in Brno.\n\nHistorically, most scientific research was recorded in Latin, but from the 18th century onwards increasingly in German and later in Czech, archived in libraries supported and managed by religious groups and other denominations as evidenced by historical locations of international renown and heritage such as the Strahov Monastery and the Clementinum in Prague. Increasingly, Czech scientists publish their work and that of their history in English.[184][185]\n\nThe current important scientific institution is the already mentioned Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the CEITEC Institute in Brno or the HiLASE and Eli Beamlines centers with the most powerful laser in the world in Dolní Břežany. Prague is the seat of the administrative center of the GSA Agency operating the European navigation system Galileo and the European Union Agency for the Space Programme.\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) in 2020 was estimated at 1.71 children per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.[186] The Czech Republic's population has an average age of 43.3 years.[187] The life expectancy in 2021 was estimated to be 79.5 years (76.55 years male, 82.61 years female).[188] About 77,000 people immigrate to the Czech Republic annually.[189] Vietnamese immigrants began settling in the country during the Communist period, when they were invited as guest workers by the Czechoslovak government.[190] In 2009, there were about 70,000 Vietnamese in the Czech Republic.[191] Most decide to stay in the country permanently.[192]\n\nAccording to results of the 2021 census, the majority of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic are Czechs (57.3%), followed by Moravians (3.4%), Slovaks (0.9%), Ukrainians (0.7%), Viets (0.3%), Poles (0.3%), Russians (0.2%), Silesians (0.1%) and Germans (0.1%). Another 4.0% declared combination of two nationalities (3.6% combination of Czech and other nationality). As the 'nationality' was an optional item, a number of people left this field blank (31.6%).[4] According to some estimates, there are about 250,000 Romani people in the Czech Republic.[193][194] The Polish minority resides mainly in the Trans-Olza region.[195]\n\nThere were 658,564 foreigners residing in the country in 2021,[196] according to the Czech Statistical Office, with the largest groups being Ukrainian (22%), Slovak (22%), Vietnamese (12%), Russian (7%) and German (4%). Most of the foreign population lives in Prague (37.3%) and Central Bohemia Region (13.2%).[197]\n\nThe Jewish population of Bohemia and Moravia, 118,000 according to the 1930 census, was nearly annihilated by the Nazi Germans during the Holocaust.[198] There were approximately 3,900 Jews in the Czech Republic in 2021.[199] The former Czech prime minister, Jan Fischer, is of Jewish faith.[200]\n\nNationality of residents, who answered the question in the Census 2021:[201][202]\n\nAbout 75%[205] to 79%[206] of residents of the Czech Republic do not declare having any religion or faith in surveys, and the proportion of convinced atheists (30%) is the third highest in the world behind those of China (47%) and Japan (31%).[207][unreliable source?] The Czech people have been historically characterized as \"tolerant and even indifferent towards religion\".[208] The religious identity of the country has changed drastically since the first half of the 20th century, when more than 90% of Czechs were Christians.[209]\n\nChristianization in the 9th and 10th centuries introduced Christianity. After the Bohemian Reformation, most Czechs became followers of Jan Hus, Petr Chelčický and other regional Protestant Reformers. Taborites and Utraquists were Hussite groups. Towards the end of the Hussite Wars, the Utraquists changed sides and allied with the Roman Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist—Roman Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in Bohemia by the Roman Catholic Church while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the Reformation, some Bohemians went with the teachings of Martin Luther, especially Sudeten Germans. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly anti-Catholic stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions were revived. After the Habsburgs regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Roman Catholicism—even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A history of resistance to the Roman Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite Czechoslovak Hussite Church in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing secularization. Protestantism never recovered after the Counter-Reformation was introduced by the Austrian Habsburgs in 1620. Prior to the Holocaust, the Czech Republic had a sizable Jewish community of around 100,000. There are many historically important and culturally relevant Synagogues in the Czech Republic such as Europe's oldest active Synagogue, The Old New Synagogue and the second largest Synagogue in Europe, the Great Synagogue (Plzeň). The Holocaust decimated Czech Jewry and the Jewish population as of 2021 is 3,900.[210]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% were Roman Catholic, 0.8% were Protestant (0.5% Czech Brethren and 0.4% Hussite),[211] and 9% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are Pagan). 45% of the population did not answer the question about religion.[204] From 1991 to 2001 and further to 2011 the adherence to Roman Catholicism decreased from 39% to 27% and then to 10%; Protestantism similarly declined from 3.7% to 2% and then to 0.8%.[212] The Muslim population is estimated to be 20,000 representing 0.2% of the population.[213]\n\nThe proportion of religious believers varies significantly across the country, from 55% in Zlín Region to 16% in Ústí nad Labem Region.[214]\n\nEducation in the Czech Republic is compulsory for nine years and citizens have access to a free-tuition university education, while the average number of years of education is 13.1.[215] Additionally, the Czech Republic has a \"relatively equal\" educational system in comparison with other countries in Europe.[215] Founded in 1348, Charles University was the first university in Central Europe. Other major universities in the country are Masaryk University, Czech Technical University, Palacký University, Academy of Performing Arts and University of Economics.\n\nThe Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks the Czech education system as the 15th most successful in the world, higher than the OECD average.[216] The UN Education Index ranks the Czech Republic 10th as of 2013 (positioned behind Denmark and ahead of South Korea).[217]\n\nHealth care in the Czech Republic is similar in quality to that of other developed nations. The Czech universal health care system is based on a compulsory insurance model, with fee-for-service care funded by mandatory employment-related insurance plans.[218] According to the 2016 Euro health consumer index, a comparison of healthcare in Europe, the Czech healthcare is 13th, ranked behind Sweden and two positions ahead of the United Kingdom.[219]\n\nVenus of Dolní Věstonice is an important example of prehistoric art unearthed in the Czech Republic. Theodoric of Prague was a painter in the Gothic era who decorated the castle Karlštejn. In the Baroque era, there were painters Wenceslaus Hollar, Jan Kupecký, Karel Škréta, Anton Raphael Mengs and Petr Brandl and sculptors Matthias Braun and Ferdinand Brokoff.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, Josef Mánes joined the romantic movement. In the second half the so-called \"National Theatre generation\" rose to prominence: sculptor Josef Václav Myslbek and painters Mikoláš Aleš, Václav Brožík, Vojtěch Hynais and Julius Mařák. At the end of the century came Art Nouveau, with Alfons Mucha becoming its main representative. He is known for his Art Nouveau posters and a cycle of 20 large canvases named the Slav Epic, which depicts the history of Czechs and other Slavs. As of 2012 , it can be seen in the Veletržní Palace of the National Gallery in Prague, which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. Max Švabinský was another Art Nouveau painter.\n\nThe 20th century brought an avant-garde revolution, represented in the Czech lands mainly by expressionists and cubists: Josef Čapek, Emil Filla, Bohumil Kubišta or Jan Zrzavý. Surrealism emerged particularly through the work of Toyen, Josef Šíma and Karel Teige. In the world, however, the most well-known Czech avant-garde artist might be František Kupka, a pioneer of abstract painting. Illustrators and cartoonists to gain fame in the first half of the 20th century include Josef Lada, Zdeněk Burian or Emil Orlík. Art photography became a new field represented by František Drtikol, Josef Sudek, later Jan Saudek and Josef Koudelka.\n\nThe Czech Republic is also known for its individually made, mouth-blown, and decorated Bohemian glass.\n\nThe earliest preserved stone buildings in Bohemia and Moravia date back to the time of the Christianization in the 9th and 10th centuries. Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of Western and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the Romanesque style. During the 13th century, it was replaced by the Gothic style. In the 14th century, Emperor Charles IV invited architects from France and Germany, Matthias of Arras and Peter Parler, to his court in Prague. During the Middle Ages, some fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as some monasteries.\n\nThe Renaissance style penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be mixed with Renaissance elements. An example of pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the Queen Anne's Summer Palace, which was situated in the garden of Prague Castle. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving an influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious chateaus with arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens.[220] Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.[221]\n\nIn the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia.[222]\n\nIn the 18th century, Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity – the Baroque Gothic style, a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles.[220]\n\nDuring the 19th century stands the revival architectural styles. Some churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed buildings in the Neo-Romanesque, Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance styles. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the new art style appeared in the Czech lands – Art Nouveau.\n\nBohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the Cubism of painting and sculpture into architecture.\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, Functionalism, with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style.[220]\n\nAfter World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became Soviet-influenced. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement is known as the Brussels style came up in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. Brutalism dominated in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Czech Republic is not shying away from the more modern trends of international architecture, an example is the Dancing House (Tančící dům) in Prague, Golden Angel in Prague or Congress Centre in Zlín.[220]\n\nThe literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in Latin and German or even Old Church Slavonic. Franz Kafka, although a competent user of Czech, wrote in his mother tongue, German.[223][224] His works include The Trial and The Castle.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of German Minnesang and courtly literature. The Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nBible translations played a role in the development of Czech literature. The oldest Czech translation of the Psalms originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488. The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593. The Codex Gigas from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.[225]\n\nCzech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages; the Hussite period; the Renaissance humanism; the Baroque period; the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century, modern literature in the second half of the 19th century; the avant-garde of the interwar period; the years under Communism; and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe antiwar comedy novel The Good Soldier Švejk is the most translated Czech book in history.\n\nThe international literary award the Franz Kafka Prize is awarded in the Czech Republic.[226]\n\nThe Czech Republic has the densest network of libraries in Europe.[227]\n\nCzech literature and culture played a role on at least two occasions when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.[228]\n\nThe musical tradition of the Czech lands arose from the first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of the 10th and 11th centuries. Some pieces of Czech music include two chorales, which in their time performed the function of anthems: \"Lord, Have Mercy on Us\" and the hymn \"Saint Wenceslaus\" or \"Saint Wenceslaus Chorale\".[229] The authorship of the anthem \"Lord, Have Mercy on Us\" is ascribed by some historians to Saint Adalbert of Prague (sv.Vojtěch), bishop of Prague, living between 956 and 997.[230]\n\nThe wealth of musical culture lies in the classical music tradition during all historical periods, especially in the Baroque, Classicism, Romantic, modern classical music and in the traditional folk music of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. Since the early era of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have been influenced the folk music of the region and dance.\n\nCzech music can be considered to have been \"beneficial\" in both the European and worldwide context, several times co-determined or even determined a newly arriving era in musical art,[231] above all of Classical era, as well as by original attitudes in Baroque, Romantic and modern classical music. Some Czech musical works are The Bartered Bride, New World Symphony, Sinfonietta and Jenůfa.\n\nA music festival in the country is Prague Spring International Music Festival of classical music, a permanent showcase for performing artists, symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles of the world.\n\nThe roots of Czech theatre can be found in the Middle Ages, especially in the cultural life of the Gothic period. In the 19th century, the theatre played a role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century, it became a part of modern European theatre art. The original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called Laterna magika, resulting in productions that combined theater, dance, and film in a poetic manner, considered the first multimedia art project in an international context.\n\nOne drama is Karel Čapek's play R.U.R., which introduced the word \"robot\".[232]\n\nThe country has a tradition of puppet theater. In 2016, Czech and Slovak Puppetry was included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[233]\n\nThe tradition of Czech cinematography started in the second half of the 1890s. Peaks of the production in the era of silent movies include the historical drama The Builder of the Temple and the social and erotic drama Erotikon directed by Gustav Machatý.[234] The early Czech sound film era was productive, above all in mainstream genres, with the comedies of Martin Frič or Karel Lamač. There were dramatic movies sought internationally.[citation needed]\n\nHermína Týrlová was a prominent Czech animator, screenwriter, and film director. She was often called the mother of Czech animation. Over the course of her career, she produced over 60 animated children's short films using puppets and the technique of stop motion animation.[citation needed]\n\nBefore the German occupation, in 1933, filmmaker and animator Irena Dodalová [cs] established the first Czech animation studio \"IRE Film\" with her husband Karel Dodal.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the period of Nazi occupation and early communist official dramaturgy of socialist realism in movies at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s with fewer exceptions such as Krakatit or Men without wings (awarded by Palme d'Or in 1946), an era of the Czech film began with animated films, performed in anglophone countries under the name \"The Fabulous World of Jules Verne\" from 1958, which combined acted drama with animation, and Jiří Trnka, the founder of the modern puppet film.[235] This began a tradition of animated films (Mole etc.).\n\nIn the 1960s, the hallmark of Czechoslovak New Wave's films were improvised dialogues, black and absurd humor and the occupation of non-actors. Directors are trying to preserve natural atmosphere without refinement and artificial arrangement of scenes. A personality of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s with original manuscript and psychological impact is František Vláčil. Another international author is Jan Švankmajer, a filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media. He is a self-labeled surrealist known for animations and features.[236]\n\nThe Barrandov Studios in Prague are the largest film studios with film locations in the country.[237] Filmmakers have come to Prague to shoot scenery no longer found in Berlin, Paris and Vienna. The city of Karlovy Vary was used as a location for the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale.[238]\n\nThe Czech Lion is the highest Czech award for film achievement. Karlovy Vary International Film Festival is one of the film festivals that have been given competitive status by the FIAPF. Other film festivals held in the country include Febiofest, Jihlava International Documentary Film Festival, One World Film Festival, Zlín Film Festival and Fresh Film Festival.\n\nCzech journalists and media enjoy a degree of freedom. There are restrictions against writing in support of Nazism, racism or violating Czech law. The Czech press was ranked as the 40th most free press in the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders in 2021.[239] Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has its headquarters in Prague.\n\nCzech Television is the country's national public television broadcaster. It operates a number of channels, including ČT1, ČT2, and the 24-hour news channel ČT24, as well as the news website ct24.cz. As of 2020, it is the most watched broadcaster, followed by the private TV Nova and Prima TV. However, TV Nova features the most watched main news program and prime time program.[240] Other public media services include the Czech Radio and the Czech News Agency.\n\nThe best-selling daily national newspapers in 2020/21 are Blesk (average 703,000 daily readers), Mladá fronta DNES (average 461,000 daily readers), Právo (average 182,000 daily readers), Lidové noviny (average 163,000 daily readers) and Hospodářské noviny (average 162,000 daily readers).[241]\n\nMost Czechs (87%[242]) read their news online,[243] with Seznam.cz, iDNES.cz, Novinky.cz, iPrima.cz and Seznam Zprávy.cz being the most visited as of 2021.[244]\n\nCzech cuisine is marked by an emphasis on meat dishes with pork, beef, and chicken. Goose, duck, rabbit, and venison are served. Fish is less common, with the occasional exception of fresh trout and carp, which is served at Christmas.[245][246] One popular Czech menu item is smažený vepřový řízek (fried breaded pork filet), served with boiled potatoes.[247]\n\nThere is a variety of local sausages, wurst, pâtés, and smoked and cured meats. Czech desserts include a variety of whipped cream, chocolate, and fruit pastries and tarts, crêpes, creme desserts and cheese, poppy-seed-filled and other types of traditional cakes such as buchty, koláče and štrúdl.[248]\n\nCzech beer has a history extending more than a millennium; the earliest known brewery existed in 993. Today, the Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita in the world. The pilsner style beer (pils) originated in Plzeň, where the world's first blond lager Pilsner Urquell is still produced. It has served as the inspiration for more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today. The city of České Budějovice has similarly lent its name to its beer, known as Budweiser Budvar.\n\nThe South Moravian region has been producing wine since the Middle Ages; about 94% of vineyards in the Czech Republic are Moravian. Aside from beer, slivovitz and wine, the Czech Republic also produces two liquors, Fernet Stock and Becherovka. Kofola is a non-alcoholic domestic cola soft drink which competes with Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\nThe most watched and most attended sport in the Czech Republic are football and ice hockey.[250] The most watched sporting events are the Ice hockey at the Olympic Games and the Ice Hockey World Championships.[251][252] The most popular sports in the Czech Republic according to the size of the membership base of sports clubs are: football, tennis, ice hockey, volleyball, floorball, golf, ball hockey, athletics, basketball and skiing.[253]\n\nThe country has won 15 gold medals in the Summer Olympics and nine in the Winter Games. (See Olympic history.) The Czech ice hockey team won the gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics and has won (along with the Czechoslovakian team) thirteen gold medals at the World Championships, including three straight from 1999 to 2001.[254]\n\nThe Škoda Motorsport is engaged in competition racing since 1901 and has gained a number of titles with various vehicles around the world. MTX automobile company was formerly engaged in the manufacture of racing and formula cars since 1969.[255]\n\nHiking is a popular sport. The word for 'tourist' in Czech, turista, also means 'trekker' or 'hiker'. For hikers, thanks to the more than 120-year-old tradition, there is the Czech Hiking Markers System of trail blazing, that has been adopted by countries worldwide. There is a network of around 40,000 km of marked short- and long-distance trails crossing the whole country and all the Czech mountains.[256][257]\n• #VisitCzechia – official tourist portal of the Czech Republic"}

Moravě (Czech pronunciation: [ˈnovɛː ˈmɲɛsto ˈna moravjɛ]; German: Neustadt in Mähren) is a town in Žďár nad Sázavou District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 9,900 inhabitants. It is known as a winter sports resort. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\n\nThe villages of Hlinné, Jiříkovice, Maršovice, Olešná, Petrovice, Pohledec, Rokytno, Slavkovice and Studnice are administrative parts of Nové Město na Moravě.\n\nThe name of the town literally means \"New Town in Moravia\".\n\nNové Město na Moravě is located about 9 kilometres (6 mi) east of Žďár nad Sázavou and 53 km (33 mi) northwest of Brno. It lies in the Křižanov Highlands, in the highest parts of the whole Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. The highest point is Kopeček at 822 m (2,697 ft) above sea level. The upper course of the Bobrůvka River flows through the town and supplies several small fishponds there. Most of the municipal territory is located in the Žďárské vrchy Protected Landscape Area.\n\nThe first written mention of Nové Město na Moravě is from 1267 under the name Bočkov. It was founded during the colonization by royal burgrave Boček of Obřany after the nearby Cistercian monastery in Žďár nad Sázavou was established in 1252, not later than in 1255. The name Nové Město was used for the first time in a deed of King Wenceslaus II from 1293 and it was first referred to as a market town.[2]\n\nIn 1312, Nové Město was inherited by lords of Lipá. Probably in the late 14th century, they had built a fortress here. In 1496, it was acquired by Vilém II of Pernštejn. During the rule of the Pernštejn family (especially under Vratislav II of Pernštejn in 1561–1582), the town experienced an economic boom. The Renaissance town hall was built and the fortress was rebuilt into a Renaissance castle. The Pernštejn family owned Nové Město until 1588. The next owners were Vilém Dubský, who reconstructed the castle, Archbishop Franz von Dietrichstein, and the Kratzer family, who took care of the economic prosperity of the estate and supported glass making and ironworks in the estate.[2]\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, skiing developed, thanks to which the town became a centre of winter sports.

Existing law, the Seymour-Campbell Student Success Act of 2012, provides that the purpose of the act is to increase California community college student access and success by providing effective core matriculation services of orientation, assessment and placement, counseling, and other education planning services, and academic interventions. Existing law requires a community college district or college to maximize the probability that a student will enter and complete transfer-level coursework in English and mathematics within a one-year timeframe. Existing law requires, for those students placed into credit English as a second language (ESL) coursework, community colleges to maximize the probability that the student will complete degree and transfer requirements in English within 3 years. Existing law also requires multiple measures to apply in the placement of all students, as provided.\n\nExisting law also establishes the Student Equity and Achievement Program, pursuant to which funding may be provided to support the California Community Colleges in implementing activities and practices that, among other things, advance the systemwide goal of eliminating achievement gaps for students from traditionally underrepresented groups.\n\nThis bill would provide that, as a condition for receiving funding pursuant to the Student Equity and Achievement Program, a community college would be required to do all of the following: inform students of their rights to access transfer-level coursework and academic credit ESL coursework, and of the multiple measures placement policies developed by the community college, as provided; annually report to the Office of the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges the community college’s placement policies and placement results; publicly post its placement results; and implement these provisions by a specified date. The bill would state the intent of the Legislature that the chancellor’s office make the collected placement policies and placement data publicly available, except for personally identifiable information, by posting the data on its Internet Web site or making it publicly available upon request."}

The film is a sequel to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey and adapts Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 novel 2010: Odyssey Two. 2010 follows a joint American and Soviet crew who are sent to Jupiter to discover the reason behind the failure of the Discovery One mission. The film stars Roy Scheider, Helen Mirren, Bob Balaban, and John Lithgow, along with Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain, stars of the previous film.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on December 7, 1984. 2010 received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the special effects but considered the film inferior to its predecessor. It earned $40.4 million at the domestic box office against a budget of $28 million.\n\nNine years after the failure of the Discovery One mission to Jupiter in 2001,[a] in which the crew of five, including mission commander David Bowman, were lost, an international dispute causes tension between the United States and the Soviet Union while both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the Discovery. The Soviet spacecraft Leonov will be ready a year before the American Discovery Two, but only the Americans can reactivate the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, thought to be responsible for the disaster. Upon learning that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before the American mission can reach it, the NCA[b] persuades the Soviets to include Dr. Heywood Floyd, Discovery designer Walter Curnow, and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra on their mission.\n\nArriving at Jupiter, the crew detects chlorophyll on Jupiter's icy moon Europa, moving toward the sun at the rate of one meter per minute. A probe sent to investigate is destroyed by an energy burst, which the Soviets believe to be electrostatic build-up, but which Floyd suspects is a warning to stay away from Europa. Finding Discovery adrift in orbit over Io, Curnow reactivates the ship, and Chandra restarts HAL. Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky investigates the giant monolith where Bowman disappeared, but his EVA pod is destroyed by a burst of energy.\n\nOn Earth, Dave Bowman, now an incorporeal being, appears through his former wife's television to say goodbye, telling her that \"something wonderful\" is going to happen. He then visits his comatose mother in a nursing home. She briefly awakens, delighted by her son's presence, as Bowman gently brushes her hair. After he departs, Mrs. Bowman dies peacefully.\n\nChandra discovers the reasons for HAL's malfunction: the National Security Council ordered HAL to conceal information about the monolith from the Discovery's crew, and programmed him to complete the mission alone. This conflicted with HAL's programming of open, accurate processing of information, causing the computer equivalent of a paranoid mental breakdown. When Bowman and copilot Frank Poole discussed deactivating the malfunctioning computer, HAL concluded that the human crew was endangering the mission, and terminated them. Although the NSC's order bears his signature, Floyd angrily denies having known of it.\n\nBack on Earth, the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. The Americans are ordered to leave the Leonov and move to the Discovery, with no further communication between the crews. Both ships plan to leave Jupiter in several weeks' time, but Bowman appears to Floyd, and says that everyone must leave within two days. Floyd confers with the skeptical Soviet captain, Tanya Kirbuk. As the crews agree to cooperate on an emergency departure, the monolith suddenly disappears, and an ominous black spot appears in Jupiter's atmosphere. Neither ship has the fuel to reach Earth if they leave ahead of schedule, so the ships are docked together, and placed under the control of HAL 9000. Discovery's remaining fuel will be burned to propel the Leonov away from Jupiter; then Discovery will be undocked and left behind.\n\nHAL determines that the spot is a vast group of smaller monoliths, multiplying exponentially and altering Jupiter's mass and chemical composition. He suggests canceling the launch to study the changes occurring to Jupiter. Floyd worries that HAL will prioritize his mission over the humans' survival, but Chandra admits to the computer that a danger exists, and that Discovery may be destroyed. HAL thanks Chandra for telling him the truth, and ensures the Leonov's escape. Before Discovery is destroyed, Bowman asks HAL to transmit a priority message, assuring him that they will soon be together. The monoliths engulf Jupiter, which undergoes nuclear fusion, becoming a new star. HAL transmits this message to Earth:\n\nThe Leonov survives the shockwave from Jupiter's ignition, and returns home. Floyd narrates how the new star's miraculous appearance, and the message from a mysterious alien power, inspire the American and Soviet leaders to seek peace. Under its infant sun, icy Europa transforms into a humid jungle, covered with life, and watched over by a monolith.\n\nIn addition, background crew members on the Leonov are played by Victor Steinbach and Jan Triska, while Herta Ware briefly appears as Bowman's mother. Candice Bergen, credited as \"Olga Mallsnerd\", voices the SAL 9000.\n\nArthur C. Clarke, author of the novels for 2001 and 2010, appears as a man on a park bench feeding pigeons outside the White House (visible in the letterboxed and widescreen versions). In addition, a Time cover about the American–Soviet tension is briefly shown, in which the President of the United States is portrayed by Clarke and the Soviet Premier by 2001's writer, producer, and director, Stanley Kubrick.\n\nWhen Clarke published his novel 2010: Odyssey Two in 1982, he telephoned Stanley Kubrick, and jokingly said, \"Your job is to stop anybody [from] making it [into a film] so I won't be bothered.\"[4] Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer subsequently worked out a contract to make a film adaptation, but Kubrick had no interest in directing it. However, Peter Hyams was interested and contacted both Clarke and Kubrick for their blessings:\n\nWhile he was writing the screenplay in 1983, Hyams (in Los Angeles) began communicating with Clarke (in Sri Lanka) via the then-pioneering medium of e-mail using Kaypro II computers and direct-dial modems. They discussed the planning and production of the film almost daily using this method, and their informal, often humorous correspondence was published in 1984 as The Odyssey File. As it focuses on the screenwriting and pre-production process, the book terminates on February 7, 1984, just before the movie is about to start filming, though it does include 16 pages of behind-the-scenes photographs from the film.[5][6] Clarke's preface offers a gleeful, elaborate primer on the use of electronic mail. The Odyssey File is available in its entirety on the Internet Archive.[7]\n\nPrincipal photography on the film began in February 1984 for a 71-day schedule. The majority of the film was shot on MGM's soundstages in Culver City, California, with the exception of a week of location work in Washington, DC, Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and at the Very Large Array in New Mexico.[8] Originally, Hyams had intended to film the opening scene at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, home of the world's largest radio telescope, but after visiting there in 1983, he told Clarke that the site was unsuitable for filming.[5]\n\nVideo Image (also known as VIFX), which would go on to work on a number of major pictures and briefly become 20th Century Fox's in-house visual effects studio, did its first work on this film, designing the video screen graphics.[9]\n\nInitially, Tony Banks, keyboardist for the band Genesis, was commissioned to do the soundtrack for 2010: The Year We Make Contact. However, Banks' material was rejected[10] and David Shire was then selected to compose and conduct the score, which he co-produced along with Craig Huxley. The soundtrack album was released by A&M Records.\n\nUnlike many film soundtracks up until then, the soundtrack for 2010: The Year We Make Contact was composed for and played mainly using digital synthesizers. These included the Synclavier by the New England Digital company and a Yamaha DX1. Only two compositions on the soundtrack album feature a symphony orchestra. Shire and Huxley were so impressed by the realistic sound of the Synclavier that they placed a disclaimer in the album's liner notes stating, \"No resynthesis or sampling was employed on the Synclavier.\"[11]\n\nThe Police's guitarist Andy Summers performed a track entitled \"2010\", which was a modern new-wave pop version of Richard Strauss's \"Also Sprach Zarathustra\" (which had been the main theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey). Though Summers' recording was included on the soundtrack album and released as a single, it was not used in the film. For the B-side to the single, Summers recorded another 2010-based track entitled \"To Hal and Back\", though this appeared in neither the film nor the soundtrack album.[12][13]\n\n2010: The Year We Make Contact debuted at number two at the North American box office, taking $7,393,361 for its opening weekend.[14] It was held off from the top spot by Beverly Hills Cop, which became that year's highest-grossing film in North America. During its second week, the film faced competition from two other new sci-fi films: John Carpenter's Starman and David Lynch's Dune,[15] but ultimately outgrossed both by the end of its domestic theatrical run. It finished with just over $40 million at the domestic box office and was the 17th-highest-grossing film in North America to be released in 1984.[16]\n\nIn 1984, Marvel Comics published a 48-page comic-book adaptation of the film by writer J. M. DeMatteis and artists Joe Barney, Larry Hama, and Tom Palmer. It was published both as a single volume in Marvel Super Special #37[17] and as a two-issue miniseries.[18]\n\n2010: The Year We Make Contact was first released on home video and laserdisc in 1985, and on DVD (R1) in 1998 by MGM. It was reissued (with different artwork) in September 2000. Both releases are presented with the soundtrack remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround sound and in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, though a packaging error appears on the 2000 Warner release, claiming that the film is presented in anamorphic widescreen when, in reality, it is simply 4:3 letterboxed and not anamorphic (the MGM version of the DVD makes no such claim). The R1 and R4 releases also include the film trailer and a 10-minute behind-the-scenes featurette 2010: The Odyssey Continues (made at the time of the film's production), though this is not available in other regions.\n\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc on April 7, 2009. It features a BD-25 single-layer presentation, now in high-definition 16:9 (2.40:1) widescreen with 1080p/VC-1 video and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround audio. In all regions, the disc also includes the film's original \"making of\" promotional featurette (as above) and theatrical trailer in standard definition as extras.\n\nCritical reception to 2010: The Year We Make Contact was mixed.[19][20] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 67% of 36 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.80/10. The website's consensus reads: \"2010 struggles to escape from the shadow of its monolithic predecessor, but offers brainy adventure in a more straightforward voyage through the cosmos.\"[21] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 53 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[22] Critics generally considered the film inferior to 2001: A Space Odyssey,[23]: 14–15 and considered its story \"too literal in laboriously explaining\" the mysteries of the original film.[24]: 142 Syd Mead's designs for the film received critical acclaim.[25]: 64\n\nRoger Ebert gave 2010: The Year We Make Contact three stars out of four, writing, \"It doesn't match the poetry and the mystery of the original film, but it does continue the story, and it offers sound, pragmatic explanations for many of the strange and visionary things in 2001.\" He praised it as a \"triumph of hardware, of special effects, of slick, exciting filmmaking\". Ebert also wrote it \"has an ending that is infuriating, not only in its simplicity, but in its inadequacy to fulfill the sense of anticipation, the sense of wonder we felt at the end of 2001\". He concluded, however: \"And yet the truth must be told: This is a good movie. Once we've drawn our lines, once we've made it absolutely clear that 2001 continues to stand absolutely alone as one of the greatest movies ever made, once we have freed 2010 of the comparisons with Kubrick's masterpiece, what we are left with is a good-looking, sharp-edged, entertaining, exciting space opera\".[26]\n\nColin Greenland reviewed 2010 for Imagine, calling it \"a tense space drama with excellent performances from Helen Mirren and John Lithgow, and glorious special effects. For everyone who was mystified by 2001.\"[27]\n\nJames Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"2010 continues 2001 without ruining it. The greatest danger faced by filmmakers helming a sequel is that a bad installment will in some way sour the experience of watching the previous movie. This does not happen here. Almost paradoxically, 2010 may be unnecessary, but it is nevertheless a worthwhile effort.\"[28] He wrote that the visual effects \"are as good as, although not noticeably better than, those used in 2001\".[28]\n\nReviewing the film for BBC, Almar Haflidason praised the film's cinematography and visual effects. He wrote, \"by writing, producing and directing a follow-up to 2001, [Hyams] was really putting his head on the block if he screwed it up. Thankfully for him he didn't.\" Through narrative storytelling, Haflidason describes the film as a chance for Clarke and Hyams to explain what 2001 was about. The review praises Hyams's narrative-based handling of the tension between the Soviet and American teams, and says that his \"skills as a cinematographer are evident with fine visual effects throughout.\"[29]\n\nA review in Time Out describes a film that, while not as revolutionary as its predecessor, \"is still a better film than anyone could have dared to expect,\" and describing it as \"space fiction of a superior kind\".[30]\n\nOther critics had more negative opinions. Vincent Canby of The New York Times gave 2010: The Year We Make Contact a lukewarm review, calling it \"a perfectly adequate though not really comparable sequel\" that \"is without wit, which is not to say that it is witless. A lot of care has gone into it, but it has no satirical substructure to match that of the Kubrick film, and which was eventually responsible for that film's continuing popularity.\"[31]\n\nVariety considered the film a mess, although not without bright spots. \"In Peter Hyams' hands [working from a novel by Arthur C. Clarke], the HAL mystery is the most satisfying substance of the film and handled the best. Unfortunately, it lies amid a hodge-podge of bits and pieces.\"[32] TIME was dismissive, writing, \"Flash: There is intelligent life in outer space. More, anyway, than in this amiable footnote of a movie.\"[33]\n\n2010: The Year We Make Contact was nominated for five Academy Awards:[34][35]\n\nThe film was also nominated for three Saturn Awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Costumes (Patricia Norris), and Best Special Effects (Richard Edlund).[36]\n\nIt won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1985.[37]\n• The Bamboo Saucer, a 1968 film where Soviet and American teams collaborate on the recovery of a flying saucer.2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design: The Department of Justice published revised regulations for Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA in the Federal Register on September 15, 2010. These regulations adopted revised, enforceable accessibility standards called the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design 2010 Standards or Standards. The 2010 Standards set minimum requirements – both scoping and technical – for newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n\nRead this document to understand your legal rights or responsibilities under the ADA.\n\nThe Department of Justice published revised regulations for Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 “ADA” in the Federal Register on September 15, 2010. These regulations adopted revised, enforceable accessibility standards called the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design “2010 Standards” or “Standards”. The 2010 Standards set minimum requirements – both scoping and technical – for newly designed and constructed or altered State and local government facilities, public accommodations, and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n\nAdoption of the 2010 Standards also establishes a revised reference point for Title II entities that choose to make structural changes to existing facilities to meet their program accessibility requirements; and it establishes a similar reference for Title III entities undertaking readily achievable barrier removal.\n\nThe Department has assembled this online version of the official 2010 Standards to increase its ease of use. This version includes:\n\nThe Department has assembled into a separate publication the revised regulation guidance that applies to the Standards. The Department included guidance in its revised ADA regulations published on September 15, 2010. This guidance provides detailed information about the Department’s adoption of the 2010 Standards including changes to the Standards, the reasoning behind those changes, and responses to public comments received on these topics. The document, Guidance on the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design, can be downloaded from https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/design-standards/standards-guidance/\n\nFor information about the ADA, including the revised 2010 ADA regulations, please visit the Department’s website www.ADA.gov; or, for answers to specific questions, call the toll-free ADA Information Line at 800-514-0301 (Voice) or 833‐610‐1264 (TTY).\n\nState and local government facilities must follow the requirements of the 2010 Standards, including both the Title II regulations at 28 CFR 35.151; and the 2004 ADAAG at 36 CFR part 1191, appendices B and D.\n\nIn the few places where requirements between the two differ, the requirements of 28 CFR 35.151 prevail.\n\nIf the start date for construction is on or after March 15, 2012, all newly constructed or altered State and local government facilities must comply with the 2010 Standards. Before that date, the 1991 Standards (without the elevator exemption), the UFAS, or the 2010 Standards may be used for such projects when the start of construction commences on or after September 15, 2010.\n\n(1) Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity shall be designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the construction was commenced after January 26, 1992.\n\n(i) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where a public entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\n\n(ii) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.\n\n(iii) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities, (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.\n\n(1) Each facility or part of a facility altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if the alteration was commenced after January 26, 1992.\n\n(2) The path of travel requirements of § 35.151(b)(4) shall apply only to alterations undertaken solely for purposes other than to meet the program accessibility requirements of § 35.150.\n\n(i) Alterations to historic properties shall comply, to the maximum extent feasible, with the provisions applicable to historic properties in the design standards specified in § 35.151(c).\n\n(ii) If it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of § 35.150.\n\n(4) Path of travel. An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.\n\n(i) Primary function. A “primary function” is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public entity using the facility are carried out.\n\n(A) Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, and corridors are not areas containing a primary function. Restrooms are not areas containing a primary function unless the provision of restrooms is a primary purpose of the area, e.g., in highway rest stops.\n\n(B) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.\n\n(ii) A “path of travel” includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.\n\n(A) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these elements.\n\n(B) For the purposes of this section, the term “path of travel” also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area.\n\n(C) Safe harbor. If a public entity has constructed or altered required elements of a path of travel in accordance with the specifications in either the 1991 Standards or the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards before March 15, 2012, the public entity is not required to retrofit such elements to reflect incremental changes in the 2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary function area served by that path of travel.\n\n(A) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20 % of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.\n\n(B) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include:\n\n(1) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;\n\n(2) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;\n\n(3) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing a text telephone (TTY); and\n\n(4) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.\n\n(iv) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality.\n\n(A) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.\n\n(B) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order—\n\n(2) An accessible route to the altered area;\n\n(3) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom;\n\n(6) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.\n\n(A) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.\n\n(1) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.\n\n(2) Only alterations undertaken on or after March 15, 2011, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.\n\n(1) If physical construction or alterations commence after July 26, 1992, but prior to the September 15, 2010, then new construction and alterations subject to this section must comply with either the UFAS or the 1991 Standards except that the elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5) and section 4.1.6(1)(k) of the 1991 Standards shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby provided.\n\n(2) If physical construction or alterations commence on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations subject to this section may comply with one of the following: the 2010 Standards, UFAS, or the 1991 Standards except that the elevator exemption contained at section 4.1.3(5) and section 4.1.6(1)(k) of the 1991 Standards shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements of either standard by the use of other methods shall be permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby provided.\n\n(3) If physical construction or alterations commence on or after March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations subject to this section shall comply with the 2010 Standards.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this section, ceremonial groundbreaking or razing of structures prior to site preparation do not commence physical construction or alterations.\n\n(i) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 35.151(a) or (b) that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012, and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards or with UFAS shall before March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with either the 1991 Standards, UFAS, or the 2010 Standards.\n\n(ii) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 35.151(a) or (b) that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012 and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards or with UFAS shall, on or after March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.\n\n(d) Scope of coverage. The 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards apply to fixed or built-in elements of buildings, structures, site improvements, and pedestrian routes or vehicular ways located on a site. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the advisory notes, appendix notes, and figures contained in the 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards explain or illustrate the requirements of the rule; they do not establish enforceable requirements.\n\n(e) Social service center establishments. Group homes, halfway houses, shelters, or similar social service center establishments that provide either temporary sleeping accommodations or residential dwelling units that are subject to this section shall comply with the provisions of the 2010 Standards applicable to residential facilities, including, but not limited to, the provisions in sections 233 and 809.\n\n(d) Scope of coverage. The 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards apply to fixed or built-in elements of buildings, structures, site improvements, and pedestrian routes or vehicular ways located on a site.

If that date is on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, then new construction and alterations must comply with either the 1991 or the 2010 Standards.\n\n(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, discrimination for purposes of this part includes a failure to design and construct facilities for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, that are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n\n(2) For purposes of this section, a facility is designed and constructed for first occupancy after January 26, 1993, only –\n\n(i) If the last application for a building permit or permit extension for the facility is certified to be complete, by a State, County, or local government after January 26, 1992 (or, in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify completion of applications, if the last application for a building permit or permit extension for the facility is received by the State, County, or local government after January 26, 1992); and\n\n(ii) If the first certificate of occupancy for the facility is issued after January 26, 1993.\n\n(1) When a commercial facility is located in a private residence, the portion of the residence used exclusively as a residence is not covered by this subpart, but that portion used exclusively in the operation of the commercial facility or that portion used both for the commercial facility and for residential purposes is covered by the new construction and alterations requirements of this subpart.\n\n(2) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph (b)(1) of this section extends to those elements used to enter the commercial facility, including the homeowner’s front sidewalk, if any, the door or entryway, and hallways; and those portions of the residence, interior or exterior, available to or used by employees or visitors of the commercial facility, including restrooms.\n\n(1) Full compliance with the requirements of this section is not required where an entity can demonstrate that it is structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility features.\n\n(2) If full compliance with this section would be structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is required to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent that it is not structurally impracticable.\n\n(3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance with this section.\n\n(1) For purposes of this paragraph (d) –\n\n(i) Professional office of a health care provider means a location where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional services related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes such services available to the public. The facility housing the “professional office of a health care provider” only includes floor levels housing at least one health care provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one health care provider.\n\n(A) A building housing five or more sales or rental establishments; or\n\n(B) A series of buildings on a common site, either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. For purposes of this section, places of public accommodation of the types listed in paragraph (5) of the definition of “place of public accommodation” in section § 36.104 are considered sales or rental establishments. The facility housing a “shopping center or shopping mall” only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.\n\n(2) This section does not require the installation of an elevator in a facility that is less than three stories or has less than 3000 square feet per story, except with respect to any facility that houses one or more of the following:\n\n(i) A shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of a health care provider.\n\n(ii) A terminal, depot, or other station used for specified public transportation, or an airport passenger terminal. In such a facility, any area housing passenger services, including boarding and debarking, loading and unloading, baggage claim, dining facilities, and other common areas open to the public, must be on an accessible route from an accessible entrance.\n\n(3) The elevator exemption set forth in this paragraph (d) does not obviate or limit, in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in paragraph (a) of this section. For example, in a facility that houses a shopping center or shopping mall, or a professional office of a health care provider, the floors that are above or below an accessible ground floor and that do not house sales or rental establishments or a professional office of a health care provider, must meet the requirements of this section but for the elevator.\n\n(1) Any alteration to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility, after January 26, 1992, shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the altered portions of the facility are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n\n(2) An alteration is deemed to be undertaken after January 26, 1992, if the physical alteration of the property begins after that date.\n\n(b) Alteration. For the purposes of this part, an alteration is a change to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility that affects or could affect the usability of the building or facility or any part thereof.\n\n(1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.\n\n(2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A to this part.\n\n(c) To the maximum extent feasible. The phrase “to the maximum extent feasible,” as used in this section, applies to the occasional case where the nature of an existing facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with applicable accessibility standards through a planned alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any altered features of the facility that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility in conformance with this section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those who have other impairments).\n\n(1) An alteration that affects or could affect the usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration.\n\n(2) If a private entity has constructed or altered required elements of a path of travel at a place of public accommodation or commercial facility in accordance with the specifications in the 1991 Standards, the private entity is not required to retrofit such elements to reflect the incremental changes in the 2010 Standards solely because of an alteration to a primary function area served by that path of travel.\n\n(b) Primary function. A “primary function” is a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well as offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public accommodation or other private entity using the facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms are not areas containing a primary function.\n\n(c) Alterations to an area containing a primary function.\n\n(1) Alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function include, but are not limited to –\n\n(ii) Replacing an inaccessible floor surface in the customer service or employee work areas of a bank;\n\n(iii) Redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; or\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the usability of or access to an area containing a primary function.\n\n(d) Landlord/tenant: If a tenant is making alterations as defined in § 36.402 that would trigger the requirements of this section, those alterations by the tenant in areas that only the tenant occupies do not trigger a path of travel obligation upon the landlord with respect to areas of the facility under the landlord´s authority, if those areas are not otherwise being altered.\n\n(1) A “path of travel” includes a continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.\n\n(2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these elements.\n\n(3) For the purposes of this part, the term “path of travel” also includes the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains serving the altered area.\n\n(1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area.\n\n(2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to provide an accessible path of travel may include:\n\n(i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;\n\n(ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;\n\n(iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible height, installing amplification devices, or installing a text telephone (TTY);\n\n(iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible drinking fountain.\n\n(g) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of disproportionality.\n\n(1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible without incurring disproportionate costs.\n\n(2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access, in the following order:\n\n(ii) An accessible route to the altered area;\n\n(iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a single unisex restroom;\n\n(vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, storage, and alarms.\n\n(1) The obligation to provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by performing a series of small alterations to the area served by a single path of travel if those alterations could have been performed as a single undertaking.\n\n(i) If an area containing a primary function has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of travel during the preceding three year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.\n\n(ii) Only alterations undertaken after January 26, 1992, shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the overall cost of the alterations.\n\n(a) This section does not require the installation of an elevator in an altered facility that is less than three stories or has less than 3,000 square feet per story, except with respect to any facility that houses a shopping center, a shopping mall, the professional office of a health care provider, a terminal, depot, or other station used for specified public transportation, or an airport passenger terminal.\n\n(1) For the purposes of this section, professional office of a health care provider means a location where a person or entity regulated by a State to provide professional services related to the physical or mental health of an individual makes such services available to the public. The facility that houses a professional office of a health care provider only includes floor levels housing by at least one health care provider, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one health care provider.\n\n(2) For the purposes of this section, shopping center or shopping mall means –\n\n(i) A building housing five or more sales or rental establishments; or\n\n(ii) A series of buildings on a common site, connected by a common pedestrian access route above or below the ground floor, that is either under common ownership or common control or developed either as one project or as a series of related projects, housing five or more sales or rental establishments. For purposes of this section, places of public accommodation of the types listed in paragraph (5) of the definition of place of public accommodation in § 36.104 are considered sales or rental establishments. The facility housing a “shopping center or shopping mall” only includes floor levels housing at least one sales or rental establishment, or any floor level designed or intended for use by at least one sales or rental establishment.\n\n(b) The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements established in this subpart. For example, alterations to floors above or below the accessible ground floor must be accessible regardless of whether the altered facility has an elevator.\n\n(a) Alterations to buildings or facilities that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 .) or are designated as historic under State or local law, shall comply to the maximum extent feasible with this part.\n\n(b) If it is determined that it is not feasible to provide physical access to an historic property that is a place of public accommodation in a manner that will not threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or the facility, alternative methods of access shall be provided pursuant to the requirements of subpart C of this part.\n\n§36.406 Standards for new construction and alterations\n\n(1) New construction and alterations subject to §§ 36.401 or 36.402 shall comply with the 1991 Standards if the date when the last application for a building permit or permit extension is certified to be complete by a State, county, or local government (or, in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify completion of applications, if the date when the last application for a building permit or permit extension is received by the State, county, or local government) is before September 15, 2010, or if no permit is required, if the start of physical construction or alterations occurs before September 15, 2010.\n\n(2) New construction and alterations subject to §§ 36.401 or 36.402 shall comply either with the 1991 Standards or with the 2010 Standards if the date when the last application for a building permit or permit extension is certified to be complete by a State, county, or local government (or, in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify completion of applications, if the date when the last application for a building permit or permit extension is received by the State, county, or local government) is on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012, or if no permit is required, if the start of physical construction or alterations occurs on or after September 15, 2010, and before March 15, 2012.\n\n(3) New construction and alterations subject to §§ 36.401 or 36.402 shall comply with the 2010 Standards if the date when the last application for a building permit or permit extension is certified to be complete by a State, county, or local government (or, in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify completion of applications, if the date when the last application for a building permit or permit extension is received by the State, county, or local government) is on or after March 15, 2012, or if no permit is required, if the start of physical construction or alterations occurs on or after March 15, 2012.\n\n(4) For the purposes of this section, “start of physical construction or alterations” does not mean ceremonial groundbreaking or razing of structures prior to site preparation.\n\n(i) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 36.401 or 36.402 that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012 and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards shall, before March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with either the 1991 Standards or the 2010 Standards.\n\n(ii) Newly constructed or altered facilities or elements covered by §§ 36.401 or 36.402 that were constructed or altered before March 15, 2012 and that do not comply with the 1991 Standards shall, on or after March 15, 2012, be made accessible in accordance with the 2010 Standards.\n\n(b) Scope of coverage. The 1991 Standards and the 2010 Standards apply to fixed or built-in elements of buildings, structures, site improvements, and pedestrian routes or vehicular ways located on a site. Unless specifically stated otherwise, advisory notes, appendix notes, and figures contained in the 1991 Standards and 2010 Standards explain or illustrate the requirements of the rule; they do not establish enforceable requirements.\n\n(c) Places of lodging.

Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the \"Rose City\" because of the colour of the sandstone from which it is carved.[5] The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[6]\n\nThe area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[7] and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century BC.[7][8] The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue.[7][9] Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.\n\nPetra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10] Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea.[11] Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.[12]\n\nUNESCO has described Petra as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\".[13] Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.[14]\n\nBy 7000 BC, some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in Beidha, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement just north of Petra.[7]\n\nPetra is listed in Egyptian campaign accounts and the Amarna letters as Pel, Sela, or Seir.[15]\n\nThe Iron Age lasted between 1200 and 600 BC; in that time, the Petra area was occupied by the Edomites. The configuration of mountains in Petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the Edomites. This made Petra a stopping ground for merchants, making it an outstanding area for trade. Things that were traded here included wines, olive oil, and wood.\n\nInitially, the Edomites were accompanied by Nomads who eventually left, but the Edomites stayed and made their mark on Petra before the emergence of the Nabataens. It is said that 10,000 men were thrown off of the mountain Umm el-Biyara, but this story has been debated by scholars.[16]\n\nThe Edomite site excavated at the top of the Umm el-Biyara mountain at Petra was established no earlier than the seventh century BC (Iron II).[17]\n\nThe Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water.[18] Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in Aramaic culture, theories about them having Aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern Arabian tribe.[19] Current evidence suggests that the Nabataean name for Petra was Raqēmō, variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm.[4]\n\nThe Jewish historian Josephus (ca. 37–100 AD) writes that the region was inhabited by the Midianites during the time of Moses, and that they were ruled by five kings, one of whom was Rekem. Josephus mentions that the city, called Petra by the Greeks, \"ranks highest in the land of the Arabs\" and was still called Rekeme by all the Arabs of his time, after its royal founder (Antiquities iv. 7, 1; 4, 7).[20] The Onomasticon of Eusebius also identified Rekem as Petra.[21] Arabic raqama means \"to mark, to decorate\", so Rekeme could be a Nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock façades. In 1964, workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in Nabatean script. One of them was to a certain Petraios who was born in Raqmu (Rekem) and buried in Garshu (Jerash).[22][23]\n\nAn old theory held that Petra might be identified with a place called sela in the Hebrew Bible. Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) states that the Semitic name of the city, if not Sela, would remain unknown. It nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means \"rock\" in Hebrew, and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of Obadiah. It is possible that the city was part of the nation of Edom.[24]\n\nThe passage in Diodorus Siculus (xix. 94–97) which describes the expeditions which Antigonus sent against the Nabataeans in 312 BC, was understood by some researchers to throw some light upon the history of Petra, but the \"petra\" (Greek for rock) referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name, and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time.[24][25]\n\nIn AD 106, when Cornelius Palma was governor of Syria, the part of Arabia under the rule of Petra was absorbed into the Roman Empire as part of Arabia Petraea, and Petra became its capital.[26] The native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under Roman rule. It was around this time that the Petra Roman Road was built. A century later, in the time of Alexander Severus, when the city was at the height of its splendor, the issue of coinage came to an end. There was no more building of sumptuous tombs, owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe, such as an invasion by the neo-Persian power under the Sassanid Empire.[24]\n\nMeanwhile, as Palmyra (fl. 130–270) grew in importance and attracted the Arabian trade away from Petra, the latter declined. It appears, however, to have lingered on as a religious center. Another Roman road was constructed at the site. Epiphanius of Salamis (c.315–403) writes that in his time a feast was held there on December 25 in honor of the virgin Khaabou (Chaabou) and her offspring Dushara.[24] Dushara and al-Uzza were two of the main deities of the city, which otherwise included many idols from other Nabataean deities such as Allat and Manat.[27]\n\nBetween 111 and 114 Trajan built the Via Traiana Nova, running from the Syrian border to the Red Sea through Petra. This road followed the old routes of Nabataean caravans. In the shadow of the Pax Romana, this route revived trade between Arabia, Syria, and Mediterranean harbors. In 125 AD, one of Emperor Hadrian's administrators left marks[dubious – discuss] in Petra, pointed out by documents found at the Dead Sea. In 130 AD, Hadrian visited the former Nabataean capital, giving it the name of Hadriānī Petra Metropolis, imprinted on his coins. His visit, however, did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in Jerash. The province's governor, Sextius Florentinus, erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al-Hubta (King's Wall) tombs, which had been generally reserved during the Nabataean period for the royal family.\n\nThe interest that Roman emperors showed in the city in the 3rd century suggests that Petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time. An inscription to Liber Pater, a god revered by Emperor Septimius Severus, was found in the temenos of the temple known as Qasr al-Bint, and Nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor's portrait, as well as pottery from his reign. Emperor Elagabalus declared Petra to be a Roman colony, when he reorganized the Roman Empire towards the end of the 3rd century.[28] The area from Petra to Wadi Mujib, the Negev, and the Sinai Peninsula were annexed into the province of Palaestina Salutaris. Petra may be seen on the Madaba mosaic map from the reign of Emperor Justinian.\n\nPetra declined rapidly under Roman rule, in large part from the revision of sea-based trade routes. In 363, an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system.[29] The old city of Petra was the capital of the Byzantine province of Palaestina III and many churches from the Byzantine period were excavated in and around Petra. In one of them, the Byzantine Church, 140 papyri were discovered, which contained mainly contracts dated from 530s to 590s, establishing that the city was still flourishing in the 6th century.[30] The Byzantine Church is a prime example of monumental architecture in Byzantine Petra.\n\nThe last reference to Byzantine Petra comes from the Spiritual Meadow of John Moschus, written in the first decades of the 7th century. He gives an anecdote about its bishop, Athenogenes. It ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before 687 when that function had been transferred to Areopolis. Petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, nor does it appear in any early Islamic records.[31]\n\nIn the 12th century, the Crusaders built fortresses such as the Alwaeira Castle, but were forced to abandon Petra after a while. As a result, the location of Petra was lost until the 19th century.[32][33]\n\nTwo further Crusader-period castles are known in and around Petra: the first is al-Wu'ayra, situated just north of Wadi Musa. It can be viewed from the road to Little Petra. It is the castle that was seized by a band of Turks with the help of local Muslims and only recovered by the Crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of Wadi Musa. The potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate a surrender. The second is on the summit of el-Habis, in the heart of Petra, and can be accessed from the West side of the Qasr al-Bint.\n\nThe ruins of Petra were an object of curiosity during the Middle Ages and were visited by Baibars, one of the first Mamluk sultans of Egypt, towards the end of the 13th century.[24]\n\nThe first European to describe them was the Swiss traveler Johann Ludwig Burckhardt during his travels in 1812.[24][34] At that time, the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem operated a diocese in al-Karak named Battra (Arabic: باطره, Ancient Greek: Πέτρας) and it was the opinion among the clergy of Jerusalem that Kerak was the ancient city of Petra.[34]\n\nBurckhardt already spoke Arabic fluently, and was on his way to explore the Niger River when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the Prophet Aaron, and became fascinated with finding the city. He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.[35]\n\nLéon de Laborde and Louis-Maurice-Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of Petra in 1828.[36] The Scottish painter David Roberts visited Petra in 1839 and returned to Britain with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes, published in The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia. Frederic Edwin Church, the leading American landscape painter of the 19th century, visited Petra in 1868, and the resulting painting El Khasné, Petra is among his most important and well-documented.[36] Missionary Archibald Forder published photographs of Petra in the December 1909 issue of National Geographic.\n\nBecause the structures weakened with age, many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves, and many treasures were stolen. In 1929, a four-person team consisting of British archaeologists Agnes Conway and George Horsfield, Palestinian physician and folklore expert Tawfiq Canaan and Ditlef Nielsen, a Danish scholar, excavated and surveyed Petra.[37]\n\nThe archaeologist Philip Hammond from the University of Utah visited Petra for nearly 40 years. He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[38]\n\nIn the 1980s, the Bedul Bedouin, once inhabitants of Petra, were relocated by the Jordanian government to the nearby settlement of Umm Sayhoun, a process spanning two decades. This move was part of broader initiatives aimed at settling Bedouin communities and promoting tourism in Petra.[39][40] With a name meaning \"the changing ones\" and oral traditions recounting a conversion narrative, the Bedul Bedouins are believed to have adopted Islam later in their history, possibly with Jewish or Nabatean origins.[41][42][43] Today, alongside their traditional activities, they engage in local tourism, alongside the more prominent Liyathnah tribe.[39]\n\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.[44]\n\nIn December 2022, Petra was hit by heavy flooding.[45]\n\nPetra is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba.[24]\n\nExcavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city, creating an artificial oasis. The area is visited by flash floods, but archaeological evidence shows that the Nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams, cisterns, and water conduits. These innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale.[46][47]\n\nIn ancient times, Petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of Petra, around Jabal Haroun (\"Aaron's Mountain\"), the location of the Tomb of Aaron, said to be the burial place of Aaron, brother of Moses. Another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north. Today, most modern visitors approach the site from the east. The impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark, narrow gorge, in places only 3–4 m (10–13 ft) wide, called the Siq (\"shaft\"), a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into Wadi Musa.[48]\n\nPetra is known primarily for its Hellenistic architecture. The facades of the tombs in Petra are commonly rendered in Hellenistic style, reflecting the number of diverse cultures with which the Nabataeans traded, all of which were in turn influenced by Greek culture. Most of these tombs contain small burials niches carved into the stone.[49]\n\nPerhaps the best example of the Hellenistic style is seen in the Treasury, which is 24 meters (79 ft) wide and 37 meters (121 ft) tall and refers to the architecture of Alexandria.[50] The facade of the Treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside, and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top. Near the bottom of the Treasury are the twin Greek gods Castor and Pollux, who protect travellers on their journeys. Near the top of the Treasury, two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos. This female figure is believed to be the Isis-Tyche, Isis and Tyche being the Egyptian and Greek goddesses, respectively, of good fortune.[49]\n\nAnother prime example of Hellenistic architecture featured in Petra is its Monastery, which stands at 45 meters (148 ft) tall and 50 meters (160 ft) wide; this is Petra's largest monument and is similarly carved into the rock face. The facade of this again features a broken pediment, similar to the Treasury, as well as another central tholos. The Monastery displays more of a Nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from Greek architecture.[49] Its only source of light is its entrance standing at 8 meters (26 ft) high. There is a large space outside of the Monastery, which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes. Formerly, in the Byzantine period, this was a place for Christian worship, but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit.\n\nAt the end of the narrow gorge, the Siq, stands Petra's most elaborate ruin, popularly known as Al-Khazneh (\"the Treasury\"), hewn into the sandstone cliff. While remaining in remarkably preserved condition, the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local Bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it.[48] A little farther from the Treasury, at the foot of the mountain called en-Nejr, is a massive theatre, positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view. At the point where the valley opens out into the plain, the site of the city is revealed with striking effect. The theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction. Rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible. Almost enclosing it on three sides are rose-coloured mountain walls, divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers.[24] The theatre was said to hold around 8,500 people.[51] The performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas. Gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience, although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it. The theatre was one of many structures in Petra that took significant damage due to the 363 Galilee earthquake.[51]\n\nThe Petra Pool and Garden Complex is a series of structures within the city center. Originally said to be a market area,[52] excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate Nabataean garden, which included a large swimming pool, an island-pavilion, and an intricate hydraulic system.[53][54][55]\n\nAhead of the Petra Pool and Garden Complex lies Colonnaded street, which is among few artifacts of Petra that was constructed rather than natural. This street used to hold a semi-circle nymphaeum, which is now in ruins due to flash flooding, and used to hold Petra's only tree. This was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the Nabataens were able to construct in Petra. Once the Romans took control of the city, Colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk, and 72 columns were added to each side.[56]\n\nThe High Place of Sacrifice is perched atop Jebel Madbah Mountain.[57] The beginning of the hike is near Petra's theatre. From there, the site of The High Place of Sacrifice is around an 800-step hike. One commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation. Another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice; this is due to the belief that the tomb of the Prophet Aaron is located in Petra, which is a sacred site for Muslims. In honor of this, a goat was sacrificed annually. Other rituals also took place there, including the burning of frankincense.[58]\n\nThe Royal Tombs of Petra are in the Nabatean version of Hellenistic architecture, but their facades have worn due to natural decay. One of these tombs, the Palace Tomb, is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of Petra. The Corinthian Tomb, which is right next to the Palace Tomb, has the same Hellenistic architecture featured on the Treasury. The two other Royal Tombs are the Silk Tomb and the Urn Tomb; the Silk Tomb does not stand out as much as the Urn Tomb. The Urn Tomb features a large yard in its front, and was turned into a church in 446 AD after the expansion of Christianity.[59]\n\nIn 2016, archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large, previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about 150 BC, the time when the Nabataeans initiated their public building programme. It is located outside the main area of the city, at the foot of Jabal an-Nmayr and about 0.5 mi (0.8 km) south of the city centre, but is facing east, not towards the city, and has no visible relationship to it. The structure consists of a huge, 184 by 161 ft (56 by 49 m) platform, with a monumental staircase along its eastern side. The large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one, topped with a comparatively small building, 28 by 28 ft (8.5 by 8.5 m), which was facing east toward the staircase. The structure, second in size only to the Monastery complex, probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers.[60][61][62]\n\nPliny the Elder and other writers identify Petra as the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade. Enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream, Petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress, but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to Gaza in the west, to Bosra and Damascus in the north, to Aqaba and Leuce Come on the Red Sea, and across the desert to the Persian Gulf.[24]\n\nThe Nabataeans worshipped Arab gods and goddesses during the pre-Islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings. One, Obodas I, was deified after his death in 85 BC. Dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities: Al-‘Uzzā, Allat and Manāt. Many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses. New evidence indicates that broader Edomite, and Nabataean theology had strong links to Earth-Sun relationships, often manifested in the orientation of prominent Petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets.[63]\n\nA stele dedicated to Qos-Allah 'Qos is Allah' or 'Qos the god', by Qosmilk (melech: king) is found at Petra (Glueck 516). Qos is identifiable with Kaush (Qaush) the God of the older Edomites. The stele is horned and the seal from the Edomite Tawilan near Petra identified with Kaush displays a star and crescent (Browning 28), both consistent with a moon deity. It is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with Harran (Bartlett 194). There is continuing debate about the nature of Qos (qaus: bow) who has been identified both with a hunting bow (hunting god) and a rainbow (weather god) although the crescent above the stele is also a bow.[citation needed]\n\nNabataean inscriptions in Sinai and other places display widespread references to names including Allah, El and Allat (god and goddess), with regional references to al-Uzza, Baal and Manutu (Manat) (Negev 11). Allat is also found in Sinai in South Arabian language. Allah occurs particularly as Garm-'allahi: \"god decided\" (Greek Garamelos) and Aush-allahi: \"gods covenant\" (Greek Ausallos). We find both Shalm-lahi \"Allah is peace\" and Shalm-allat, \"the peace of the goddess\". We also find Amat-allahi \"she-servant of god\" and Halaf-llahi \"the successor of Allah\".[64]\n\nRecently, Petra has been put forward as the original direction of Muslim prayer, the Qibla, by some that the earliest mosques faced Petra, not Jerusalem or Mecca.[65] This view is also shared by Abdullah Hashem, the self-proclaimed Qa'im of the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light.[66] However, others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of Qiblah directions to early mosques’ Qiblahs as they claim early Muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the Qiblah to Mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of Petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental.[67]\n\nThe Monastery, Petra's largest monument, dates from the 1st century BC. It was dedicated to Obodas I and is believed to be the symposium of Obodas the god. This information is inscribed on the ruins of the Monastery (the name is the translation of the Arabic Ad Deir).[citation needed]\n\nThe Temple of the Winged Lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of King Aretas IV (9 BC–40 AD). The temple is located in Petra's so-called Sacred Quarter, an area situated at the end of Petra's main Colonnaded Street consisting of two majestic temples, the Qasr al-Bint and, opposite, the Temple of the Winged Lions on the northern bank of Wadi Musa.\n\nChristianity found its way to Petra in the 4th century AD, nearly 500 years after the establishment of Petra as a trade centre. The start of Christianity in Petra started primarily in 330 AD when the first Christian Emperor of Rome took over, Constantine I, otherwise known as Constantine The Great. He began the initial spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. Athanasius mentions a bishop of Petra (Antioch. 10) named Asterius. At least one of the tombs (the \"tomb with the urn\"?) was used as a church. An inscription in red paint records its consecration \"in the time of the most holy bishop Jason\" (447). After the Islamic conquest of 629–632, Christianity in Petra, as of most of Arabia, gave way to Islam. During the First Crusade Petra was occupied by Baldwin I of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of Al Karak (in the lordship of Oultrejordain) with the title Château de la Valée de Moyse or Sela. It remained in the hands of the Franks until 1189.[24] It is still a titular see of the Catholic Church.[68]\n\nAccording to Arab tradition, Petra is the spot where Musa (Moses) struck a rock with his staff and water came forth, and where Moses' brother, Harun (Aaron), is buried, at Mount Hor, known today as Jabal Haroun or Mount Aaron. The Wadi Musa or \"Wadi of Moses\" is the Arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which Petra is sited. A mountaintop shrine of Moses' sister Miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of Jerome in the 4th century, but its location has not been identified since.[69]\n\nIn Petra, there is a semi-arid climate. Most rain falls in the winter. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is BSk. The average annual temperature in Petra is 15.5 °C (59.9 °F). About 193 mm (7.60 in) of precipitation falls annually.\n\nThe Bedul (Petra Bedouin) were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in Petra to Umm Sayhoun/Um Seihun by the Jordanian government in 1985, prior to the UNESCO designation process.[39][40] They were provided with block-built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system. Among the six communities in the Petra Region, Umm Sayhoun is one of the smaller communities. The village of Wadi Musa is the largest in the area, inhabited largely by the Layathnah Bedouin, and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre, the main entrance via the Siq and the archaeological site generally. Umm Sayhoun gives access to the 'back route' into the site, the Wadi Turkmaniyeh pedestrian route.[70]\n\nOn December 6, 1985, Petra was designated a World Heritage Site. In a popular poll in 2007, it was also named one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in August 2007.[71]\n\nThe Bedoul belong to one of the Bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by UNESCO on the Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2005 and inscribed[72] in 2008.\n\nIn 2011, following an 11-month project planning phase, the Petra Development and Tourism Region Authority in association with DesignWorkshop and JCP s.r.l published a Strategic Master Plan that guides planned development of the Petra Region. This is intended to guide planned development of the Petra Region in an efficient, balanced and sustainable way over the next 20 years for the benefit of the local population and of Jordan in general. As part of this, a Strategic Plan was developed for Umm Sayhoun and surrounding areas.[73]\n\nThe process of developing the Strategic Plan considered the area's needs from five points of view:\n\nThe site suffers from a host of threats, including collapse of ancient structures, erosion due to flooding and improper rainwater drainage, weathering from salt upwelling,[74] improper restoration of ancient structures, and unsustainable tourism.[75] The last has increased substantially, especially since the site received widespread media coverage in 2007 during the New7Wonders of the World Internet and cellphone campaign.[76] Tourism has steadily grown, with Petra receiving 1.2 million total visitors in 2019.[77]\n\nIn an attempt to reduce the problems, the Petra National Trust (PNT) was established in 1989. It has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection, conservation, and preservation of the Petra site.[78] Moreover, UNESCO and ICOMOS recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive World Heritage sites. They chose Petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes. The presentation Tourism and Archaeological Heritage Management at Petra: Driver to Development or Destruction? (2012) was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings, cities, sites, and regions.[79]\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) released a video in 2018 highlighting the abuse of working animals in Petra. PETA claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day. The video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals, with beatings intensifying when animals faltered. PETA also showed some wounded animals, including camels with fly-infested, open wounds.[80] The Jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinary clinic, and by undertaking to spread awareness among animal handlers.[81] In 2020, more video released by PETA indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and, in 2021, the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area.[82][83]\n\nPetra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape. Ever since Johann Ludwig Burckhardt[84] aka Sheikh Ibrahim had re-discovered the ruin city in Petra, Jordan, in 1812, the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the Nabataeans such as travellers, pilgrims, painters and savants.[85] However, it was not until the late 19th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers.[86] Since then regular archaeological excavations[87] and ongoing research on the Nabataean culture have been part of today's UNESCO world cultural heritage site Petra.[88] Through the excavations in the Petra Archaeological Park an increasing number of Nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact. A central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades.[89] The large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage, as especially this connection is a central challenge at the UNECSO World Heritage Site.[90]\n\nIn recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of Petra.[91] The main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the Siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access. Also, different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted. Following is a list of projects, to be continued.\n• 1958 Restoration of the third pillar of the Treasury building (Al-Khazneh). This project was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)\n• 1974–1990 Conservation work in the excavated area of the Winged Lions Temple\n• 1981 Different restoration works by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan 92\n• 1985 Restoration works at the Qasr El Bint Temple by the Department of Antiquities of Jordan 93\n• 1990–1998 Excavation and Conservation of the Byzantine Church by the American Centre of Research (ACOR)\n• 1993–2000 Excavation, conservation and restoration of the Great Temple, funded by the Brown University, USA. 94\n• 1996 onwards, Restoration of the Siq and rehabilitation of the Siq floor by the Petra National Trust foundet by the Jordanian-Swiss counterpart Fund, the Swiss Agency for Development and the World Monuments Fund. 95\n• 2001 Restoration of the altar in front of the Casr Bint Firaun by UNESCO\n• 2003 Development of a conservation and maintenance plan of the ancient drainage systems to protect the rock-cut facades 89\n• 2003–2017 Evaluation of desalination and restoration at the tomb facades 96\n• 2006–2010 Preservation and consolidation of the Wall Paintings in Siq al Barid by the Petra National Trust in cooperation with the Department of Antiquities of Jordan and the Courtauld Institute of Art (London).\n• 2009 onwards, renewed effort to preserve and rehabilitate the Winged Lions Temple by The Temple of the Winged Lions Cultural Management (TWLCRM) Initiative, the Petra Archaeological Park (PAP) and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan\n• 2016–2019 Characterisation and Conservation of Paintings on Walls and Sculpture from Nabataean Petra \"The Petra Painting Conservation Project (PPCP)\", 97 funded by the German Research Foundation (Project number 285789434). 98\n• In 1845, British poet John William Burgon won Oxford University's Newdigate Prize for his poem \"Petra\", containing the description \"...a rose-red city half as old as time\".\n• Petra appeared in the novels Bartleby; Left Behind Series; Appointment with Death; The Eagle in the Sand; The Red Sea Sharks, the nineteenth book in The Adventures of Tintin series; and in Kingsbury's The Moon Goddess and the Son.

It was characterized by the restoration of the conditions prevailing before the Prague Spring reform period led by the First Secretary Alexander Dubček of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) earlier in 1968 and the subsequent preservation of the new status quo. Some historians date the period from the signing of the Moscow Protocol by Dubček and the other jailed Czechoslovak leaders on 26 August 1968,[1] while others date it from the replacement of Dubček by Gustáv Husák on 17 April 1969, followed by the official normalization policies referred to as Husakism. The policy ended either with Husák's removal as leader of the Party on 17 December 1987, or with the beginning of the Velvet Revolution on 17 November 1989, which would see the resignation of the entire Communist Party leadership within a week and an end to Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.\n\nWhen Husák replaced Dubček as leader of the KSČ in April 1969, his regime acted quickly to ‘normalize’ the country's political situation. The chief objectives of Husák's normalization were the restoration of firm party rule and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia's status as a committed member of the socialist bloc. The normalization process involved five interrelated steps:\n• revoke or modify the laws enacted by the reform movement;\n• reinstate the power of police authorities; and\n\nWithin a week of assuming power, Husák began to consolidate his leadership by ordering extensive purges of reformists still occupying key positions in the mass media, judiciary, social and mass organizations, lower party organs, and, finally, the highest levels of the KSČ. In the fall of 1969, twenty-nine liberals on the Central Committee of the KSČ were replaced by conservatives. Among the liberals ousted was Dubček, who was dropped from the Presidium (the following year Dubček was expelled from the party; he subsequently became a minor functionary in Slovakia). Husák also consolidated his leadership by appointing potential rivals to the new government positions created as a result of the 1968 Constitutional Law of Federation (which created the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic).\n\nOnce it had consolidated power, the regime moved quickly to implement other normalization policies. In the two years following the invasion, the new leadership revoked some reformist laws (such as the National Front Act and the Press Act) and simply did not enforce others. It returned economic enterprises, which had been given substantial independence during the Prague Spring, to centralized control through contracts based on central planning and production quotas. It reinstated extreme police control, a step that was reflected in the harsh treatment of demonstrators marking the first anniversary of the August intervention.\n\nFinally, Husák stabilized Czechoslovakia's relations with its allies by arranging frequent intrabloc exchanges and visits and redirecting Czechoslovakia's foreign economic ties toward greater involvement with socialist nations.\n\nBy May 1971, Husák could report to the delegates attending the officially sanctioned Fourteenth Party Congress that the process of normalization had been completed satisfactorily and that Czechoslovakia was ready to proceed toward higher forms of socialism.\n\nThe method by which the KSČ under Husák ruled was commonly summed up as ‘reluctant terror.’ It involved careful adherence to the Soviet Union's policy objectives and the use of what was perceived as the minimum amount of repression at home necessary to fulfill these objectives and prevent a return to Dubček-style reformism. The result was a regime that, while not a complete return to Stalinism, was far from being a liberal one either.\n\nThe membership of the KSČ's Presidium changed very little after 1971. The Sixteenth Party Congress in 1981 reelected the incumbent members of the Presidium and Secretariat and elevated one candidate member, Miloš Jakeš, to full membership in the Presidium. The Seventeenth Party Congress in 1986 retained the incumbent Secretariat and Presidium and added three new candidate members to the Presidium. In March 1987, Josef Korčák retired from the Presidium and was replaced by Ladislav Adamec. At the same time, Hoffman, a Presidium member, was also appointed a Central Committee secretary. In December 1987, Husák was forced to retire, and Jakeš became general secretary of the KSČ.\n\nPopular control during this era of orthodoxy was maintained through various means. Repeated arrests and imprisonment of persons opposing the regime, such as members of Charter 77 and religious activists, continued throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. Less coercive controls, such as punishment through job loss, demotion, denial of employment, denial of educational opportunities, housing restrictions, and refusal to grant travel requests, also prevailed. The level of repression increased over the years as Husák grew more conservative, and in the cultural realm sometimes approached the levels seen in Erich Honecker's East Germany and even Nicolae Ceauşescu's Romania.\n\nAnother means by which the Husák regime maintained control was to offer considerable consumer gains as a substitute for the loss of personal freedom. Government policies in the first half of the 1970s resulted in high economic growth and large increases in personal consumption. The widespread availability of material goods placated the general populace and promoted overall acceptance of Husák's stringent political controls. During the late 1970s, however, Czechoslovakia's economy began to stagnate, and the regime's ability to appease the population by providing material benefits diminished.\n\nAlthough the Husák regime succeeded in preserving the status quo in Czechoslovakia for nearly two decades, the 1980s brought internal and external pressures to reform. Domestically, poor economic performance hindered the government's ability to produce the goods needed to satisfy consumer demands. Pressure for political change continued from activists representing, for example, the Roman Catholic Church and the Charter 77 movement. Externally, Czechoslovakia struggled to find a suitable response to the changes introduced by the new leadership in Moscow under Mikhail Gorbachev. Czechoslovakia's initial (1985–1987) response to the reformist trends in the Soviet Union focused on voicing public support for Gorbachev's new programs while steadfastly avoiding introducing similar programs within Czechoslovakia. In April 1987, Husák finally announced a half-hearted program of reform starting in 1991, but it was too late.\n\nA remarkable feature of the KSČ leadership under Husák was the absence of significant changes in personnel. The stability of the leadership during the late 1970s and the first half of the 1980s could be attributed not to unanimity in political opinion but rather to practical compromise among different factions vying to retain their leadership positions. Husák's leadership, then, was based not on any ability he may have had to rally opinion but rather on his skill in securing consensuses that were in the mutual interest of a coalition of party leaders. After the 1968 invasion, Husák successfully ruled over what was essentially a coalition of the conservative and hard-line factions within the top party leadership. (see KSČ-History for details)\n\nThe official objectives of normalization (in the narrower sense) were the restoration of firm KSČ rule and the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia's position in the socialist bloc. Its result, however, was a political environment that placed primary emphasis on the maintenance of a stable party leadership and its strict control over the population.\n\nThe absence of popular support for the Husák leadership was an inevitable reaction to the repressive policies instituted during the normalization process. Early post-invasion efforts to keep alive the spirit of the Prague Spring were quashed through a series of subversion trials in 1972 that led to jail sentences ranging from nine months to six and one-half years for the opposition leaders. Czechoslovak citizens over the age of fifteen were required to carry a small red identification book, containing an array of information about the individual and a number of pages to be stamped by employers, health officials, and other authorities. All citizens also had permanent files at the office of their local KSČ neighborhood committee, another at their place of employment, and another at the Ministry of Interior.\n\nThe most common attitudes toward political activity since the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion have been apathy, passivity, and escapism. For the most part, citizens of Czechoslovakia retreated from public political concern during the 1970s into the pursuit of the private pleasures of consumerism. Individuals sought the material goods that remained available during the 1970s, such as new automobiles, houses in the country, household appliances, and access to sporting events and entertainment. As long as these consumer demands were met, the populace for the most part tolerated the stagnant political climate.\n\nAnother symptom of the political malaise during the 1970s was the appearance of various forms of antisocial behavior. Petty theft and wanton destruction of public property reportedly were widespread. Alcoholism, already at levels that alarmed officials, increased; absenteeism and declining worker discipline affected productivity; and emigration, the ultimate expression of alienation, surpassed 100,000 during the 1970s.\n\nCzech philosophers Václav Bělohradský and Stanislav Komárek use the term ‘neonormalization’ (neonormalizace) for a stage of Czech society in the post-communist period, which is compared with the torpidity and hypocrisy of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBělohradský in his book Společnost nevolnosti (Slon, 2007) calls ‘neonormalization’ the direction since 1992 that all alternative opinions are crowded out, a culture shifts into the trash of entertainers, next the deepening of democracy is blocked, the public space is infested with right-wing ideology and Czech Republic participated in all sorts of nefarious wars.\n\nKomárek, a philosopher and biologist, in many his articles since 2006[2] popularizes his opinion that in certain stages of society development, the administrative and formalistic aspect (or the ‘power of mediocres’) outweighs a common sense, creativity and utility.[3] Pressure for conformity intensely rises and everyone is obliged to \"sell his soul\" to keep up in social structures.[4] This neonormalistic period in the Czech Republic began ‘after 20 years of freedom’, it means about in 2010 year, in Komárek's view.[4]\n\nThis term is discussed and used by many other authors.[5]\n\nThis article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.Art Devo 1973-1977: Futurismo present a standard LP version of DEVO’s highly celebrated and sold-out box set release - ART DEVO 1973-1977. Now available as a 3xLP in a new limited colour 'Space Junk'.\n\nThe release all hardcore Devo fans have been waiting for, ART DEVO is a vital collection housing unheard and obscure mind blowers sourced directly from the vaults of The De-Evolution Band. This anthology takes you from the band's initial conception in Akron, Ohio to the moment before the world woke up, in a collection of sonic and visual art that captures Devo at the dawn of industrial death.\n\nIn honour of their 50th Anniversary, ART DEVO showcases the mesmerizing evolution of a band on the brink of discovery, mining irony, wit and dark humour from the madness of a distorted modern world still coming to terms with aftermath of a collapsed economy and the Vietnam war. From 1973-1977 Devo would transform from an art project, pop art in the literal sense, into the group David Bowie would declare “the band of the future”. Here you will find the audio mutations of a band at the edge of greatness, initial concepts that gave birth to a new aesthetic that continually challenged preconceptions about music, art, performance, culture, composition and consumption...it was also the birth of Booji Boy. While the songs here may not be fully grown, raw even, these are the seeds of subversion that kickstarted Devo’s fifty year legacy.\n\nSpanning 3xLP’s almost completely unheard and unreleased material, this collection draws purely from that integral early history, garnered from unearthed basement recordings, original demo tapes, unfinished montages and rare live audio, all taken from the band's personal archive. This collection showcases why Devo was, and is still is, one of the most important bands in American history. De-evolution is real. The art of DEVO is real. Here is the evidence.\n\nThis 3xLP version is housed in a gloss laminated wide spined sleeve, it comes in a choice of limited edition vinyl colours, it has a tracklist that has been curated by the band, and contains a fold-out poster containing rare imagery and liner notes by Mark Mothersbaugh and Gerald V Casale.Archival 1973-1977, by: Get fresh music recommendations delivered to your inbox every Friday.North American Hockey League (1973–1977) - Wikipedia: The North American Hockey League (NAHL) was a low-level minor professional ice hockey league that existed from 1973 to 1977. Several of the NAHL teams operated as developmental (\"farm\") teams for World Hockey Association franchises. The NAHL was one of two leagues, along with the Southern Hockey League, that were formed after the Eastern Hockey League ceased operations in 1973. The Lockhart Cup was the league's championship trophy. With the loss of a number of franchises and financial struggles, the NAHL folded in September 1977.[1][2]\n\nThe championship trophy of the North American Hockey League was named the Lockhart Cup in honor of Tommy Lockhart, founder of the Eastern Hockey League. The trophy was last awarded on April 10, 1977, to the Syracuse Blazers, and has since gone missing. The Hockey Hall of Fame stated that the Lockhart Cup is one of \"about three historical trophies that have disappeared\".[3] Its last known whereabouts was reported to be in the basement of Danny Belisle, the coach of the Blazers in the 1976–77 season.[3]\n\nIn September 1977 the league folded. It had been struggling financially. The league by then consisted of five teams, after the Syracuse team folded in 1976 after winning the league championship. The league had discussed continuing with five teams, but the Utica team was in dire straits would have to have been carried by the other four teams. Each would have had to post $50,000 to keep the league alive. The Binghamton and Philadelphia teams declined. Due to the closing of the league, all the players were released outright from their contracts.[2]\n\nThe league served as the inspiration for the film Slap Shot.[4] Ned Dowd, who played for the Johnstown Jets,[5] was the brother of the film's screenwriter, Nancy Dowd. Ned played for Johnstown during a season where the team was for sale, when his sister came to live in Johnstown and was inspired to write the screenplay. The film contains references to \"Syracuse\" and \"Broome County\", which were teams in the NAHL.[6] Some of the incidents depicted actually occurred in actual NAHL games.[4]Reddit - Dive into anything: By continuing, you agree to our User Agreement and acknowledge that you understand the Privacy Policy."}

His films often combine a humanistic view of the world with sarcasm and provocative cinematography.[2] Some of these films are adapted from works by Czech writers such as Bohumil Hrabal and Vladislav Vančura.[3][4]\n\nMenzel was born in Prague in 1938 to Josef Menzel and Božena Jindřichová.[5] His father Josef was a journalist, translator and children's book writer.[6] Menzel studied directing at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) in Prague. His teachers at the academy included Czech Director Otakar Vávra.[7]\n\nMenzel was a member of the Czech New Wave cinema in the 1960s. His first feature film, Closely Watched Trains, won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1967.[8][2] The film was a World War II drama based on a book by Bohumil Hrabal.[4] His film Larks on a String was filmed in 1969, but was banned by the government censors. It was finally released in 1990 after the fall of the Communist regime. The film won the Golden Bear at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival in 1990.[9] The film was also based on a book by Bohumil Hrabal, and spoke about life in a re-education camp in Czechoslovakia under the communist rule in the 1950s.[4][10]\n\nMenzel was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film again in 1986 with his dark comedy My Sweet Little Village.[11] In 1987, he was a member of the jury at the 37th Berlin International Film Festival.[12] In 1989 he was a member of the jury at the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.[13] In 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.[14] He was awarded an IIFA Lifetime Achievement Award in November 2013.[15] He was also awarded the French title of Knight of Arts and Letters and the Czech Lion for lifetime artistic contribution.[4][10]\n\nIn the 1980s he was offered by a West German television studio to make a television series version of The Good Soldier Švejk with Rudolf Hrušínský. He didn't get the permission from the Czechoslovak government however.[16]\n\nHis last appearance in a feature film was in the 2018 Slovak film, The Interpreter, which was based on the story of a man's interactions with an SS soldier who had executed his parents. The film was Slovakia's official entry to the Oscars.[10][17]\n\nMenzel died on 5 September 2020, aged 82, after battling a prolonged illness.[18] He had undergone a brain surgery earlier in 2017.[10] He is survived by his wife Olga Menzelová, and daughters, Anna Karolina and Eva Maria.[4][18] Menzel's wife confirmed on 9 November 2020 that Menzel died as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia.[19][20]\n• The Woman Across the Way (1978) 25\n• Tale of the Little Quarter (TV Movie)(1981) 25\n• All My Loved Ones (1999) 25Jiří Menzel obituary: The film Closely Observed Trains, made in 1966, is a quietly subversive comedy, beautifully shot in crisp black-and-white, in which a workshy young guard at a remote train station in Czechoslovakia during the second world war is more concerned with losing his virginity than with throwing in his lot with either the occupying German forces or the resistance fighters.\n\nIt was directed with a charmingly light touch by Jiří Menzel, who has died aged 82 after a long illness. It established the simple rural milieu to which he would return repeatedly throughout his career and showed in its gently searching way that the personal can never be divorced from the political.\n\nThe film was a key work of the Czech new wave, and won the Academy Award for best foreign language film in 1968. During the Oscars telecast, Menzel was wrongly identified by the announcer, who mistook him for the Serbian director Aleksandar Petrović. Once on stage, he gave a nine-word acceptance speech (“I am very happy that Americans like Czech film”) before being escorted away by Danny Kaye. It resembled a scene from one of the director’s own absurdist, understated comedies.\n\nTwo years after Closely Observed Trains, Menzel made the equally delightful Capricious Summer (1968), which exuded a warming mix of nostalgia, whimsy and insight.\n\nBut he had little time to capitalise on his Oscar success. Four months after the ceremony, Russian tanks rolled into Prague and his career was, as he put it, “derailed”. While compatriots such as Miloš Forman and Ivan Passer fled to the US, Menzel stayed put. “I was the first Czech film-maker prevented from working and was only able to return to film-making in 1974,” he said. “It was only after some years and several more films that I felt I had returned to a position of prestige.” He kept himself busy directing theatre and acted prolifically in film and television.\n\nBorn in Prague, he was the son of Josef Menzel, a writer and translator, and Božena (nee Jindrichová), and grew up during the occupation. “As a five-year-old boy I remember being forced to do the Nazi Sieg Heil salute on the street,” he said. “I raised my left rather than right hand and my mother had to correct me.”\n\nHe had ambitions to be an actor but was rejected from drama school and ended up working in television and then studying at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU), where he met the director Vera Chytilová, among others; in 1963, he was an assistant on her film Something Different.\n\nMenzel and Chytilová were among five film-makers who adapted short stories by the Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal for the portmanteau feature Pearls of the Deep (1965). Menzel and Hrabal became friends and worked together, adapting Closely Observed Trains from the writer’s autobiographical novel. Menzel also turned Hrabal’s Larks on a String into a 1969 film, which was banned by the communist government for its portrait of bourgeois Czechs forced into re-education. It remained unreleased until 1990, when it was the joint winner of the Golden Bear prize at the Berlin film festival.\n\nThey also collaborated on the screenplays of Shortcuts (1981) and The Snowdrop Festivities (1984), both of which exhibited Menzel’s characteristic nostalgia for the ease of country life.\n\nThey shared a humane and inquisitive worldview. “Hrabal’s [perspective] influenced my own ideas about art a great deal,” he said. “I always admired in Hrabal the ability to look at people and see them as they truly are, with a truly uncompromising perspective, but he still loved people. He wasn’t a misanthrope after all that.”\n\nNot all of Menzel’s films were known outside his home country, but My Sweet Little Village (1985), which was seen by more than a million Czechoslovakian cinemagoers, put him in the running for the Oscar for best foreign language film for the second time in his career, while his gentle satire The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin (1994) received international distribution.\n\nLike the film that had made his name, this was another tale of a mild-mannered innocent falling in love in a remote location. In its occasional outbreaks of slapstick, it displayed the director’s enduring love for the comedy of silent and early sound cinema.\n\nHe brought echoes of Chaplin also to I Served the King of England (2006), another adaptation of Hrabal’s work. Reviewing that movie, the New Yorker critic David Denby identified similarities between the film’s faintly bumbling hero, its Czech setting and Menzel himself. “The small country, like the small man, gets pushed around by bullies but survives through instinct and guile. It’s as if Menzel were celebrating not only Czech identity after the murderous 20th century but his own cunning and perseverance as an artist.”\n\nThough Menzel made only one more picture, The Don Juans (2013), he was the subject in 2018 of a seven-and-a-half-hour documentary, CzechMate: In Search of Jiří Menzel, which took its director Shivendra Singh Dungarpur eight years to complete and highlighted Menzel’s influence as well as his famous charm and decency.\n\n“I only want to have one small ‘bourgeois’ theme – that being decent can be beautiful,” he said in 1987. Cinema, he insisted, could play its part in that. “People have such depressing lives that in films they should be stroked a little bit. One should help them a little bit to hold their heads up high.”\n\nHe is survived by his wife, the producer Olga Menzelová, whom he married in 2004, and their daughters, Anna Karolina and Eva Maria.Work and the New Wave: On My Capricious Summer with Jiří Menzel: ON JULY 5, I feel like I am crawling out of my skin.\n\nI am waiting on edits, waiting on invoices, waiting on responses to pitches, waiting on replies to follow-ups. All I want at that moment is to feel like a productive freelance journalist, and my ability to do and be that is out of my hands. In the grand scheme of problems, this does not even register. But on July 5, it feels like it does.\n\nSome friends tell me to scream into a pillow or go for a run or take a nap. I decide to do something along those lines but different: I commit myself to watching every feature film ever made by the late Czech director Jiří Menzel, who was born in Prague in 1938 and died in that same city three years ago this September.\n\nI have only ever seen one of his movies: Larks on a String, which was shot in 1969 but went unreleased for political reasons until 1990, and which I watched in a Slavic cultures class in college and vaguely remember enjoying.\n\nAs film fate would have it, I have a one-month subscription to the website Eastern European Movies, and it looks like that site has over half of his movies (not counting short films or those made for television). That means I can probably track down every feature film he directed, I tell myself.\n\nThere are, by my count, 19 feature films, including Pearls of the Deep (1966), a Czech New Wave manifesto, which is a series of short films, each bringing to life a short story by writer Bohumil Hrabal, the first of which Menzel directed; and Ten Minutes Older: The Cello (2002), also a collection of short films. That seems like an impressive but manageable number. Any time I feel professionally frustrated or helpless, I tell myself, I will watch one of his movies.\n\nThe first Menzel movie I tackle is Closely Watched Trains, which came out in 1966. His fellow Czech film director Ivan Passer called Closely Watched Trains a nearly perfect movie.\n\nMenzel won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Closely Watched Trains. The YouTube clip of this victory is surreal. Danny Kaye reads the winning film. The ceremony announcer wrongly says that Serbian director Aleksandar Petrović is coming to accept the award. Menzel says simply, “I am very happy that Americans like Czech film.” Danny Kaye helps guide him offstage.\n\nClosely Watched Trains is, like several of Menzel’s movies, based on a Hrabal story, and the script is a collaboration between the two men. Hrabal has said that working on the movie with Menzel was “like two mirrors flashing at each other with the reflections of our poetic vision.”\n\nThis black-and-white movie is about a train station and its workers in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. More than that, it is about a young man named Miloš (Václav Neckář) who is obsessed with losing his virginity. The whole thing takes place in and around, or at least not far from, the station, giving the viewer the impression that she, too, lives in this little world.\n\nWatching the film, I find it hard to believe Menzel wasn’t even 30 when he made it, and not only because of how well-made it is, how the camera lingers a little too long at just the right times. The movie also has an incredible sympathy for Miloš, the kind that one sometimes finds people are only capable of showing to the young when they themselves are older. This becomes doubly surprising to me after reading, in Josef Skvorecky’s 1971 memoir All the Bright Young Men and Women: A Personal History of the Czech Cinema, that Menzel in real life was like the young protagonist.\n\nThe movie is—it must be said—very horny. Everyone in this movie is constantly thinking about, and trying to have, sex. But it’s also very funny and sweet and, in the end, sad. It is also, I think, about how the small things seem big, and how they’re inextricably interwoven with the big things too.\n\n“Life is like that,” I excitedly tell my husband after watching it. Look at me, for example, upset about work, even with everything going on in the country and the world. He nods, pretending to agree that, yes, our lives have something in common with Jiří Menzel’s Closely Watched Trains.\n\nBut the thing is, as I proceed through the years of Menzel’s movies, there is a moment like that for me while watching every one of them. His tragicomic send-ups are set, for the most part, in rural Czechoslovakia. They are very much rooted in their time and place. One might think that the historical and geographic specificity would make the movies feel more removed from me, from my life, but the opposite happens. There, in the fictionalized Czech countryside of the 1960s, I recognize people I know, or situations I’ve seen, or feelings I’ve had. Maybe this is because cultural specificity can allow for recognition of universality and shared humanity. Or maybe it’s just because I like Menzel’s sense of humor. In any case, the differences between the films’ settings and mine only serve to make me feel the commonalities more acutely.\n\nThere is 1968’s richly colored Capricious Summer, based on a novel by Vladislav Vančura, in which a circus performer (played by a tightrope-walking Menzel) and his lovely assistant (Jana Preissová) come to a village, throwing the romantic lives of three friends into competitive chaos. Watching it feels not unlike sitting out by a lake on a hot day, observing the people around you, each of you convinced that you’re the singular protagonist of the story.\n\nThe movie starts with one of the characters (Rudolf Hrušínský) bemoaning what an unpleasant summer it is. It ends the same way. So much has happened, but on the surface, nothing has changed. “That is what these summers are like,” I think. There is the absurd injustice and incompetence of the powerful in Crime in the Nightclub (a.k.a. Crime in a Music Hall), from that same year. The authority figures in this movie could have strolled out into the streets of Prague—or, for that matter, Downtown Washington, DC, a bus ride away from my own neighborhood of Petworth—all these years later and fit in quite nicely.\n\nThe Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in August 1968. That autumn, Menzel refused to serve on a film festival jury in Locarno, Switzerland, “because Soviet, East German and Hungarian entries were to be considered for the grand prize” mere months after Warsaw Pact troops had invaded his country. The Prague Spring was frozen over and Menzel’s career was “derailed” (his word) until 1974.\n\n“I was the first Czech film-maker prevented from working and was only able to return to film-making in 1974,” his Guardian obituary quotes him as having said. “It was only after some years and several more films that I felt I had returned to a position of prestige.”\n\n“Could you imagine?” I ask my husband while out walking the dog. I am frustrated as a freelance journalist waiting for emails; Menzel was banned from making his chosen type of art and still stayed busy creating, not knowing whether things would ever turn around again. I feel a pang of empathy and shame in my own self-pity just thinking about it.\n\nMy husband looks at the sidewalk. “Someone lost their hat!” he exclaims. Indeed, there in front of us, a straw visor was lying on the ground.\n\nThe Czech or Czechoslovak New Wave, the 1960s movement notable for its humor, surrealism, and subversiveness, ended with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. “Censorship is like weather,” Menzel once said. “Sometimes it’s cold, sometimes it’s warm. You just have to know how to dress.”\n\nMenzel was able to work again because he made a compromise. He recanted his political beliefs and made Who Looks for Gold? (1974), a socialist-realist movie about workers building a dam. There were some who wrote him off for this. They would never make such a statement or such a film. Menzel saw it differently. “You can’t stop making movies just because the communists want it,” he once said. So you must figure out how to continue to make them.\n\nEven this—the dilemma of whether it was more important to make art, knowing you knew your own truth, or to stand openly in that truth—brings me back to our moment.\n\nIn the United States today, journalists are debating what constitutes acceptable professional speech in the face of a rising Far Right. Screenwriters and actors are on strike, forgoing payment in order to demand fair treatment from Hollywood’s CEOs. And what repercussions will face those students and artists who protested the Hungarian government’s takeover of the University of Theatre and Film Arts in Budapest? What choices will they be asked to make down the line? Just this summer, the Financial Times published a report on theater directors in Russia deciding whether to protest against Putin’s war or to continue working.\n\nThese situations are not the same, of course. But they are all circumstances in which one is asked to choose between public principle or the chance to more easily, or at least more immediately, make art. This is not a question to which one truly knows the answer until it is asked.\n\nThe movies that followed, in the 1970s and ’80s, are less obviously political than Closely Watched Trains or Crime in the Nightclub or Larks on a String. Still, there are similarities across the decades. There are the actors, of course, like Hrušínský and František Řehák. Watching them appear in one movie after another feels not unlike watching Wes Anderson movies today: There’s that actor again! He’s more rakish (or more slovenly) than ever!\n\nBut there are also thematic echoes: the obsession with sex, the wry humor, the way characters ultimately choose gentleness toward one another, the need to get around authority. And in these movies, too, I see elements of real, recognizable life there on the screen. Cutting It Short (1980) is one of the best portrayals I’ve ever seen of a loving, tender marriage between two people (Jiří Schmitzer and Magda Vášáryová) who move through the world in different ways. The movie is set, mostly, at a brewery, and Menzel does a wonderful job capturing all the motion and commotion of a busy place, with people always moving in and out. It starts in the Austro-Hungarian empire and ends in an independent country, and the characters all think they know the significance of this transformation, but of course we the audience know that they do not. That’s always how it is, I think. Look at Russia and its war in Ukraine and how it has—and hasn’t—changed Europe. Look at the United States now, after the first Trump administration. We say nothing will ever be the same, and we think we know what that means. But we do not, because we cannot.\n\nThen there is My Sweet Little Village, the 1985 film that was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It’s about a simple young man named Otík (János Bán) and the man with whom he works, Mr. Pávek (Marián Labuda). The film, a soft, loving portrait of these two men and the people around them, lets the audience in on the secret of how much Mr. Pávek cares for Otík just a beat before Mr. Pávek himself realizes it. The timing throughout the movie is perfect: everything unfolds at exactly the moment that is funniest, or most frustrating, or most cathartic. At the very end, startling myself, I cry.\n\n“People have such depressing lives that in films they should be stroked a little bit,” Menzel told The New York Times in 1987. “One should help them a little bit to hold their heads up high.”\n\nLarks on a String was finally released in 1990. “I didn’t think the whole business would last so long: a few months maybe, not 22 years,” Menzel once told interviewer Judith Vidal-Hall.\n\nOn rewatch, I decide it is one of the best movies I’ve ever seen, so much funnier and sadder than I had remembered. It is the story of characters made to work in a junkyard for socialist rehabilitation. These people include a saxophonist (Eugen Jegorov), who is there because saxophones are banned as bourgeois, and a lawyer (Leoš Suchařípa), who is there because he insisted a defendant had the right to defend himself. The use of light in the movie is fascinating too. Characters stare out of tiny windows. At one point, one man (Neckář again) uses a mirror to flash a light on his love interest’s face. At the very end, that same character descends into a mine. I watch as he goes down via mineshaft, staring up at the shrinking but still visible sky.\n\n“This era will smelt you down too,” a man from the trade union (Hrušínský yet again) says to them, and you realize, watching the movie, that it could, but it won’t. Their shared sense of humor and dignity will not be crushed by the times. (Though they, too, it should be said, are also obsessed with women.)\n\nI finish the 10 movies available on Eastern European Movies, which takes me two weeks. I don’t only watch when I am feeling angsty or unproductive. I watch one every weekday. I get work out of the way so I can watch my Menzel movie of the day, or I watch a movie to start my day and then see resonances and reflections of it in the hours that follow.\n\nBut having gone through those films, I am in for more of a challenge.\n\nThe easiest of Menzel’s films to find is I Served the King of England, from 2006. It was his first film in 12 years: The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin (1994) was, according to film critic Peter Hames, “unjustly ignored at home and abroad.” Making movies after the dissolution of the Eastern Bloc proved difficult: if nothing else, the state had funded his movies before. Hames said that Menzel told him at a London screening, “I don’t think I’ll make another film.” I can picture them together. I can hear the resignation.\n\n“There are no limits and therefore no boundaries within which to create. That boundary between us and the West makes us hunger for what is on the other side,” the director told Vidal-Hall in 1995, adding, “I need a reason for what I do. Before it was easy. It’s not enough just to want to be rich and famous.” Menzel added that he thought the constraints of communism had made the New Wave possible. Now that people could say whatever they wanted, they found nothing worth saying.\n\nBut over a decade later, he made I Served the King of England, yet again based on a Hrabal story, a dark comedy about a young man (Ivan Barnev) who wants only to be a millionaire and open a hotel. He achieves this goal—but ends up married to a Nazi (Julia Jentsch) and working for fascist Germany in the process, before heading to prison, emerging as an older, subdued man (Oldřich Kaiser). It is perhaps Menzel’s most visually sumptuous movie. I watch as money is carefully arranged on the floor, and then again as it’s used to cover a woman’s naked body. And I think the story of a person who sees a horrific regime as an opportunity to move up and get rich is, unfortunately, a timely one. Mostly, though, I am taken with the final message: a person becomes human not in the moments they choose but in the moments they would rather not have happened.\n\nI purchase Ten Minutes Older: The Cello on DVD. It was one of two collections of short films made to mark the new millennium, Menzel’s short a wordless tribute to Hrušínský. It begins with a shot of Hrušínský in middle age, and then shows us his life in film—and because he worked with Menzel over and over again, the films I’d spent the past weeks watching all make appearances. “This is from The Snowdrop Festival!” I excitedly tell my husband, whom I’d convinced to watch with me. “And that’s Cutting It Short!”\n\nI watch Hrušínský grow young and then, finally, very old. At one point, white text appears on a black screen that reads simply, “Ten minutes. Our life is not much longer.” I think of how wonderful it was to be young, and how amazing it is to grow up.\n\nI put out a call for help on Twitter to find the remaining films. Miraculously, a friend from college who works as a film researcher sees my tweet and tells me he can probably help. And he does.\n\nUnfortunately, aside from some key words like “yes,” “wait,” and “cucumber,” I do not speak Czech, and only two of the movies left on my list are available with English subtitles. That will have to suffice for now. I turn to the task of watching the two that my friend sent me. First, there is Those Wonderful Movie Cranks, from 1978, a charming love letter to filmmaking that I thought had such a 21st-century look that I triple-check the year it came out while watching it. I realize this is because Menzel made short old-timey silent films and put them in at various points. This has the effect of making the main movie, though it came out in the late 1970s and is about the establishment of the first Czech movie theater, seem as fresh as the modern world.\n\nThen, finally, there is Menzel’s last feature film, The Don Juans (2013).\n\nThe Don Juans was the zaniest Menzel movie I watched. It is a very full movie: full of characters, full of plot twists, and, perhaps above all, full of music. A small town puts on the Mozart opera Don Giovanni. The director (Jan Hartl) pretends he does not like opera. He does, however, make no secret about how much he likes women, particularly sopranos. The other subplot features an older woman (Libuše Šafránková) who is herself a single mother, the matriarch of a line of women who have all been loved and left by Don Juans. The movie didn’t have the poignancy of my favorite Menzel movies, but it did have the sex, and the dedication to art, and a sense of humor about itself.\n\n“Humor is the most important thing,” Menzel said while promoting The Don Juans. I think, maybe, that I know what he meant.\n\nAt the end of the movie, the opera company breaks up, all the soloists going on to sing in different jobs. One works as a singing waiter. One sings in the army. One joins a band. The older woman, meanwhile, directs a children’s choir. “Drink your cup of wine dry,” the children sing, “and take joy from every moment.”\n\nIt isn’t that Menzel’s movies are all joyous all the time. It’s that there is a sense of humor in all of them. Life is hard and full of suffering, and violence, physical and otherwise, abounds. But something about these films, even the ones with frustrating, unhappy endings, is always winking at us, the way in life a person might suddenly grasp the humor in a situation and laughingly ask, “You seein’ this?” And I am.\n\nAfter finishing all of the movies that I could find, there is still one work I need to watch. CzechMate: In Search of Jiří Menzel (2018) is a seven-and-a-half-hour documentary from Indian director Shivendra Singh Dungarpur. It is an in-depth exploration of Menzel’s work and of Czech and Slovak New Wave cinema. I borrow my friend’s Criterion Collection login and settle in to watch it over the course of a few days.\n\n“Film is my job,” Menzel says in the first five minutes of the movie. “Sometimes it is fun, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn’t. But I don’t have any special sacred relationship to it. It is my job. That’s all.”\n\nI watch him say this with annoyance and awe. That’s all? I had spent weeks of my life grappling with my own relationship to work and productivity through these movies. In the process, I purchased two books on the Czech New Wave, two DVDs, and a lifetime subscription to Eastern European Movies. And at the very end of all this, I discover that the person to whose work I was turning didn’t even identify himself as having a relationship to the thing he was making.\n\nBut even as I huff, I know that isn’t true. For one thing, I’d opened this whole new world to myself. And now I can seek out other movies too, such as ones Menzel acted in, or films by other Czech New Wave directors. Not only had I seen so much more, but when I let myself feel generous, I admit I know more too.\n\nBeyond that, though, there is this: I think that maybe Menzel meant that, yes, there were the movies, and making them and stopping and starting again. He had, after all, made a difficult decision in the 1970s to continue to make movies. That was work.\n\nBut there was also his friendship with Hrabal. There was his creativity, which existed in the films but outside of them too, which no authority or regime could take from him. There was bearing witness to all that he lived through. And there are the things in the movies themselves—like sex, love, a nice meal with beer, perseverance in the face of disappointment, laughter.\n\nThere is life, in other words. Full of joy and sadness and frustration and humor. And full of meaning and purpose too, even—or perhaps especially—when it seems like nothing is happening.\n\nEmily Tamkin is a global affairs journalist based in Washington, DC.

According to the organisers of a 2009 Hrabal exhibition in Brno, his biological father was probably Bohumil Blecha (1893–1970), a teacher's son a year older than Marie, who was her friend from the neighbourhood. Marie's parents opposed the idea of their daughter marrying Blecha, as he was about to serve in the Austro-Hungarian Army.[2] World War I started four months after Hrabal's birth, and Blecha was sent to the Italian front, before being invalided out of service.[3] Blecha's daughter, Drahomíra Blechová-Kalvodová, says her father told her when she was 18 that Hrabal was her half-brother. Bohumil and his biological father never met formally, according to Blechová-Kalvodová.[3] Hrabal and Blechová-Kalvodová met twice; a dedication on a picture from 1994 says: \"To sister Drahomíra, Hrabal!\"[3]\n\nHrabal was baptised Bohumil František Kilián. Until the age of three, he lived mainly with his grandparents, Kateřina Kiliánová (born Bartlová) (d. 1950)[2][4] and Tomáš Kilián (died 1925), a descendant of a French soldier injured at the Battle of Austerlitz,[5][6] in Brno, while his mother worked in Polná as an assistant book-keeper in the town's brewery. She worked there with her future husband, František Hrabal (1889– 1966); one František Hrabal was listed as Bohumil's godfather when he was baptised on 4 April 1914, but František was also the first name of Bohumil's future step-grandfather, a soft-drinks trader. František Hrabal, Hrabal's stepfather, was a friend of Blecha.[7] He is a prominent character in some of Hrabal's most famous fiction work,[8] and in Gaps, the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy, Hrabal wrote that he declined an invitation to meet his biological father and considered František Hrabal to be his father.[9]\n\nMarie and František married in February 1917, shortly before Bohumil's second birthday. Hrabal's half-brother, Břetislav Josef Hrabal (1916–1985), was born later that year; Břetislav, known as Slávek, is said to have been an excellent raconteur.[2][4] The family moved in August 1919 to Nymburk, a town on the banks of the Elbe River, where František Hrabal became the manager of a brewery.[10] Both Marie and František were involved in amateur dramatics,[11] though Marie was more active.[12] Hrabal later recalled having a complex about this, and feeling embarrassed by her being the centre of attention.[13]\n\nHrabal's uncle was Bohuslav Kilián (1892–1942), a lawyer, journalist and publisher of the cultural magazines Salon and Měsíc. The latter had a German version, Der Monat, that was distributed throughout Europe, but not in Nazi Germany.[14][15]\n\nIn 1920, Hrabal started primary school in Nymburk. In September 1925, he spent one year at a grammar school in Brno (now Gymnázium třída Kapitána Jaroše, later attended by Milan Kundera). He failed the first year, and later attended a technical secondary school in Nymburk. There too he struggled to concentrate on his studies, despite extra tutoring from his uncle.[2][4]\n\nIn June 1934, Hrabal left school with a certificate that said he could be considered for a place at university on a technical course. He took private classes in Latin for a year, passing the state exam in the town of Český Brod with an \"adequate\" grade on 3 October 1935. On 7 October, he registered at Charles University in Prague to study for a law degree. He graduated only in March 1946,[16] as Czech universities were shut down in 1939 and remained so until the end of Nazi occupation.[17] During the war, he worked as a railway labourer and dispatcher in Kostomlaty, near Nymburk, an experience reflected in one of his best-known works, Closely Observed Trains (Czech: Ostře sledované vlaky). He worked variously as an insurance agent (1946–47), a travelling salesman (1947–49) and a manual labourer alongside the graphic artist Vladimír Boudník in the Kladno steelworks (1949–52, and again briefly, 1953), an experience that inspired the \"total realism\" of texts such as Jarmilka that he was writing at the time.[18] After a serious injury, he worked in a recycling mill in the Prague district of Libeň as a paper packer (1954–59), before working as a stagehand (1959–62) at the S. K. Neumann Theatre in Prague (today Divadlo pod Palmovkou).[7]\n\nHrabal lived in the city from the late 1940s onward, for much of it (1950–73) at 24 Na Hrázi ul. in Prague - Libeň; the house was demolished in 1988.[7] In 1956, Hrabal married Eliška Plevová (known as \"Pipsi\" to Hrabal, and referred to by that name in some of his works), the 30-year-old daughter of Karel Pleva, procurator and manager of a wood factory in the South Moravian town of Břeclav. In 1965, the couple bought a country cottage in Kersko, near Nymburk; the cottage became home to his numerous cats. Eliška died in 1987.[7]\n\nHrabal began as a poet, producing a collection of lyrical poetry in 1948, entitled Ztracená ulička. It was withdrawn from circulation when the communist regime was established. In the early 1950s, Hrabal was a member of an underground literary group run by Jiří Kolář, an artist, poet, critic and central figure in Czechoslovak culture.[19] Another member of the group was the novelist Josef Škvorecký. Hrabal produced stories for the group, but did not seek publication.\n\nTwo stories by Hrabal (Hovory lidí) appeared in 1956 as a supplement in the annual Report of the Association of Czech Bibliophiles (Czech: Zprávy spolku českých bibliofilů), which had a print-run of 250. Hrabal's first book was withdrawn a week before publication, in 1959. It was eventually published in 1963, as Pearls of the Deep (Czech: Perlička na dně). In the same year, he became a professional writer. Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age (Czech: Taneční hodiny pro starší a pokročilé) followed in 1964 and Closely Observed Trains (Czech: Ostře sledované vlaky) in 1965.\n\nAfter the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Hrabal was banned from publishing.[20] In 1970, two of his books – Domácí úkoly and Poupata – were banned, after they had been printed and bound but before they were distributed. In the following years, he published several of his best known works in samizdat editions (including The Little Town Where Time Stood Still (Czech: Městečko, kde se zastavil čas) and I Served the King of England (Czech: Obsluhoval jsem anglického krále).\n\nIn 1975, Hrabal gave an interview to the publication Tvorba in which he made self-critical comments, which enabled some of his work to appear in print, albeit typically in heavily edited form.[21][22] Hrabal's interlocutors were anonymous in the journal, but it was later discovered that the published interview was at least a third version of the text,[22] and that the more explicitly ideological statements were inserted by editors Karel Sýs and Jaromír Pelc according to contemporary party doctrine.[22] One such passage reads \"...as a Czech writer I am connected to the Czech people, with its Socialist past and future\".[21]\n\nSome young dissidents were incensed by Hrabal's actions; poet Ivan \"Magor\" Jirous organised an event on Kampa Island at which his books were burned,[22][23][21] and the singer Karel Kryl called him a \"whore\".[24] However, his defenders point out that an edited version of a key text, Handbook for the Apprentice Palaverer (Czech: Rukovět̕ pábitelského učně), was published alongside the interview, which ended the ban on publication and permitted his work once again to reach the broader Czechoslovak public.[21][22][25] Ludvík Vaculík, who had published his work in samizdat and would later continue to do so,[26] defended him, saying that the interview demonstrated that Hrabal was a writer of such standing that he could not be suppressed and the regime had had to acknowledge him.[22][25] Additionally, some of his writings continued to be printed only in samizdat and as underground editions abroad,[21] including Too Loud a Solitude (Czech: Přílíš hlučná samota) which circulated in a number of samizdat editions until it was finally published officially in 1989. Hrabal avoided political engagement, and he was not a signatory of the Charter 77 civic initiative against the communist regime in 1977.\n\nHrabal's two best-known novels are Closely Observed Trains (Czech: Ostře sledované vlaky) (1965) and I Served the King of England (1971), both of which were made into movies by the Czech director Jiří Menzel (in 1966 and 2006, respectively). Hrabal worked closely with Menzel on the script for Closely Watched Trains which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. The two men became close friends and subsequently collaborated on other film projects, including the long-banned 1969 film Larks on a String.\n\nHrabal was a noted raconteur,[22][27][25] and much of his story-telling took place in a number of pubs including, most famously, U zlatého tygra (At the Golden Tiger) on Husova Street in Prague.[27] He met the Czech President Václav Havel, the American President Bill Clinton and the US ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright at U zlatého tygra on 11 January 1994.[21][28][22]\n\nHrabal died in February 1997 after falling from a window on the fifth floor of Bulovka Hospital in Prague. Initially, there were reports that he fell while attempting to feed pigeons,[29][27] though these were rejected by friends including his translator, Susanna Roth,[30] who angrily dismissed the reports as a way of censoring Hrabal even in death.[22] The story was later publicly renounced by professor Pavel Dungl, Bulovka's chief physician.[31][32] First Roth[32] and later Tomáš Mazal noted that suicide recurs as a theme throughout his work,[22] and both Dungl and Mazal said that early in the morning on the day of his death, Hrabal mentioned to Dungl an \"invitation\" he received in his dream from a dead poet and painter, Karel Hlaváček, who was buried in a cemetery next to the hospital. Some years later, Professor Dungl said he had no doubts about Hrabal's death being a suicide.[33][31] He was buried in the cemetery of Hradištko near Kersko. According to his wishes, he was buried in an oak coffin marked with the inscription \"Pivovar Polná\" (Polná Brewery), the brewery where his mother and stepfather had met.\n\nHrabal wrote in an expressive, highly visual style. He affected the use of long sentences; his works Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age (1964) and Vita Nuova (1987) consist entirely of one single sentence. Political quandaries and the accompanying moral ambiguities are recurrent themes in his works. Many of Hrabal's characters are portrayed as \"wise fools\" — simpletons with occasional inadvertently profound thoughts — who are also given to coarse humour, lewdness, and a determination to survive and enjoy life despite harsh circumstances they found themselves in.[citation needed]\n\nMuch of the impact of Hrabal's writing derives from his juxtaposition of the beauty and cruelty found in everyday life. Vivid depictions of pain human beings casually inflict on animals (as in the scene where families of mice are caught in a paper compactor) symbolise the pervasiveness of cruelty among human beings. His characterisations also can be comic, giving his prose a baroque or mediaeval tinge.[citation needed] He is known for his \"comic, slightly surreal tales about poor workers, eccentrics, failures, and nonconformists\"; his early stories are about \"social misfits and happily disreputable people\".[34]\n\nAlongside fellow satirists Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek and Milan Kundera, Hrabal is often described as one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century.[citation needed] Author Ewa Mazierska compared his works to Ladislav Grosman's, in that his literary works typically contained a mixture of comedy and tragedy.[35] His works have been translated into 27 languages.[citation needed]\n• It's interesting how young poets think of death while old fogies think of girls. — Bohumil Hrabal in Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age\n• Bohumil Hrabal embodies as no other the fascinating Prague.

Many of Hrabal's characters are portrayed as \"wise fools\" - simpletons with occasional or inadvertent profound thoughts - who are also given to coarse humour, lewdness, and a determination to survive and enjoy oneself despite harsh circumstances. Political quandaries and their concomitant moral ambiguities are also a recurrent theme.\n\n\n\nAlong with Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek, and Milan Kundera - who were also imaginative and amusing satirists - he is considered one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century. His works have been translated into 27 languages.Bohumil Hrabal | Novelist, Short Story Writer, Poet | Britannica: Bohumil Hrabal (born March 28, 1914, Brno, Czech.—died Feb. 3, 1997, Prague) was a Czech author of comic, nearly surreal tales about poor workers, eccentrics, failures, and nonconformists.\n\nIn his youth Hrabal was influenced by a highly talkative uncle who arrived for a two-week visit and stayed 40 years. Though Hrabal received a law degree from Charles University, he never practiced; instead, he worked as a salesman, in a theatre, and at factory and office jobs. His early short stories collected in Perlička na dně (1963; A Pearl at the Bottom), Pábitelé (1964; Palaverers), and Automat svět (1966; The Death of Mr. Baltisberger) are plotless, darkly humorous, free-association anecdotes, typically about social misfits and happily disreputable folk. In Tanečni hodiny pro starší a pokrocǐilé (1964; Dancing Lessons for Seniors and the Advanced), an elderly man tells his life story in one 90-page, unfinished sentence. His best-known work is his most conventional in form: the novel Ostře sledované vlaky (1964; Closely Watched Trains), in which a youth’s comic problems end with heroic martyrdom. Hrabal subsequently adapted the work as a screenplay, which won the 1967 Academy Award for best foreign film.\n\nHrabal’s unconventional writings were banned after the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia in 1969, and his autobiographical works describe his fear of the secret police. After his country achieved independence in 1989, Hrabal’s underground works from the 1970s were at last published there, including Obsluhoval jsem anglického krále (I Served the King of England) and Příliš hlučná samota (Too Loud a Solitude).1980 - Wikipedia: This article is about the year 1980. For other uses, see 1980 (disambiguation)1980 United States presidential election - Wikipedia: Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 4, 1980. Republican nominee, former California governor Ronald Reagan, defeated incumbent Democratic President Jimmy Carter in a landslide victory. This was the second consecutive election in which an incumbent president was defeated, although Gerald Ford assumed the presidency after President Richard Nixon resigned and was not elected, as well as the first election since 1888 that saw the defeat of an incumbent Democratic president.\n\nCarter's unpopularity, his poor relations with Democratic leaders, and the poor economic conditions under his administration encouraged an unsuccessful intra-party challenge from Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. Meanwhile, the Republican primaries were contested between Reagan, former Central Intelligence Agency director George H. W. Bush, Illinois Representative John B. Anderson, and several other candidates. All of Reagan's opponents had dropped out by the end of the primaries, and the Republicans nominated a ticket consisting of Reagan and Bush. Anderson entered the general election as an independent candidate with Patrick Lucey, former Wisconsin governor, as his running mate.\n\nReagan campaigned for increased defense spending, supply-side economic policies, and a balanced budget. His campaign was aided by Democratic dissatisfaction with Carter, the Iran hostage crisis, and a worsening economy marred by stagflation. Carter attacked Reagan as a dangerous right-wing extremist, and warned that Reagan would cut Medicare and Social Security. The Carter campaign was aided early on by the rally 'round the flag effect from the hostage crisis; as the crisis lasted to election day, it became a detriment.[2]\n\nReagan won the election in a landslide with 489 Electoral College votes to Carter's 49, and 50.7% of the popular vote to Carter's 41.0%. Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote and no electoral votes. Due to the rise of conservatism following Reagan's victory, historians have considered the election a political realignment that began with Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964. This election began an ongoing pattern in which Rust Belt states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin voted for the same presidential candidate, with the sole exception of 1988.[3]\n\nThroughout the 1970s, the United States underwent a wrenching period of stagflation (low economic growth, high inflation, and interest rates), and intermittent energy crises.[4] By October 1978, Iran—a major oil supplier to the United States at the time—was experiencing a major uprising that severely damaged its oil infrastructure and greatly weakened its capability to produce oil.[5] In January 1979, shortly after Iran's leader Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fled the country, Iranian opposition figure Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ended his 14-year exile in France and returned to Iran to establish an Islamic Republic, largely hostile to American interests and influence in the country.[5] In the spring and summer of 1979, inflation was on the rise and various parts of the United States were experiencing energy shortages.[6]\n\nCarter was widely blamed for the return of the long gas lines in the summer of 1979 that were last seen just after the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He planned on delivering his fifth major speech on energy, but he felt that the American people were no longer listening. Carter left for the presidential retreat of Camp David. \"For more than a week, a veil of secrecy enveloped the proceedings. Dozens of prominent Democratic Party leaders—members of Congress, governors, labor leaders, academics and clergy—were summoned to the mountaintop retreat to confer with the beleaguered president.\" His pollster, Pat Caddell, told him that the American people simply faced a crisis of confidence because of the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.; the Vietnam War; and Watergate.[7] On July 15, 1979, Carter gave a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people. This came to be known as his \"Malaise speech\", although Carter never used the word in the speech.[8]\n\nMany expected Senator Ted Kennedy to successfully challenge Carter in the upcoming Democratic primary. Kennedy's official announcement was scheduled for early November. A television interview with Roger Mudd of CBS a few days before the announcement went badly, however. Kennedy gave an \"incoherent and repetitive\"[9] answer to the question of why he was running, and the polls, which showed him leading Carter by 58–25 in August now had him ahead 49–39.[10] Kennedy was also politically scarred by the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident;[11][12] the controversy had been a major reason for Kennedy's decision to not run for president in 1972 and 1976.[12]\n\nMeanwhile, Carter was given an opportunity for political redemption when the Khomeini regime again gained public attention and allowed the taking of 52 American hostages by a group of Islamist students and militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. Carter's calm approach towards the handling of this crisis resulted in his approval ratings jump in the 60-percent range in some polls, due to a \"rally round the flag\" effect.[13]\n\nBy the beginning of the election campaign, the prolonged Iran hostage crisis had sharpened public perceptions of a national crisis.[14] On April 25, 1980, Carter's ability to use the hostage crisis to regain public acceptance eroded when his high risk attempt to rescue the hostages ended in disaster when eight servicemen were killed. The unsuccessful rescue attempt drew further skepticism towards his leadership skills.[15]\n\nFollowing the failed rescue attempt, Carter took overwhelming blame for the Iran hostage crisis, in which the followers of the Ayatollah Khomeini burned American flags and chanted anti-American slogans, paraded the captured American hostages in public, and burned Carter in effigy. Carter's critics saw him as an inept leader who had failed to solve the worsening economic problems at home. His supporters defended the president as a decent, well-intentioned man being unfairly criticized for problems that had been escalating for years.[16]\n\nWhen the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in late 1979, Carter seized international leadership in rallying opposition. He cut off American grain sales, which hurt Soviet consumers and annoyed American farmers. In terms of prestige, the Soviets were deeply hurt by the large-scale boycott of their 1980 Summer Olympics. Furthermore, Carter began secret support of the rebel forces in Afghanistan that successfully tied down the Soviet army for a decade. The effect was to end détente and reopen the Cold War.[17][18]\n\nThe following candidates were frequently interviewed by major broadcast networks and cable news channels, were listed in publicly published national polls, or had held a public office. Reagan received 7,709,793 votes in the primaries.\n\nFormer governor Ronald Reagan of California was the odds-on favorite to win his party's nomination for president after nearly beating incumbent President Gerald Ford just four years earlier. Reagan dominated the primaries early, driving from the field Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker from Tennessee, former governor John Connally of Texas, Senator Robert Dole from Kansas, Representative Phil Crane from Illinois, and Representative John Anderson from Illinois, who dropped out of the race to run as an Independent. George H. W. Bush from Texas posed the strongest challenge to Reagan with his victories in the Pennsylvania and Michigan primaries, but it was not enough to turn the tide. Reagan won the nomination on the first round at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan, in July, then chose Bush (his top rival) as his running mate. Reagan, Bush, and Dole would all go on to be the nominees in the next four elections. (Reagan in 1984, Bush in 1988 and 1992, and Dole in 1996).\n\nThe following candidates were frequently interviewed by major broadcast networks, were listed in published national polls, or had held public office. Carter received 10,043,016 votes in the primaries.\n\nThe three major Democratic candidates in early 1980 were incumbent President Jimmy Carter, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Governor Jerry Brown of California. Brown withdrew on April 2. Carter and Kennedy faced off in 34 primaries. Not counting the 1968 election in which Lyndon Johnson withdrew his candidacy, this was the most tumultuous primary race that an elected incumbent president had encountered since President Taft, during the highly contentious election of 1912.\n\nDuring the summer of 1980, there was a short-lived \"Draft Muskie\" movement; Secretary of State Edmund Muskie was seen as a favorable alternative to a deadlocked convention. One poll showed that Muskie would be a more popular alternative to Carter than Kennedy, implying that the attraction was not so much to Kennedy as to the fact that he was not Carter. Muskie was polling even with Ronald Reagan at the time, while Carter was seven points behind.[19] Although the underground \"Draft Muskie\" campaign failed, it became a political legend.[20]\n\nAfter defeating Kennedy in 24 of 34 primaries, Carter entered the party's convention in New York in August with 60 percent of the delegates pledged to him on the first ballot. Still, Kennedy refused to drop out. At the convention, after a futile last-ditch attempt by Kennedy to alter the rules to free delegates from their first-ballot pledges, Carter was renominated with 2,129 votes to 1,146 for Kennedy. Vice President Walter Mondale was also renominated. In his acceptance speech, Carter warned that Reagan's conservatism posed a threat to world peace and progressive social welfare programs from the New Deal to the Great Society.[21]\n\nJohn B. Anderson was defeated in the Republican primaries, but entered the general election as an independent candidate. He campaigned as a liberal Republican alternative to Reagan's conservatism. Anderson's campaign appealed primarily to frustrated anti-Carter voters from Republican and Democratic backgrounds.[22] Anderson's running mate was Patrick Lucey, a Democratic former Governor of Wisconsin and then ambassador to Mexico, appointed by President Carter.\n\nThe Libertarian Party nominated Ed Clark for president and David Koch for vice president. They were on the ballot in all 50 states as well as Washington, D.C. The Libertarian Party platform was the only political party in 1980 to contain a plank advocating for the equal rights of homosexual men and women as well as the only party platform to advocate explicitly for \"amnesty\" for all illegal non-citizens.[23]\n\nThe Citizens Party ran biologist Barry Commoner for president and Comanche Native American activist LaDonna Harris for vice president. The Commoner–Harris ticket was on the ballot in twenty-nine states[which?] and in the District of Columbia.[24]\n\nThe following graph depicts the standing of each candidate in the poll aggregators from July 1979 to November 1980.\n\nReagan gained in former Democratic strongholds such as the South and white ethnics dubbed \"Reagan Democrats\",[77] and exuded upbeat optimism.[78] David Frum says Carter ran an attack-based campaign based on \"despair and pessimism\" which \"cost him the election.\"[79] Carter emphasized his record as a peacemaker, and said Reagan's election would threaten civil rights and social programs that stretched back to the New Deal. Reagan's platform also emphasized the importance of peace, as well as a prepared self-defense.[78]\n\nImmediately after the conclusion of the primaries,[date missing] a Gallup poll held that Reagan was ahead, with 58% of voters upset by Carter's handling of the presidency.[78] One analysis of the election has suggested that \"Both Carter and Reagan were perceived negatively by a majority of the electorate.\"[80] While the three leading candidates (Reagan, Anderson and Carter) were religious Christians, Carter had the most support of evangelical Christians according to a Gallup poll.[78] However, in the end, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority lobbying group is credited with giving Reagan two-thirds of the white evangelical vote.[81] According to Carter: \"that autumn [1980] a group headed by Jerry Falwell purchased $10 million in commercials on southern radio and TV to brand me as a traitor to the South and no longer a Christian.\"[82]\n\nThe election of 1980 was a key turning point in American politics. It signaled the new electoral power of the suburbs and the Sun Belt. Reagan's success as a conservative would initiate a realigning of the parties, as Rockefeller-style Republicans and conservative Democrats would either leave politics or change party affiliations through the 1980s and 1990s to leave the parties much more ideologically polarized.[16] While during Barry Goldwater's 1964 campaign, many voters saw his warnings about a too-powerful government as hyperbolic and only 30% of the electorate agreed that government was too powerful, by 1980 a majority of Americans believed that government held too much power.[83]\n\nReagan promised a restoration of the nation's military strength, at the same time 60% of Americans polled felt defense spending was too low.[84] Reagan also promised an end to \"trust me government\" and to restore economic health by implementing a supply-side economic policy. Reagan promised a balanced budget within three years (which he said would be \"the beginning of the end of inflation\"), accompanied by a 30% reduction in tax rates over those same years. With respect to the economy, Reagan famously said, \"A recession is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his.\"[78] Reagan also criticized the \"windfall profit tax\" that Carter and Congress enacted that year in regards to domestic oil production and promised to attempt to repeal it as president.[85] The tax was not a tax on profits, but on the difference between the price control-mandated price and the market price.[86]\n\nOn the issue of women's rights there was much division, with many feminists frustrated with Carter, the only major-party candidate who supported the Equal Rights Amendment. After a bitter Convention fight between Republican feminists and antifeminists the Republican Party dropped their forty-year endorsement of the ERA.[87] Reagan, however, announced his dedication to women's rights and his intention to, if elected, appoint women to his cabinet and the first female justice to the Supreme Court.[88] He also pledged to work with all 50 state governors to combat discrimination against women and to equalize federal laws as an alternative to the ERA.[78] Reagan was convinced to give an endorsement of women's rights in his nomination acceptance speech.\n\nCarter was criticized by his own aides for not having a \"grand plan\" for the recovery of the economy, nor did he ever make any campaign promises; he often criticized Reagan's economic recovery plan, but did not create one of his own in response.[78]\n\nIn August, after the Republican National Convention, Ronald Reagan gave a campaign speech at the annual Neshoba County Fair on the outskirts of Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers were murdered in 1964. He was the first presidential candidate ever to campaign at the fair.[89] Reagan famously announced, \"Programs like education and others should be turned back to the states and local communities with the tax sources to fund them. I believe in states' rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can at the community level and the private level.\"[78] Reagan also stated, \"I believe we have distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended to be given in the Constitution to that federal establishment.\" He went on to promise to \"restore to states and local governments the power that properly belongs to them.\"[90] President Carter criticized Reagan for injecting \"hate and racism\" by the \"rebirth of code words like 'states' rights'\".[91]\n\nTwo days later, Reagan appeared at the Urban League convention in New York, where he said, \"I am committed to the protection and enforcement of the civil rights of black Americans. This commitment is interwoven into every phase of the plans I will propose.\"[78] He then said that he would develop \"enterprise zones\" to help with urban renewal.[78]\n\nThe media's main criticism of Reagan centered on his gaffes. When Carter kicked off his general election campaign in Tuscumbia, Reagan—referring to the Southern U.S. as a whole—claimed that Carter had begun his campaign in the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. In doing so, Reagan seemed to insinuate that the KKK represented the South, which caused many Southern governors to denounce Reagan's remarks.[92] Additionally, Reagan was widely ridiculed by Democrats for saying that trees caused pollution; he later said that he meant only certain types of pollution and his remarks had been misquoted.[93]\n\nMeanwhile, Carter was burdened by a continued weak economy and the Iran hostage crisis.[84] Inflation, high interest rates, and unemployment continued through the course of the campaign, and the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran became, according to David Frum in How We Got Here: The '70s, a symbol of American impotence during the Carter years.[84] John Anderson's independent candidacy, aimed at eliciting support from liberals, especially former supporters of Ted Kennedy, was also seen as hurting Carter more than Reagan,[78] especially in reliably Democratic states such as Massachusetts and New York.\n\nThe League of Women Voters, which had sponsored the 1976 Ford/Carter debate series, announced that it would do so again for the next cycle in the spring of 1979. Carter steadfastly refused to participate in a debate if Anderson was included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. A League-sponsored debate was held on September 21, 1980, in the Baltimore Convention Center. Of Carter's refusal to debate, Reagan said: \"He [Carter] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell\".[95] Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch Reagan, managed only a narrow win, according to many in the media at that time, with Reagan putting up a much stronger performance than expected. Despite the narrow win in the debate, Anderson, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and at the time of the debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan enough on their social issue differences and on Reagan's advocation of supply-side economics. Instead, Anderson started off by criticizing Carter: \"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend,\" to which Reagan added: \"It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement.\"[96] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, \"John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?\"[97]\n\nAs September turned into October, the situation remained essentially the same. Reagan insisted Anderson be allowed to participate in a three-way debate, while Carter remained steadfastly opposed to this. As the standoff continued, the second debate was canceled, as was the vice presidential debate.\n\nWith two weeks to go to the election, the Reagan campaign decided at that point that the best thing to do was to accede to all of President Carter's demands. The final debate, featuring only Carter and Reagan, was rescheduled for October 28 in Cleveland, Ohio. The showdown ranked among the highest ratings of any television program in the previous decade. Debate topics included the Iranian hostage crisis and nuclear arms. Carter's campaign sought to portray Reagan as a reckless \"war hawk\", as well as a \"dangerous right-wing radical\". But it was President Carter's reference to his consultation with 12-year-old daughter Amy concerning nuclear weapons policy that became the focus of post-debate analysis and fodder for late-night television jokes. President Carter said he had asked Amy what the most important issue in that election was and she said, \"the control of nuclear arms.\" A famous political cartoon, published the day after Reagan's landslide victory, showed Amy Carter sitting in Jimmy's lap with her shoulders shrugged asking \"the economy? the hostage crisis?\"[citation needed]\n\nWhen President Carter criticized Reagan's record, which included voting against Medicare and Social Security benefits, former Governor Reagan audibly sighed and replied: \"There you go again\".[98]\n\nIn his closing remarks, Reagan asked viewers: \"Are you better off now than you were four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? Do you feel that our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on for the last four years is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have\".[99]\n\nAfter trailing Carter by eight points among registered voters (and by three points among likely voters) right before their debate, Reagan moved into a three-point lead among likely voters immediately afterward.[100]\n\nIn September 1980, former Watergate scandal prosecutor Leon Jaworski accepted a position as honorary chairman of Democrats for Reagan.[84] Five months earlier, Jaworski had harshly criticized Reagan as an \"extremist\"; he said after accepting the chairmanship, \"I would rather have a competent extremist than an incompetent moderate.\"[84]\n\nFormer Democratic Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota (who in 1968 had challenged Lyndon B. Johnson from the left, causing the then-President to all but abdicate) endorsed Reagan.[101]\n\nThree days before the election, the National Rifle Association of America endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time in its history, backing Reagan.[102] Reagan had received the California Rifle and Pistol Association's Outstanding Public Service Award. Carter had appointed Abner J. Mikva, a fervent proponent of gun control, to a federal judgeship and had supported the Alaska Lands Bill, closing 40,000,000 acres (160,000 km2) to hunting.[103]\n\nThe election was held on November 4, 1980.[140] Ronald Reagan and running mate George H. W. Bush defeated the Carter-Mondale ticket by almost 10 percentage points in the popular vote. The electoral college vote was a landslide, with 489 votes (representing 44 states) for Reagan and 49 for Carter (representing six states and Washington, D.C.). Republicans also gained control of the Senate for the first time since 1954.[141]\n\nNBC News projected Reagan as the winner at 8:15 pm EST (5:15 PST), before voting was finished in the West, based on exit polls; it was the first time a broadcast network used exit polling to project a winner, and it took the other broadcast networks by surprise. Carter conceded defeat at 9:50 pm EST.[142][143] Some of Carter's advisors urged him to wait until 11:00 pm EST to allow poll results from the West Coast to come in, but Carter decided to concede earlier in order to avoid the impression that he was sulking. Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill angrily accused Carter of weakening the party's performance in the Senate elections by doing this.[144]\n\nJohn Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote but no states.[145] He had the most support in New England, fueled by liberal and moderate Republicans who felt Reagan was too far to the right, and with voters who normally leaned Democratic but were dissatisfied with the Carter administration's policies. His best showing was in Massachusetts, where he won 15% of the vote.\n\nAnderson performed worst in the South, receiving under 2% of the vote in South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. He said he was accused of spoiling the election by receiving votes that might have otherwise been cast for Carter,[145] but 37% of Anderson voters polled preferred Reagan as their second choice.[146] Libertarian Party nominee Ed Clark received 921,299 popular votes (1.06%).\n\nCarter's loss was the worst performance by an incumbent president since Herbert Hoover lost to Franklin Roosevelt by a margin of 18% in 1932, and his 49 Electoral College votes were the fewest won by an incumbent since William Howard Taft won eight in 1912. Carter was the first incumbent Democrat to serve only one full term since James Buchanan. This was the third and most recent presidential election in which the incumbent Democrat lost reelection, after 1840 and 1888. This was the first time since 1840 that an incumbent Democrat lost the popular vote. Reagan had the most lopsided Electoral College victory for a first-time president-elect, with the exception of George Washington's unanimous victory in 1788.[147]\n\nThis election was the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Georgia. It was the first time Massachusetts voted for a Republican candidate since 1956. 1980 is one of only two occurrences of pairs of consecutive elections seeing the incumbent presidents defeated, the other happening in 1892. This is the first time since 1892 that a party was voted out after a single four-year term, and the first for Democrats since 1896. This did not occur again for either party until 2020, and for the Democrats until 2024.\n\nReagan won 53% of the vote in reliably Democratic South Boston, one example of the so-called Reagan Democrat.[83] Although he won an even larger Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some now very strongly Democratic counties gave a Republican a majority or plurality. Notable examples are Jefferson County in Washington State, Lane County, Oregon, Marin and Santa Cruz Counties in California, McKinley County, New Mexico, and Rock Island County, Illinois.[148] Survey research and post-election polling indicated that the landslide result had been more a repudiation of Carter than an embrace of Reagan. But the public was aware that Reagan would move the nation in a more conservative direction, and was apparently willing to give it a chance to avoid four more years of Carter.[149]\n\nAt age 69, Reagan was the oldest non-incumbent to win a presidential election.

America is adrift. Our country moves agonizingly, aimlessly, almost helplessly into one of the most dangerous and disorderly periods in history.\n\nAt home, our economy careens, whiplashed from one extreme to another. Earlier this year, inflation skyrocketed to its highest levels in more than a century; weeks later, the economy plummeted, suffering its steepest slide on record. Prices escalate at more than 10 percent a year. More than eight million people seek employment. Manufacturing plants lie idle across the country. The hopes and aspirations of our people are being smothered.\n\nOverseas, conditions already perilous, deteriorate. The Soviet Union for the first time is acquiring the means to obliterate or cripple our land-based missile system and blackmail us into submission. Marxist tyrannies spread more rapidly through the Third World and Latin America. Our alliances are frayed in Europe and elsewhere. Our energy supplies become even more dependent on uncertain foreign suppliers. In the ultimate humiliation, militant terrorists in Iran continue to toy with the lives of Americans.\n\nThese events are not isolated, or unrelated. They are signposts. They mark a continuing downward spiral in economic vitality and international influence. Should the trend continue, the 1980s promise to be our most dangerous years since World War II. History could record, if we let the drift go on, that the American experiment, so marvelously successful for 200 years, came strangely, needlessly, tragically to a dismal end early in our third century.\n\nBy far the most galling aspect of it all is that the chief architects of our decline—Democratic politicians—are without program or ideas to reverse it. Divided, leaderless, unseeing, uncomprehending, they plod on with listless offerings of pale imitations of the same policies they have pursued so long, knowing full well their futility. The Carter Administration is the unhappy and inevitable consequence of decades of increasingly outmoded Democratic domination of our national life. Over the past four years it has repeatedly demonstrated that it has no basic goals other than the perpetuation of its own rule and no guiding principle other than the fleeting insights provided by the latest opinion poll. Policies announced one day are disavowed or ignored the next, sowing confusion among Americans at home and havoc among our friends abroad.\n\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents have been watching and reading these signs. They have been watching incredulously as disaster after disaster unfolds. They now have had enough. They are rising up in 1980 to say that this confusion must end; this drift must end; we must pull ourselves together as a people before we slide irretrievably into the abyss.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way; it doesn't have to stay this way. We, the Republican Party, hold ourselves forth as the Party best able to arrest and reverse the decline. We offer new ideas and candidates, from the top of our ticket to the bottom, who can bring to local and national leadership firm, steady hands and confidence and eagerness. We have unparalleled unity within our own ranks, especially between our presidential nominee and our Congressional membership. Most important, we go forth to the people with ideas and programs for the future that are as powerful and compelling as they are fresh. Together, we offer a new beginning for America.\n\nOur foremost goal here at home is simple: economic growth and full employment without inflation. Sweeping change in economic policy in America is needed so that Mr. Carter's promise of hard times and austerity—his one promise well kept—can be replaced with Republican policies that promise economic growth and job creation. It is our belief that the stagflation of recent years not only has consigned millions of citizens to hardship but also has bottled up the enormous ingenuity and creative powers of our people. Those energies will not be released by the sterile policies of the past: we specifically reject the Carter doctrine that inflation can be reduced only by throwing people out of work. Prosperity will not be regained simply by government fiat. Rather, we must offer broad new incentives to labor and capital to stimulate a great outpouring of private goods and services and to create an abundance of jobs. From America's grass roots to the White House we will stand united as a party behind a bold program of tax rate reductions, spending restraints, and regulatory reforms that will inject new life into the economic bloodstream of this country.\n\nOverseas, our goal is equally simple and direct: to preserve a world at peace by keeping America strong. This philosophy once occupied a hallowed place in American diplomacy, but it was casually, even cavalierly dismissed at the outset by the Carter Administration—and the results have been shattering. Never before in modern history has the United States endured as many humiliations, insults, and defeats as it has during the past four years: our ambassadors murdered, our embassies burned, our warnings ignored, our diplomacy scorned, our diplomats kidnapped. The Carter Administration has shown that it neither understands totalitarianism nor appreciates the way tyrants take advantage of weakness. The brutal invasion of Afghanistan promises to be only the forerunner of much more serious threats to the West—and to world peace—should the Carter Administration somehow cling to power.\n\nRepublicans are united in a belief that America's international humiliation and decline can be reversed only by strong presidential leadership and a consistent, far-sighted foreign policy, supported by a major upgrading of our military forces, a strengthening of our commitments to our allies, and a resolve that our national interests be vigorously protected. Ultimately, those who practice strength and firmness truly guard the peace.\n\nThis platform addresses many concerns of our Party. We seek to restore the family, the neighborhood, the community, and the workplace as vital alternatives in our national life to ever-expanding federal power.\n\nWe affirm our deep commitment to the fulfillment of the hopes and aspirations of all Americans—blacks and whites, women and men, the young and old, rural and urban.\n\nFor too many years, the political debate in America has been conducted in terms set by the Democrats. They believe that every time new problems arise beyond the power of men and women as individuals to solve, it becomes the duty of government to solve them, as if there were never any alternative. Republicans disagree and have always taken the side of the individual, whose freedoms are threatened by the big government that Democratic idea has spawned. Our case for the individual is stronger than ever. A defense of the individual against government was never more needed. And we will continue to mount it.\n\nBut we will redefine and broaden the debate by transcending the narrow terms of government and the individual; those are not the only two realities in America. Our society consists of more than that; so should the political debate. We will reemphasize those vital communities like the family, the neighborhood, the workplace, and others which are found at the center of society, between government and the individual. We will restore and strengthen their ability to solve problems in the places where people spend their daily lives and can turn to each other for support and help.\n\nWe seek energy independence through economic policies that free up our energy production and encourage conservation. We seek improvements in health care, education, housing, and opportunities for youth. We seek new avenues for the needy to break out of the tragic cycle of dependency. All of these goals—and many others—we confidently expect to achieve through a rebirth of liberty and resurgence of private initiatives, for we believe that at the root of most of our troubles today is the misguided and discredited philosophy of an all-powerful government, ceaselessly striving to subsidize, manipulate, and control individuals. But it is the individual, not the government, who reigns at the center of our Republican philosophy.\n\nTo those Democrats who say Americans must be content to passively accept the gradual but inexorable decline of America, we answer: The American people have hardly begun to marshal their talents and resources or realize the accomplishments and dreams that only freedom can inspire.\n\nTo those Democrats who say we face an \"age of limits,\" we ask: Who knows the limit to what Americans can do when their capacity for work, creativity, optimism, and faith is enhanced and supported by strong and responsive political leadership and ideals.\n\nTo those who, with Mr. Carter, say the American people suffer from a national \"malaise,\" we respond: The only malaise in this country is found in the leadership of the Democratic Party, in the White House and in Congress. Its symptoms are an incompetence to lead, a refusal to change, and a reluctance to act. This malaise has become epidemic in Washington. Its cure is government led by Republicans who share the values of the majority of Americans.\n\nRepublicans pledge a restoration of balance in American society. But society cannot be balanced by the actions of government or of individuals alone. Balance is found at society's vital center, where we find the family and the neighborhood and the workplace.\n\nAmerica will not, however, achieve any of these goals on its present course nor under its present leadership. The uncharted course of Mr. Carter will lead surely to catastrophe. By reversing our economic decline, by reversing our international decline, we can and will resurrect our dreams.\n\nAnd so, in this 1980 Republican Platform, we call out to the American people: With God's help, let us now, together, make America great again; let us now, together, make a new beginning.\n\nIt has long been a fundamental conviction of the Republican Party that government should foster in our society a climate of maximum individual liberty and freedom of choice. Properly informed, our people as individuals or acting through instruments of popular consultation can make the right decisions affecting personal or general welfare, free of pervasive and heavy-handed intrusion by the central government into the decisionmaking process. This tenet is the genius of representative democracy.\n\nRepublicans also treasure the ethnic, cultural, and regional diversity of our people. This diversity fosters a dynamism in American society that is the envy of the world.\n\nElsewhere in this platform we discuss the benefits, for society as a whole, of reduced taxation, particularly in terms of economic growth. But we believe it is essential to cut personal tax rates out of fairness to the individual.\n\nPresently, the aggregate burden of taxation is so great that the average American spends a substantial part of every year, in effect, working for government.\n\nSubstantial tax rate reductions are needed to offset the massive tax increases facing the working men and women of this country. Over the next four years, federal taxes are projected to increase by over $500 billion due to the Carter Administration's policies. American families are already paying taxes at higher rates than ever in our history; as a result of these Carter policies, the rates will go even higher. The direct and indirect burden of federal taxes alone, imposed on the average family earning $20,000, has risen to $5,451—over 27 percent of the family's gross income. During the Carter term, the federal tax alone on this family will have risen $2,000.\n\nThe Republican Party believes balancing the budget is essential but opposes the Democrats' attempt to do so through higher taxes. We believe that an essential aspect of balancing the budget is spending restraint by the federal government and higher economic growth, not higher tax burdens on working men and women.\n\nPolicies of the Democratic Party are taxing work, saving, investment, productivity, and the rewards for human ingenuity. These same tax policies subsidize debt, unemployment, and consumption. The present structure of the personal income tax system is designed to broaden the gap between effort and reward.\n\nTherefore, the Republican Party supports across-the-board reductions in personal income tax rates, phased in over three years, which will reduce tax rates from the range of 14 to 70 percent to a range from 10 to 50 percent.\n\nFor most Americans, these reduced tax rates will slow the rate at which taxes rise. This will assure workers and savers greater rewards for greater effort by lowering the rate at which added earnings would be taxed.\n\nThese reductions have been before the Congress for three years in the Roth-Kemp legislation. The proposal will not only provide relief for all American taxpayers, but also promote non-inflationary economic growth by restoring the incentive to save, invest, and produce. These restored incentives will in turn increase investment and help reinvigorate American business and industry, leading to the creation of more jobs. In fact, Governor Reagan and Congressional Republicans have already taken the first step. Working together, they have boldly offered the American people a 10 percent tax rate cut for 1981, which will stimulate growth in our economy, and a simplification and liberalization of depreciation schedules to create more jobs.\n\nOnce tax rates are reduced, Republicans will move to end tax bracket creep caused by inflation. We support tax indexing to protect taxpayers from the automatic tax increases caused when cost-of-living wage increases move them into higher tax brackets.\n\nTax rate reductions will generate increases in economic growth, output, and income which will ultimately generate increased revenues. The greater justification for these cuts, however, lies in the right of individuals to keep and use the money they earn.\n\nThe measure of a country's compassion is how it treats the least fortunate. In every society there will be some who cannot work, often through no fault of their own.\n\nYet current federal government efforts to help them have become counterproductive, perpetuating and aggravating the very conditions of dependence they seek to relieve. The Democratic Congress has produced a jumble of degrading, dehumanizing, wasteful, overlapping, and inefficient programs that invite waste and fraud but inadequately assist the needy poor.\n\nPoverty is defined not by income statistics alone, but by an individual's true situation and prospects. For two generations, especially since the mid-1960s, the Democrats have deliberately perpetuated a status of federally subsidized poverty and manipulated dependency for millions of Americans. This is especially so for blacks and Hispanics, many of whom remain pawns of the bureaucracy, trapped outside the social and economic mainstream of American life.\n\nFor those on welfare, our nation's tax policies provide a penalty for getting a job. This is especially so for those whose new income from a job is either equal to, or marginally greater than, the amount received on welfare. In these cases, due to taxes, the individual's earned income is actually less than welfare benefits. This is the \"poverty trap\" which will continue to hold millions of Americans as long as they continue to be punished for working.\n\nThe Carter Administration and the Democratic Party continue to foster that dependency. Our nation's welfare problems will not be solved merely by providing increased benefits. Public service jobs are not a substitute for employable skills, nor can increases in the food stamp program by themselves provide for individual dignity. By fostering dependency and discouraging self-reliance, the Democratic Party has created a welfare constituency dependent on its continual subsidies.\n\nThe Carter Administration has proposed, and its allies in the House of Representatives actually voted for, legislation to nationalize welfare, which would have cost additional billions and made millions more dependent upon public assistance. The Democrats have presided over—and must take the blame for—the most monstrous expansion and abuse of the food stamp program to date. They have been either unable or unwilling to attack the welfare fraud that diverts resources away from the truly poor. They have sacrificed the needy to the greedy, and sent the welfare bills to the taxpayers.\n\nWe categorically reject the notion of a guaranteed annual income, no matter how it may be disguised, which would destroy the fiber of our economy and doom the poor to perpetual dependence.\n\nAs a party we commit ourselves to a welfare policy that is truly reflective of our people's true sense of compassion and charity as well as an appreciation of every individual's need for dignity and self-respect. We pledge a system that will:\n\nProvide adequate living standards for the truly needy;\n\nEnd welfare fraud by removing ineligibles from the welfare rolls, tightening food stamp eligibility requirements, and ending aid to illegal aliens and the voluntarily unemployed;\n\nStrengthen work incentives, particularly directed at the productive involvement of able-bodied persons in useful community work projects;\n\nProvide educational and vocational incentives to allow recipients to become self-supporting; and\n\nBetter coordinate federal efforts with local and state social welfare agencies and strengthen local and state administrative functions.\n\nWe oppose federalizing the welfare system; local levels of government are most aware of the needs in their communities. We support a block grant program that will help return control of welfare programs to the states. Decisions about who gets welfare, and how much, can be better made on the local level.\n\nThose features of the present law, particularly the food stamp program, that draw into assistance programs people who are capable of paying for their own needs should be corrected. The humanitarian purpose of such programs must not be corrupted by eligibility loopholes. Food stamp program reforms proposed by Republicans in Congress would accomplish the twin goals of directing resources to those most in need and streamlining administration.\n\nThrough long association with government programs, the word \"welfare\" has come to be perceived almost exclusively as tax-supported aid to the needy. But in its most inclusive sense—and as Americans understood it from the beginning of the Republic—such aid also encompasses those charitable works performed by private citizens, families, and social, ethnic, and religious organizations. Policies of the federal government leading to high taxes, rising inflation, and bureaucratic empire-building have made it difficult and often impossible for such individuals and groups to exercise their charitable instincts. We believe that government policies that fight inflation, reduce tax rates, and end bureaucratic excesses can help make private effort by the American people once again a major force in those works of charity which are the true signs of a progressive and humane society.\n\nRepublicans recognize the very special sacrifice of those who have served in our nation's armed forces. Individual rights and societal values are only as strong as a nation's commitment to defend them. Because of this our country must never forget its appreciation of and obligation to our veterans.\n\nToday the veteran population numbers 30 million. This is the largest veteran population in our nation's history. We recognize the major sacrifices they have made for their fellow Americans.\n\nWe will maintain the integrity of the Veterans Administration. We will seek to keep it separate and distinct from other federal agencies as the single agency for the administration of all veterans' programs. In particular we feel it is of vital importance to continue and expand the health-programs provided to veterans through the Veterans Administration hospitals. Here we see the need for increased access to care, especially for older veterans.\n\nWe further advocate continued and expanded health care for our Vietnam veterans and consider it vital for the Veterans Administration to continue its programs for the rehabilitation of the disabled as well as its job training efforts.\n\nWe are committed to providing timely and adequate adjustments in compensation for service-disabled veterans and the survivors of those who died as a result of their service. We are also committed to maintaining the pension program for those who have served during a period of war, for those who were disabled and impoverished, and for their widows and orphans.\n\nWe will support measures to provide for every veteran at death a final resting place for his remains in a national cemetery, and for costs of transportation thereto.\n\nVeterans preference in federal employment in all departments and agencies will be continued and strictly enforced.\n\nRetired military benefits deserve more than the cursory attention given them by a Department of Defense otherwise interested in on-going programs. We believe that such benefits should be administered by the Veterans Administration.\n\nThe widespread distribution of private property ownership is the cornerstone of American liberty. Without it neither our free enterprise system nor our republican form of government could long endure.\n\nUnder Democratic rule, the federal government has become an aggressive enemy of the human right to private property ownership. It has dissipated savings through depreciation of the dollar, enforced price controls on private exchange of goods, attempted to enforce severe land use controls, and mistreated hundreds of thousands of national park and forest inholders.\n\nThe next Republican Administration will reverse this baneful trend. It will not only protect the cherished human right of property ownership, but will also work to help millions of Americans—particularly those from disadvantaged groups—to share in the ownership of the wealth of their nation.\n\nAmericans enjoy greater personal mobility than any other people on earth, largely as a result of the availability of automobiles and our modern highway system. Republicans reject the elitist notion that Americans must be forced out of their cars. Instead, we vigorously support the right of personal mobility and freedom as exemplified by the automobile and our modern highway system. While recognizing the importance of fuel efficiency and alternate modes of transportation, we quickly acknowledge that for millions of Americans there is no substitute on the horizon for the automobile. We reaffirm our support for a healthy domestic automobile industry, complete with continued support for the highway trust fund, which is the fairest method yet devised for financing America's highway system.\n\nRepublicans recognize the need for further improvement in highway safety. Projections indicate that highway fatalities may exceed 60,000 per year in the coming decades. Republicans support accelerated cost-effective efforts to improve highway, automobile, and individual driver safety.\n\nThe essence of freedom is the right of law-abiding individuals to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness without undue governmental intervention. Yet government in recent years, particularly at the federal level, has overwhelmed citizens with demands for personal information and has accumulated vast amounts of such data through the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Bureau of the Census, and other agencies. Under certain limited circumstances, such information can serve legitimate societal interests, but there must be protection against abuse.\n\nRepublicans share the concerns of our citizens as to the nature, use, and final disposition of the volume of personal information being collected. We are alarmed by Washington's growing collection and dissemination of such data. There must be protection against its misuse or disclosure.\n\nThe Republican Party commits itself to guaranteeing an individual's right of privacy. We support efforts of state governments to ensure individual privacy.\n\nFor millions of black Americans, the past four years have been a long trail of broken promises and broken dreams. The Carter Administration entered office with a pledge to 'all minorities' of a brighter economic future. Today there are more black Americans unemployed than on the day Mr. Carter became President. The unemployment rate of black teenagers is once again rising sharply. And the median income of black families has declined to less than 60 percent of white family income.\n\nRepublicans will not make idle promises to blacks and other minorities; we are beyond the day when any American can live off rhetoric or political platitudes.\n\nOur Party specifically rejects the philosophy of the Carter Administration that unemployment is the answer to inflation. We abhor the notion that our cities should become battlegrounds in the fight against inflation and that the jobs of black Americans should be sacrificed in an attempt to counterbalance the inflationary excess of government. Nor are we prepared to accept the practice of turning the poor into permanent wards of the state, trading their political support for continued financial assistance.\n\nOur fundamental answer to the economic problems of black Americans is the same answer we make to all Americans—full employment without inflation through economic growth. First and foremost, we are committed to a policy of economic expansion through tax-rate reductions, spending restraint, regulatory reform, and other incentives.\n\nAs the Party of Lincoln, we remain equally and steadfastly committed to the equality of rights for all citizens, regardless of race. Although this nation has not yet eliminated all vestiges of racism over the years we are heartened by the progress that has been made, we are proud of the role that our Party has played, and we are dedicated to standing shoulder to shoulder with black Americans in that cause.\n\nElsewhere in this platform, we set forth a number of specific proposals that will also serve to improve the quality of life for blacks. During the next four years we are committed to policies that will:\n\nEncourage local governments to designate specific enterprise zones within depressed areas that will promote new jobs, new and expanded businesses, and new economic vitality;\n\nOpen new opportunities for black men and women to begin small businesses of their own by, among other steps, removing excessive regulations, disincentives for venture capital, and other barriers erected by the government;\n\nBring strong, effective enforcement of federal civil rights statutes, especially those dealing with threats to physical safety and security which have recently been increasing; and\n\nEnsure that the federal government follows a non-discriminatory system of appointments up and down the line, with a careful eye for qualified minority aspirants.\n\nHispanics are rapidly becoming the largest minority in the country and are one of the major pillars in our cultural, social, and economic life. Diverse in character, proud in heritage, they are greatly enriching the American melting pot.\n\nHispanics seek only the full rights of citizenship—in education, in law enforcement, in housing—and an equal opportunity to achieve economic security. Unfortunately, those desires have not always been fulfilled; as in so many other areas, the Carter Administration has been long on rhetoric and short on action in its approach to the Hispanic community.\n\nWe pledge to pursue policies that will help to make the opportunities of American life a reality for Hispanics. The economic policies enunciated in this platform will, we believe, create new jobs for Hispanic teenagers and adults and will also open up new business opportunities for them. We also believe there should be local educational programs which enable those who grew up learning another language such as Spanish to become proficient in English while also maintaining their own language and cultural heritage. Neither Hispanics nor any other American citizens should be barred from education or employment opportunities because English is not their first language.\n\nThe Republican Party strongly believes that handicapped persons must be admitted into the mainstream of American society. It endorses efforts to enable our handicapped population to enjoy a useful and productive life.\n\nToo often in the past, barriers have been raised to their education, employment, transportation, health care, housing, recreation, and insurance. We support a concerted national effort to eliminate discrimination in all these areas. Specifically we support tax incentives for the removal of architectural and transportation barriers. We pledge continued efforts to improve communications for the handicapped and to promote a healthy, constructive attitude toward them in our society.\n\nWe acknowledge the legitimate efforts of those who support or oppose ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nWe reaffirm our Party's historic commitment to equal rights and equality for women.\n\nWe support equal rights and equal opportunities for women, without taking away traditional rights of women such as exemption from the military draft. We support the enforcement of all equal opportunity laws and urge the elimination of discrimination against women. We oppose any move which would give the federal government more power over families.\n\nRatification of the Equal Rights Amendment is now in the hands of state legislatures, and the issues of the time extension and rescission are in the courts. The states have a constitutional right to accept or reject a constitutional amendment without federal interference or pressure. At the direction of the White House, federal departments launched pressure against states which refused to ratify ERA. Regardless of one's position on ERA, we demand that this practice cease.\n\nAt this time, women of America comprise 53 percent of the population and over 42 percent of the work force. By 1990, we anticipate that 51 percent of the population will be women, and there will be approximately 57 million in the work force. Therefore, the following urgent problems must be resolved.\n\nTotal integration of the work force (not separate but equal) is necessary to bring women equality in pay;\n\nGirls and young women must be given improved early career counseling and job training to widen the opportunities for them in the world of work;\n\nWomen's worth in the society and in the jobs they hold, at home or in the workplace, must be re-evaluated to improve the conditions of women workers concentrated in low-status, low-paying jobs;\n\nEqual opportunity for credit and other assistance must be assured to women in small businesses; and\n\nOne of the most critical problems in our nation today is that of inadequate child care for the working mother. As champions of the free enterprise system, of the individual, and of the idea that the best solutions to most problems rest at the community level, Republicans must find ways to meet this, the working woman's need. The scope of this problem is fully realized only when it is understood that many female heads of households are at the poverty level and that they have a very large percentage of the nation's children.\n\nThe important secret about old age in America today is that it is primarily a woman's issue, and those over 65 are the fastest growing segment of the population. With current population trends, by the year 2020, 15.5 percent of our population will be over 65; by 2035, women in this age group will outnumber men by 13 million.\n\nIn 1980, 42 percent of women between 55 and 64 are in the work force. Half of the six million elderly women who live alone have incomes of $3,700 or less, and black women in that category have a median income of $2,600. How do they survive with the present rate of inflation? The lower salaries they earned as working women are now reflected in lower retirement benefits, if they have any at all. The Social Security system is still biased against women, and non-existent pension plans combine with that to produce a bereft elderly woman. The Republican Party must not and will not let this continue.\n\nWe reaffirm our belief in the traditional role and values of the family in our society. The damage being done today to the family takes its greatest toll on the woman. Whether it be through divorce, widowhood, economic problems, or the suffering of children, the impact is greatest on women. The importance of support for the mother and homemaker in maintaining the values of this country cannot be over-emphasized.\n\nIn other sections of this platform, we call for greater equity in the tax treatment of working spouses. We deplore this marriage tax which penalizes married two-worker families. We call for a reduction in the estate tax burden, which creates hardships for widows and minor children. We also pledge to address any remaining inequities in the treatment of women under the Social Security system.\n\nWomen know better than anyone the decline in the quality of life that is occurring in America today. The peril to the United States and especially to women must be stressed. Women understand domestic, consumer, and economic issues more deeply because they usually manage the households and have the responsibility for them. With this responsibility must also come greater opportunity for the achievement and total equality toward solution of problems.\n\nThe truths we hold and the values we share affirm that no individual should be victimized by unfair discrimination because of race, sex, advanced age, physical handicap, difference of national origin or religion, or economic circumstance. However, equal opportunity should not be jeopardized by bureaucratic regulations and decisions which rely on quotas, ratios, and numerical requirements to exclude some individuals in favor of others, thereby rendering such regulations and decisions inherently discriminatory.\n\nWe pledge vigorous enforcement of laws to assure equal treatment in job recruitment, hiring, promotion, pay, credit, mortgage access, and housing.\n\nMillions of Americans who trace their heritage to the nations of Eastern, Central, and Southern Europe have for too long seen their values neglected. The time has come to go beyond the ritual election year praise given to Ethnic Americans. We must make them an integral part of government. We must make recognition of their values an integral part of government policy. The Republican Party will take positive steps to see to it that these Americans, along with others too long neglected, have the opportunity to share the power, as well as the burdens of our society. The came holds true of our Asian-American citizens from the cultures of the Orient.\n\nAs a party we also recognize our commitment to Native Americans. We pledge to continue to honor our trusted relationship with them and we reaffirm our federal policy of self-determination. We support the assumption by Indians, Aleuts, and Eskimos themselves of the decisions and planning which will affect their lives and the end of undue federal influence on those plans and decisions.\n\nPuerto Rico has been a territory of the United States since 1898. The Republican Party vigorously supports the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted into the Union as a fully sovereign state after they freely so determine. We believe that the statehood alternative is the only logical solution to the problem of inequality of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico within the framework of the federal Constitution, with full recognition within the concept of a multicultural society of the citizens' right to retain their Spanish language and traditions. Therefore we pledge to support the enactment of the necessary legislation to allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise their right to apply for admission into the Union at the earliest possible date after the presidential election of 1980.\n\nWe also pledge that such decision of the people of Puerto Rico will be implemented through the approval of an admission bill. This bill will provide for the Island's smooth transition from its territorial fiscal system to that of a member of the Union. This enactment will enable the new state of Puerto Rico to stand economically on an equal footing with the rest of the states and to assume gradually its fiscal responsibilities as a state.\n\nWe continue to favor whatever action may be necessary to permit American citizens resident in the United States territories of the Virgin Islands and Guam to vote for President and Vice President in national elections.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the question of abortion, despite the complex nature of its various issues, is ultimately concerned with equality of rights under the law. While we recognize differing views on this question among Americans in general—and in our own Party—we affirm our support of a constitutional amendment to restore protection of the right to life for unborn children. We also support the Congressional efforts to restrict the use of taxpayers' dollars for abortion.\n\nWe protest the Supreme Court's intrusion into the family structure through its denial of the parent's obligation and right to guide their minor children.\n\nThe family is the foundation of our social order. It is the school of democracy. Its daily lessons—cooperation, tolerance, mutual concern, responsibility, industry—are fundamental to the order and progress of our Republic. But the Democrats have shunted the family aside. They have given its power to the bureaucracy, its jurisdiction to the courts, and its resources to government grantors. For the first time in our history, there is real concern that the family may not survive.\n\nGovernment may be strong enough to destroy families, but it can never replace them.\n\nUnlike the Democrats, we do not advocate new federal bureaucracies with ominous power to shape a national family order. Rather, we insist that all domestic policies, from child care and schooling to Social Security and the tax code, must be formulated with the family in mind.\n\nNext to religious training and the home, education is the most important means by which families hand down to each new generation their ideals and beliefs. It is a pillar of a free society. But today, parents are losing control of their children's schooling. The Democratic Congress and its counterparts in many states have launched one fad after another, building huge new bureaucracies to misspend our taxes. The result has been a shocking drop in student performance, lack of basics in the classroom, forced busing, teacher strikes, manipulative and sometimes amoral indoctrination.\n\nThe Republican Party is determined to restore common sense and quality to education for the sake of all students, especially those for whom learning is the highway to equal opportunity. Because federal assistance should help local school districts, not tie them up in red tape, we will strive to replace the crazy quilt of wasteful programs with a system of block grants that will restore decisionmaking to local officials responsible to voters and parents. We recognize the need to preserve, within the structure of block grants, special educational opportunities for the handicapped, the disadvantaged, and other needy students attending public and private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools.\n\nWe hail the teachers of America. Their dedication to our children is often taken for granted, and they are frequently underpaid for long hours and selfless service, especially in comparison with other public employees.\n\nWe understand and sympathize with the plight of America's public school teachers, who so frequently find their time and attention diverted from their teaching responsibilities to the task of complying with federal reporting requirements. America has a great stake in maintaining standards of high quality in public education. The Republican Party recognizes that the achievement of those standards is possible only to the extent that teachers are allowed the time and freedom to teach. To that end, the Republican Party supports deregulation by the federal government of public education, and encourages the elimination of the federal Department of Education.\n\nWe further sympathize with the right of qualified teachers to be employed by any school district wishing to hire them, without the necessity of their becoming enrolled with any bargaining agency or group. We oppose any federal action, including any action on the part of the Department of Education, to establish \"agency shops\" in public schools.\n\nWe support Republican initiatives in the Congress to restore the right of individuals to participate in voluntary, non-denominational prayer in schools and other public facilities.\n\nOur goal is quality education for all of America's children, with a special commitment to those who must overcome handicap, deprivation, or discrimination. That is why we condemn the forced busing of school children to achieve arbitrary racial quotas. Busing has been a prescription for disaster, blighting whole communities across the land with its divisive impact. It has failed to improve the quality of education, while diverting funds from programs that could make the difference between success and failure for the poor, the disabled, and minority children.\n\nWe must halt forced busing and get on with the education of all our children, focusing on the real causes of their problems, especially lack of economic opportunity.\n\nFederal education policy must be based on the primacy of parental rights and responsibility. Toward that end, we reaffirm our support for a system of educational assistance based on tax credits that will in part compensate parents for their financial sacrifices in paying tuition at the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary level. This is a matter of fairness, especially for low-income families, most of whom would be free for the first time to choose for their children those schools which best correspond to their own cultural and moral values. In this way, the schools will be strengthened by the families' involvement, and the families' strengths will be reinforced by supportive cultural institutions.\n\nWe are dismayed that the Carter Administration cruelly reneged on promises made during the 1976 campaign. Wielding the threat of his veto, Mr. Carter led the fight against Republican attempts to make tuition tax credits a reality.\n\nNext year, a Republican White House will assist, not sabotage, Congressional efforts to enact tuition tax relief into law.\n\nWe will halt the unconstitutional regulatory vendetta launched by Mr. Carter's IRS Commissioner against independent schools.\n\nWe will hold the federal bureaucracy accountable for its harassment of colleges and universities and will clear away the tangle of regulation that has unconscionably driven up their expenses and tuitions. We will respect the rights of state and local authorities in the management of their school systems.\n\nThe commitment of the American people to provide educational opportunities for all has resulted in a tremendous expansion of schools at all levels. And the more we reduce the federal proportion of taxation, the more resources will be left to sustain and develop state and local institutions.\n\nOur country's unequalled system of medical care, bringing greater benefits to more people than anywhere else on earth, is a splendid example of how Americans have taken care of their own needs with private institutions.\n\nSignificant as these achievements are, we must not be complacent. Health care costs continue to rise, farther and faster than they should, and threaten to spiral beyond the reach of many families. The causes are the Democratic Congress' inflationary spending and excessive and expensive regulations.\n\nRepublicans unequivocally oppose socialized medicine, in whatever guise it is presented by the Democratic Party. We reject the creation of a national health service and all proposals for compulsory national health insurance.\n\nOur country has made spectacular gains in health care in recent decades. Most families are now covered by private insurance, Medicare, or in the case of the poor, the entirely free services under Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans recognize that many health care problems can be solved if government will work closely with the private sector to find remedies that will enhance our current system of excellent care. We applaud, as an example, the voluntary effort which has been undertaken by our nation's hospitals to control costs. The results have been encouraging. More remains to be done.\n\nWhat ails American medicine is government meddling and the strait-jacket of federal programs. The prescription for good health care is deregulation and an emphasis upon consumer rights and patient choice.\n\nAs consumers of health care, individual Americans and their families should be able to make their own choices about health care protection. We propose to assist them in so doing through tax and financial incentives. These could enable them to choose their own health coverage, including protection from the catastrophic costs of major long-term illness, without compulsory regimentation.\n\nAmericans should be protected against financial disaster brought on by medical expenses. We recognize both the need to provide assistance in many cases and the responsibility of citizens to provide for their own needs. By using tax incentives and reforming federal medical assistance programs, government and the private sector can jointly develop compassionate and innovative means to provide financial relief when it is most needed.\n\nWe endorse alternatives to institutional care. Not only is it costly but it also separates individuals from the supportive environment of family and friends. This is especially important for the elderly and those requiring long-term care. We advocate the reform of Medicare to encourage home-based care whenever feasible. In addition, we encourage the development of innovative alternate health care delivery systems and other out-patient services at the local level.\n\nWe must maintain our commitment to the aged and to the poor by providing quality care through Medicare and Medicaid. These programs need the careful, detailed reevaluation they have never received from the Democrats, who have characteristically neglected their financial stability. We believe that the needs of those who depend upon these programs, particularly the elderly, can be better served, especially when a Republican Administration cracks down on fraud and abuse so that program monies can be directed toward those truly in need. In the case of Medicaid, we will aid the states in restoring its financial integrity and its local direction.\n\nWe welcome the long-overdue emphasis on preventive health care and physical fitness that is making Americans more aware than ever of their personal responsibility for good health. Today's enthusiasm and emphasis on staying well holds the promise of dramatically improved health and well-being in the decades ahead. Additionally, health professionals, as well as individuals, have long recognized that preventing illness or injury is much less expensive than treating it. Therefore, preventive medicine combined with good personal health habits and health education, can make a major impact on the cost of health care. Employers and employees, unions and business associations, families, schools, and neighborhood groups all have important parts in what is becoming a national crusade for better living.\n\nThe Republican Party recognizes that young people want the opportunity to exercise the rights and responsibilities of adults.\n\nThe Republican agenda for making educational and employment opportunities available to our youth has been addressed in detail in other sections of this platform.\n\nRepublicans are committed to the enactment of a youth differential in the minimum wage and other vitally needed incentives for the creation of jobs for our young.\n\nIn addition, we reaffirm our commitment to broaden the involvement of young people in all phases of the political process—as voters, party workers and leaders, candidates and elected officials, and participants in government at all levels.\n\nWe pledge, as we have elsewhere in this platform, efforts to create an environment which will enable our nation's youth:\n\nTo live in a society which is safe and free;\n\nTo pursue personal, educational, and vocational goals to the utmost of their abilities;\n\nTo experience the support, encouragement, and strength that come from maintenance of the family and its values; and\n\nTo know the stimulus of challenge, renewal through encouragement, provision of opportunities, and the growth that comes from responsible participation in numerous aspects of our society.\n\nInflation is called \"the cruellest tax.\" It strikes most cruelly at the elderly, especially those on fixed incomes. It strikes viciously at the sick and the infirm, and those who are alone in the world.\n\nInflation has robbed our elderly of dignity and security. An entire generation of responsible and productive citizens who toiled and saved a full working life to build up a retirement nest egg now finds that it cannot survive on its savings. Today's inflation rates dwarf yesterday's interest rates, and the pensions and annuities of our elderly citizens cannot keep up with the rising cost of living. Millions of once-proud and independent elderly Americans face a future of welfare dependency and despair.\n\nWe propose to assist families, and individuals of all ages, to meet the needs of the elderly, primarily through vigorous private initiative. Only a comprehensive reduction in tax rates will enable families to save for retirement income, and to protect that income from ravaging inflation. Only new tax exemptions and incentives can make it possible for many families to afford to care for their older members at home.\n\nPresent laws can create obstacles to older Americans' remaining in the family home. Federal programs for the elderly, such as Medicare and Supplemental Security Income, must address, humanely and generously, the special circumstances of those who choose to stay with thir families rather than enter a nursing home or other institution.\n\nSocial Security is one of this nation's most vital commitments to our senior citizens. We commit the Republican Party to first save, and then strengthen, this fundamental contract between our government and its productive citizens.\n\nRepublicans consider older Americans a community asset, not a national problem. We are committed to using the sadly wasted talents of the aged throughout our society, which sorely needs their experience and wisdom. To that end, and as a matter of basic fairness, we proudly reaffirm our opposition to mandatory retirement and our long-standing Republican commitment to end the Democrats' limitation on earnings for elderly Social Security recipients. In addition, the Republican Party is strongly opposed to the taxation of Social Security benefits and we pledge to oppose any attempts to tax these benefits.\n\nRepublicans have resisted Democratic electioneering schemes to spend away the Social Security trust funds for political purposes. Now the bill has come due, and the workers of America are staggering under their new tax burdens. This must stop.\n\nPrecisely because Social Security is a precious lifeline for millions of the elderly, orphaned, and disabled, we insist that its financing be sound and stable. We will preserve Social Security for its original purpose.\n\nThe problems of Social Security financing are only an aspect of the overriding problems of the economy which Democratic mismanagement has produced. There is but one answer, the comprehensive tax rate reduction to which Republicans are committed. To save Social Security, we have no choice but to redirect our economy toward growth. To meet this country's commitments to Social Security recipients, present and future, we need more people at work, earning more money, thereby paying more into the trust funds. That same growth can balance the federal budget with lower taxes, over time reducing inflation, which falls so cruelly on senior citizens whose income is fixed by the size of their public or private pension.\n\nWe pledge to clean up the much-abused disability system. We will also expand eligibility for Individual Retirement Accounts to enable more persons to plan for their retirement years.\n\nThe Republican agenda for welfare reform has been discussed in a previous section, but we think it important to stress that central to it is the preservation of the families the system is designed to serve. The current system does not do this. Neither would guaranteed annual income schemes. By supplanting parental responsibility and by denying children parental guidance and economic support, they encourage and reward the fragmentation of families. This is unconscionable. The values and strengths of the family provide a vital element in breaking the bonds of poverty.\n\nUltimately, the Republican Party supports the orderly, wholesale transfer of all welfare functions to the states along with the tax sources to finance them.\n\nIt is increasingly common for both husbands and wives to work outside the home. Often, it occurs out of economic necessity, and it creates major difficulties for families with children, especially those of pre-school age. On one hand, they are striving to improve the economic well-being of their family; on the other, they are concerned about the physical and emotional well-being of their children. This dilemma is further aggravated in instances of single parenthood due to death or divorce.\n\nRecognizing these problems, we pledge to increase the availability of non-institutional child care. We see a special role for local, private organizations in meeting this need.\n\nWe disapprove of the bias in the federal tax system against working spouses, whose combined incomes are taxed at a proportionately higher rate than if they were single. We deplore this \"marriage tax\" and call for equity in the tax treatment of families.\n\nWe applaud our society's increasing awareness of the role of homemakers in the economy, not apart from the work force but as a very special part of it: the part that combines the labor of a full-time job, the skills of a profession, and the commitment of the most dedicated volunteer. Recognizing that home-making is as important as any other profession, we endorse expanded eligibility for Individual Retirement Accounts for homemakers and will explore other ways to advance their standing and security.\n\nIn view of the continuing efforts of the present Administration to define and influence the family through such federally funded conferences as the White House Conference on Families, we express our support for legislation protecting and defending the traditional American family against the ongoing erosion of its base in our society.\n\nRepublicans will seek every effective means to enable families more easily to assist their handicapped members and to provide for their education and special medical and therapeutic needs. In the case of handicapped children particularly, flexibility must be maintained in programs of public assistance so that, whenever possible, these youngsters may remain at home rather than in institutions.\n\nTargeted tax relief can make it possible for parents to keep such a child at home without foregoing essential professional assistance. Similarly, tax incentives can assist those outside the home, in the neighborhood and the workplace, who undertake to train, hire, or house the handicapped.\n\nThe quality of American neighborhoods is the ultimate test of the success or failure of government policies for the cities, for housing, and for law enforcement.\n\nObsessed with the demands of special interest groups and preoccupied with the design of expensive \"comprehensive\" programs, the Democrats in Congress and the Administration have lost sight of that simple but important criterion. They have proposed more social and fiscal tinkering with our cities and towns.\n\nRepublicans will address the real problems that face Americans In their neighborhoods day by day—deterioration and urban blight, dangerous streets and violent crime that make millions of Americans, especially senior citizens, fearful in their own neighborhoods and prisoners in their own homes.\n\nIn the summer of 1980, Americans suffer a rising national unemployment rate, now at nearly eight percent, and double-digit inflation and interest rates. As Republicans meet in Detroit, the policies of the Carter Administration and the Democratic Congress have pushed the economy into recession and have resulted in unemployment approaching 20 percent in our host city.\n\nThe people of Detroit have worked long and hard to revitalize their city, and the evidence of its rebirth is impressive. Their efforts have been severely set back by Carter Administration policies outside or this or any city's control. The grim evidence is manifested in jobs lost as a direct consequence of bankrupt economic policies which have fostered this recession. Republicans will address and resolve the real problems of today's economy, problems that destroy jobs and deny even the hope of homeownership to millions of American families. We are, moreover, committed to nurturing the spirit of self-help and cooperation through which so many neighborhoods have revitalized themselves and served their residents.\n\nThe American ethic of neighbor helping neighbor has been an essential factor in the building of our nation. Republicans are committed to the preservation of this great tradition.\n\nTo help non-governmental community programs aid in serving the needs of poor, disabled, or other disadvantaged, we support permitting taxpayers to deduct charitable contributions from their federal income tax whether they itemize or not.\n\nIn contrast, the Democrats' assault against Meals-on-Wheels highlights their insensitivity to the neighborly spirit that motivates so many Americans. For over 25 years, voluntary Meals-on-Wheels organizations have been feeding needy homebound citizens—usually the elderly—with funding from local private charitable sources. Promising for the first time to \"help\" these neighborhood volunteer efforts in 1978, the Democratic Congress and Administration instead used the carrot of federal funding and the stick of federal regulation to crowd out private ventures.\n\nGovernment must never elbow aside private institutions—schools, churches, volunteer groups, labor and professional associations—in meeting the social needs in our neighborhoods and communities.\n\nThe city is the focus for the lives of millions of Americans. Its neighborhoods are places of familiarity, of belonging, of tradition and continuity. They are arenas for civic action and creative self-help. The human scale of the neighborhood encourages citizens to exercise leadership, to invest their talents, energies, and resources, and to work together to create a better life for their families.\n\nRepublican economic programs will create conditions for rebirth of citizen activity in neighborhoods and cities across the land. In a Republican economic climate, America's cities can once again produce, build, and grow.\n\nA Republican Administration will focus its efforts to revitalize neighborhoods in five areas. We will:\n\nCut taxes, increase incentives to save, restore sound money, and stimulate capital investment to create jobs;\n\nCreate and apply new tax incentives for employees and employers alike to stimulate economic growth and reduce red-tape for business ventures. Local government will be invited to designate specific depressed areas as jobs and enterprise zones;\n\nEncourage our cities to undertake neighborhood revitalization and preservation programs in cooperation with the three essential local interests: local government, neighborhood property owners and residents, and local financial institutions;\n\nReplace the categorical aid programs with block grant or revenue sharing programs and, where appropriate, transfer the programs, along with the tax sources to pay for them, back to the state and local governments; and\n\nRemain fully committed to the fair enforcement of all federal civil rights statutes and continue minority business enterprise and similar programs begun by Republican Administrations but bungled by overregulation and duplication during the Carter Administration.\n\nRepublican programs will revitalize the inner cities. New jobs will be created. The federal government's role will be substantially reduced. The individual citizen will reclaim his or her independence.\n\nThe revitalization of American cities will proceed from the revitalization of the neighborhoods. Cities and neighborhoods are no more nor less than the people who inhabit them. Their strengths and weaknesses provide their character. If they are to grow, it is the people who must seize the initiative and lead.\n\nOur citizens must have a real opportunity to live in decent, affordable housing. Due to the disastrous policies of the Carter Administration and the Democratic Congress, however, the goal of homeownership and all that aspiration entails is now in jeopardy. These irrational policies have been catastrophic to the housing industry. The highest home mortgage interest rates in the history of the United States have depressed housing starts to the lowest level since World War II. Democratic policies guarantee shortages in owner-occupied and rental housing.\n\nAs many as 1.4 million people who depend upon homebuilding for work may lose their jobs in this recession. Many already have. In addition to the toll taken on millions of American families, intolerable pressures will build on state, local, and federal budgets as tax revenues decline and expenditures increase to aid the unemployed.\n\nWe support financing and tax incentives to encourage the construction of rental housing as an essential addition to our housing inventory.\n\nProspective first-time home buyers simply cannot afford to buy. The affordability of housing has become a crisis. The high rates of inflation have driven mortgage payments, house prices, and down-payment requirements beyond the means of close to 80 percent of young American families. In order to assist the record number of young families who wish to become home buyers, we propose to implement a young family housing initiative, which would include several elements such as: urban homesteading, savings and tax reforms, and innovative alternate mortgage instruments to help meet monthly payment requirements without federal subsidies. To assist older homeowners, again without federal subsidy, we urge more extensive availability of the reverse annuity mortgage which allows older homeowners to withdraw the substantial equity they have built up in their homes and thus supplement their retirement income. In order to slow increases in housing costs, regulations which artificially limit housing production and raise housing costs must be eliminated.\n\nWe favor expansion of the Republican-sponsored urban homesteading program as a means of restoring abandoned housing. This innovative program is locally administered, returns property to the tax rolls, and develops new ownership and stability within our neighborhoods.\n\nThe collapse of new home production and the distress of the housing finance system are closely related. The stop and go economic policies of the past year have created extreme volatility in financial markets which have made it impossible for thrift institutions to supply housing credit at a reasonable cost.\n\nA set of policies aimed at higher and more stable levels of housing production will simultaneously reduce housing costs and unemployment in the economy. To assure a stable and continuous flow of funds for home mortgage financing, we pledge to allow responsible use of mortgage revenue bonds. We will work to change the tax laws to encourage savings so that young families will be able to afford their dreams.\n\nSpecifically, we will support legislation to lower tax rates on savings in order to increase funds available for housing. This will help particularly to make homeownership an accessible dream for younger families, encouraging them not to despair of ever having a home of their own, but to begin working and saving for it now. We oppose any attempts to end the income tax deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes.\n\nRepublicans will also end the mismanagement and waste that has characterized the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Carter Administration. As presently structured, HUD programs present local governments and developers with a maze of bureaucracy, complicated applications, and inflexible requirements, often unsuited to local needs. Such programs often infringe upon the right of local governments to retain jurisdiction over their own zoning laws and building codes. As a result, their cost is so high that relatively few of the needy are ultimately housed or helped. Republicans will replace many of HUD's categorical programs with decentralized block grants to provide more efficient and responsive housing assistance to the elderly, the handicapped, and the poor. In remaining programs, particular emphasis should be given to rehabilitation and preservation of existing housing stock as a priority in federal housing policy.\n\nSafety and security are vital to the health and well-being of people in their neighborhoods and communities. Republicans are committed to ensuring that neighborhoods will be safe places in which families and individuals can live, and we support and encourage community crime fighting efforts such as neighborhood crime watch and court monitoring programs.\n\nFirst, we believe that Republican economic proposals, more particularly those proposals which strengthen society and smaller communities discussed elsewhere in this document, will go a long way toward stabilizing American society.\n\nSecond, we support a vigorous and effective effort on the part of law enforcement agencies. Although we recognize the vital role of federal law enforcement agencies, we realize that the most effective weapons against crime are state and local agencies.\n\nJust as vital to efforts to stem crime is the fair but firm and speedy application of criminal penalties. The existence and application of strong penalties are effective disincentives to criminal actions. Yet these disincentives will only be as strong as our court system's willingness to use them.\n\nWe believe that the death penalty serves as an effective deterrent to capital crime and should be applied by the federal government and by states which approve it as an appropriate penalty for certain major crimes.\n\nWe believe the right of citizens to keep and bear arms must be preserved. Accordingly, we oppose federal registration of firearms. Mandatory sentences for commission of armed felonies are the most effective means to deter abuse of this right. We therefore support Congressional initiatives to remove those provisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 that do not significantly impact on crime but serve rather to restrain the law-abiding citizen in his legitimate use of firearms.\n\nIn recent years, a murderous epidemic of drug abuse has swept our country. Mr. Carter, through his policies and his personnel, has demonstrated little interest in stopping its ravages. Republicans consider drug abuse an intolerable threat to our society, especially to the young. We pledge a government that will take seriously its responsibility to curb illegal drug traffic. We will first and most urgently restore the ability of the FBI to act effectively in this area. Republican government will work with local law enforcement agencies to apprehend and firmly punish drug pushers and drug smugglers with mandatory sentences where appropriate. We support efforts to crack down on the sale and advertising of drug paraphernalia. Private, nonprofit drug abuse rehabilitation agencies have taken the lead in fighting drug abuse, and they deserve greater cooperation and flexibility from federal, state, and local agencies and grant programs. We pledge the enactment of legislation to ban the utilization of federal funds by grantees of the Legal Services Corporation to render their services in cases involving the pushing or smuggling of drugs as well as in cases of repeat offenders. We commend the religious leaders, community activists, parents, and local officials who are working with fervor and dedication to protect young Americans from the drug plague.\n\nThe complex problems of mobility, congestion, and energy resources demand creative solutions if we are to improve the living conditions of our urban areas. Many urban centers of our nation need dependable and affordable mass transit systems. The first line of responsibility must lie with the local governments. They must be given the latitude to design and implement the transportation system best suited to their singular circumstances. Republicans believe we should encourage effective competition among diverse modes of transportation. The role of the federal government should be one of giving financial and technical support to local authorities, through surface transportation block grants. Because of the long planning and construction times inherent in bus, rail, and other mass transit systems, a consistent and dependable source of revenue should be established.\n\nMass transportation offers the prospect for significant energy conservation. In addition, both management and labor agree that ease of access to the workplace is an important factor in employment decisions and industrial plant location. Lack of adequate access is a major reason why businesses have moved out of crowded urban areas, resulting in lower tax bases for cities. To encourage existing businesses to remain in urban centers and to attract new businesses to urban areas, it is vital that adequate public and private transportation facilities be provided.\n\nRepublicans recognize the importance of transportation in the rural areas of America.\n\nPublic transit is becoming more significant to rural areas as the costs of energy rise. While public transit will not replace the importance of private vehicles in rural America, it can serve as a vital adjunct to transportation in neighborhoods throughout rural America.\n\nWe propose to put Americans back to work again by restoring real growth without inflation to the United States economy. Republican programs and initiatives detailed in this platform will create millions of additional new jobs in the American workplace. As a result of Mr. Carter's recession, more than eight million Americans are now out of work.\n\nSweeping change in America's economic policy is needed. We must replace the Carter Administration's promise of hard times and austerity—one promise which has been kept—with Republican policies that restore economic growth and create more jobs.\n\nThe Democratic Congress and the Carter Administration are espousing programs that candidate Carter in 1976 said were inhumane: using recession, unemployment, high interest rates, and high taxes to fight inflation. The Democrats are now trying to stop inflation with a recession, a bankrupt policy which is throwing millions of Americans out of work. They say Americans must tighten their belts, abandon their dreams, and accept higher taxes, less take-home pay, fewer jobs, and no growth in the national economy.\n\nWe categorically reject this approach. Inflation is too much money chasing too few goods. Shutting down our nation's factories and throwing millions of people out of work leads only to shortages and higher prices.\n\nWe believe inflation can only be controlled by monetary and spending restraint, combined with sharp reductions in the tax and regulatory barriers to savings, investment, production, and jobs.\n\nThe need for growth and its impact on workers\n\nThe Republican Party believes nothing is more important to our nation's defense and social well-being than economic growth.\n\nSince 1973, the U.S. economy has grown in real terms at a rate of only 1.9 percent a year. This is barely half of the 3.7 percent annual growth rate we experienced between 1950 and 1973 and well below the 4.6 percent growth rate we enjoyed between 1961 and 1969. If our economy continues to grow at its current rate of less than two percent a year, our Gross National Product (GNP) will barely reach $3 trillion by 1990.\n\nBut if we can regain the growth we experienced during the economic boom of the 1960s, our GNP will reach nearly $4 trillion by the end of the decade, nearly one-third higher.\n\nWith this kind of economic growth, incomes would be substantially higher and jobs would be plentiful. Federal revenues would be high enough to provide for a balanced budget, adequate funding of health, education and social spending, and unquestioned military preeminence, with enough left over to reduce payroll and income taxes on American workers and retirees. Economic growth would generate price stability as the expanding economy eliminated budget deficits and avoided pressure on the Federal Reserve to create more money. And the social gains from economic growth would be enormous. Faster growth, higher incomes, and plentiful jobs are exactly what the unemployed, the underprivileged, and minorities have been seeking for many years.\n\nAll working men and women of America have much to gain from economic growth and a healthy business environment. It enhances their bargaining position by fostering competition among potential employers to provide more attractive working conditions, better retirement and health benefits, higher wages and salaries, and generally improving job security. A stagnant economy, which Democratic policies have brought about, decreases competition among business for workers, discourages improved employee benefits, reduces income levels, and dramatically increases unemployment.\n\nSavings and investment are the keys to economic growth. Only that part of national income which goes into savings and which is not consumed by government deficits is available to finance real economic growth.\n\nAmericans now save less than any other people in the Western world because inflation and the high rates of taxation imposed by the Carter Administration and the Democratic Congress have destroyed their ability and incentive to save and invest. This has strangled economic growth, choked off private initiative, pushed up prices, and retarded productivity and job creation.\n\nThe sharp drop in the growth of American productivity is the main reason why Americans' average real weekly earnings are no more than they were 19 years ago. This problem has worsened to the point that workers earn eight percent less in real purchasing power as the Carter term comes to a close than they did when it began.\n\nThe 25 years of Democratic domination of the Congress have cost us a generation of lost opportunities. The Carter Administration in particular has opposed every Republican effort to restore the health of the economy through lower taxes on work effort, savings, and the modernization of America's productive machinery.\n\nRepublicans are committed to an economic policy based on lower tax rates and a reduced rate of government spending.\n\nTherefore, the Republican Party pledges to:\n\nReduce tax rates on individuals and businesses to increase incentives for all Americans and to encourage more savings, investment, output and productivity, and more jobs for Americans;\n\nProvide special incentives for saving by lowering the tax rates on savings and investment income;\n\nRevitalize our productive capacities by simplifying and accelerating tax depreciation schedules for facilities, structures, equipment, and vehicles;\n\nLimit government spending to a fixed and smaller percentage of the Gross National Product; and\n\nBalance the budget without tax increases at these lower levels of taxation and spending.\n\nWe also oppose Carter proposals to impose withholding on dividend and interest income. They would serve as a disincentive to save and invest and create needless paper-work burdens for government, business, industry, and the private citizen. They would literally rob the saver of the benefits of interest compounding and automatic dividend reinvestment programs.\n\nUnless taxes are reduced and federal spending is restrained, our nation's economy faces continued inflation, recession, and economic stagnation. Tax fate reductions and spending restraint will restore the savings and investment needed to create new jobs, increase living standards, and restore our competitive position in the world.\n\nTo those individuals who have lost their jobs because of the Carter recession, we pledge to ensure that they receive their rightfully earned unemployment compensation benefits.\n\nThe Republican Party recognizes the need to provide workers who have lost their jobs because of technological obsolescence or imports the opportunity to adjust to changing economic conditions. In particular, we will seek ways to assist workers threatened by foreign competition.\n\nThe Democratic Administration's inability to ensure fairness and equity between our nation and some of our trading partners has resulted in massive unemployment in many core industries. As we meet in Detroit, this Party takes special notice that among the hardest hit have been the automotive workers whose jobs are now targeted by aggressive foreign competition. Much of this problem is a result of the present Administration's inability to negotiate foreign trade agreements which do not jeopardize American jobs. We will take steps to ensure competitiveness of our domestic industries to protect American jobs. But for workers who have already lost their jobs, we will provide assistance, incentives for job refraining and placement, and job search and relocation allowances. Toward this end, we will pursue specific tax and regulatory changes to revitalize America's troubled basic industries. We will also seek the aid of private individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations to formulate creative new self-supporting answers to training and placement problems as well as non-governmental sources of temporary financial support.\n\nThe Republican Party believes that protectionist tariffs and quotas are detrimental to our economic well-being. Nevertheless, we insist that our trading partners offer our nation the same level of equity, access, and fairness that we have shown them. The mutual benefits of trade require that it be conducted in the spirit of reciprocity. The Republican Party will consider appropriate measures necessary to restore equal and fair competition between ourselves and our trading partners.\n\nThe international exchange of goods and services must take place under free and unfettered conditions of market entry.\n\nUnemployment is a growing problem for millions of Americans, but it is an unparalleled disaster for minority Americans. As this country's economic growth has slowed over the past decade, unemployment has become more intractable. The gravity of the crisis is so severe that as we entered the present recession, unemployment was over six percent for the entire labor force but it was 33 percent for minority youth. In addition, the black unemployment rate was 10.8 percent and youth between the ages of 16 and 24 continued to account for about one-half of the total unemployed.\n\nDespite the almost $100 billion spent on well-intended public sector employment and training programs, the structural unemployment problem continues to fester among minorities and young people. In addition to providing a growth climate for job creation, specific and targeted programs must be developed to alleviate these problems.\n\nSince four out of every five jobs are in the private sector, the success of federal employment efforts is dependent on private sector participation. It must be recognized as the ultimate location for unsubsidized jobs, as the provider of means to attain this end, and as an active participant in the formulation of employment and training policies on the local and national level. Throughout America, the private and independent sectors have repeatedly helped in the creation of minority business through donated counseling and consulting services. They have encouraged equal opportunity hiring practices within their own industries and have built nonprofit, self-supporting training centers where the products produced during training are sold to support the programs.\n\nA coordinated approach needs to be developed which maximizes the use of existing community resources, offers adequate incentives to the private sector, focuses on both large and small business, and minimizes red tape.\n\nin recognizing the seriousness of the youth employment problem, Republicans also realize that a job alone will do very little to move a disadvantaged young person beyond the poverty line. Republicans support the creation of comprehensive programs for disadvantaged youth which would offer pre-employment training, education, instruction, and job placement and retention services. Republicans support efforts to establish and maintain programs which seek to match the needs of the private sector and our young people as efficiently and effectively as possible. We also support expansion of proven skill training practices, such as apprenticeship, as well as private schools and trade schools. These methods can provide quality training and point toward the acquisition of specific job skills leading to specific employment goals.\n\nWe will encourage and foster the growth of new organizations operated by public-private partnerships to help forge a closer link between the schools and private employers. These institutions can afford in-school and out-of-school disadvantaged youth the opportunity to upgrade basic skills, acquire work habits and orientation to work, and move directly from successful completion of the program to private unsubsidized jobs.\n\nWe believe that present laws create additional barriers for unemployed youth. One of the keys to resolving the youth unemployment problem is to reduce the cost to private employers of hiring young people who lack the necessary skills and experience to become immediately productive. Unfortunately, current government policy makes it too expensive for employers to hire unskilled youths. We urge a reduction of payroll tax rates, a youth differential for the minimum wage, and alleviation of other costs of employment until a young person can be a productive employee.\n\nSmall business is the backbone of the American economy, with unique strengths and problems which must be recognized and addressed. For more than half of all American workers, the workplace is a small business. Small business is family business both in the sense that many of them are owned and operated by single families, and also because most American families rely not only on the goods and services, but on the jobs produced there for their livelihood and standard of living.\n\nRepublicans have demonstrated their sensitivity to the problems of the small business community. The Carter Administration held a conference to learn what Republicans have long known. In the Congress, we have been working to pass legislation to solve small business problems and achieve the very goals later identified by that conference. A 1978 initiative by the late Representative Bill Steiger reduced the capital gains tax rates which were destroying capital formation in America. Under the leadership of Republicans in Congress, efforts to simplify and liberalize the restrictive depreciation schedule are a top priority. Another proposal long advocated by our Party is the drive to encourage the entrepreneur by reform of the regulatory laws which stifle the very life of business through fines, threats, and harassment. Republicans realize the immediate necessity of reducing the regulatory burden to give small business a fighting chance against the federal agencies. We believe that wherever feasible, small business should be exempt from regulations and, where exemption is not feasible, small business should be subject to a less onerous tier of regulation. We have offered legislation to reimburse small businessmen who successfully challenge the federal government in court. Republicans believe the number one priority for small business in America is the achievement of lower business and personal tax rates for small businessmen and women and we intend to work to secure them.\n\nAll of these initiatives will receive immediate attention from a Republican Administration and Congress. Without such changes as these, the small entrepreneur, who takes the risks which help make the economy grow and provides over 90 percent of all new jobs annually, will be an endangered species.\n\nBy fostering small business growth, we are promoting permanent private sector solutions to the unemployment problem. We will continue to provide for small business needs by enacting a substantial increase in the surtax exemption. The heavy estate tax burden imposed on the American people is threatening the life savings of millions of our families, forcing spouses and children to sell their homes, businesses, and family farms to pay the estate taxes. To encourage continuity of family ownership, we will seek to ease this tax burden on all Americans and abolish excessive inheritance taxes to allow families to retain and pass on their small businesses and family farms.\n\nWe will reform the patent laws to facilitate innovation and we will further this goal by encouraging a greater share of federal research and development be done by small businesses. Finally, we will reform those tax laws which make it more profitable to break up a small business or merge it into a conglomerate than to allow it to grow and develop as an independent business.\n\nThe Republican Party is committed to full employment without inflation. We will seek to provide more jobs, increase the standard of living, and ensure equitable treatment on the job for all American workers by stimulating economic growth.\n\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental principle of fairness in labor relations, including the legal right of unions to organize workers and to represent them through collective bargaining consistent with state laws and free from unnecessary government involvement. We applaud the mutual efforts of labor and management to improve the quality of work life.\n\nWage demands today often represent the attempt of working men and women to catch up with government-caused inflation and high tax rates. With the blessing of the Democrats' majority in Congress, the Council on Wage and Price Stability has put a de facto ceiling of seven to eight and one-half percent on workers' wages, while the Administration devalues their paychecks at a rate of 13 to 15 percent. The government, not the worker, is the principal cause of inflation.\n\nWe recognize the need for governmental oversight of the health and safety of the workplace, without interfering in the economic well-being of employers or the job security of workers.\n\nThe Republican Party reaffirms its long-standing support for the right of states to enact \"Right-to-Work\" laws under section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act.\n\nThe political freedom of every worker must be protected. Therefore, the Republican Party strongly supports protections against the practice of using compulsory dues and fees for partisan political purposes.\n\nThe Republican Party shares the concerns of consumers that there be full disclosure and fairness in the marketplace. We recognize that government regulation and taxes add significantly to costs of goods and services to the consumer, reducing the standard of living for all Americans. For example, safety and environmental standards, some of which are counterproductive, increase the average price of a new car by over $700. Compliance with those regulations alone costs motorists as much as $12 billion a year.\n\nFairness to the consumer, like fairness to the employer and the worker, requires that government perform certain limited functions and enforce certain safeguards to ensure that equity, free competition, and safety exist in the free market economy. However, government action is not itself the solution to consumer problems; in fact, it has become in large measure a part of the problem. By consistent enforcement of law and enhancement of fair competition, government can and should help the consumer.\n\nAn informed consumer making economic choices and decisions in the marketplace is the best regulator of the free enterprise system. Consumers are also taxpayers, workers, investors, shoppers, farmers, and producers. The Republican Party recognizes the need for consumer protection but feels that such protection will not be enhanced by the creation of a new consumer protection bureaucracy. Just as there can be no single monolithic consumer viewpoint, so the Republican Party opposes the funding of special self-proclaimed advocates to represent consumer interests in federal agency proceedings.\n\nThe Republican Party declares war on government overregulation. We pledge to cut down on federal paperwork, cut out excessive regulation, and cut back the bloated bureaucracy.\n\nIn addressing these problems we recognize that overregulation is particularly harmful to America's small businesses whose survival is often threatened by the excessive costs of complying with government rules and handling federal paperwork.\n\nWhile we recognize the role of the federal government in establishing certain minimum standards designed to improve the quality of life in America, we reaffirm our conviction that these standards can best be attained through innovative efforts of American business without the federal government mandating the methods of attainment.\n\nThe extraordinary growth of government, particularly since the middle 1960s, has brought mounting costs to society which, in turn, have added to inflationary pressures, reduced productivity, discouraged new investment, destroyed jobs, and increased bureaucratic intrusion into everyday life.\n\nRegulatory costs are now running in excess of $100 billion each year, or about $1,800 for every American family. Federal paperwork annually costs businesses from $25 to $32 billion. According to official figures, it takes individuals and business firms over 143 million man-hours to complete 4,400 different federal forms each year. Government regulation produces many indirect immeasurable costs as well and has led to increased bureaucratization of industry. Regulation also restricts personal choices, tends to undermine America's democratic public institutions, and threatens to destroy the private, competitive free market economy it was originally designed to protect.\n\nIn the face of a crisis of overregulation, the Carter Administration and the Democrats who control Congress have failed to recognize the problems facing workers, employers, and consumers and seem unable to come to grips with the underlying causes. While belatedly supporting transportation deregulation programs initiated by previous Republican Administrations, they have embarked on ambitious new schemes to tighten Washington's hold on energy and education. They have ignored or sidetracked Republican proposals to eliminate wasteful and outmoded spending programs and regulations. They have combined to push through more legislation and create additional programs which expand the size and power of the federal bureaucracy at the expense of ordinary taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. In contradiction to 1976 Carter campaign promises to cut back on regulation, the number of pages in the Federal Register devoted to new rules and regulations has increased from 57,072 in 1976 to 77,497 in 1979 and will approach 90,000 by the end of 1980.\n\nThe result of Democratic rule in both the White House and the Congress is that government power has grown unchecked. Excessive regulation remains a major component of our Nation's spiraling inflation and continues to stifle private initiative, individual freedom, and state and local government autonomy.\n\nThe Republican Party pledges itself to a comprehensive program of government reform. We propose to enact a temporary moratorium on all new federal regulations that diminish the supply of goods and services and add significantly to inflation. Such a moratorium will be consistent with the goal of achieving a safe and healthy working environment. We shall work to reduce substantially the regulatory and paperwork burdens on small businesses.\n\nWe encourage management and labor to form joint safety and health committees to make the workplace a better place to produce goods and services. At the same time we believe that the arbitrary and high-handed tactics used by OSHA bureaucrats must end. OSHA should concentrate its resources on encouraging voluntary compliance by employers and monitoring situations where close federal supervision is needed and serious hazards are most likely to occur. OSHA should be required to consult with, advise, and assist businesses in coping with the regulatory burden before imposing any penalty for noncompliance. Small businesses and employers with good safety records should be exempt from safety inspections, and penalties should be increased for those with consistently poor performance.\n\nIn no American workplace is there to be found greater productivity, cooperation, neighborly concern, creative use of applied science, information and relevant research, honesty, perseverance, hard work, and independence than on the farm and ranch.\n\nThe Republican Party takes pride in the ability of American farmers to provide abundant, high quality, and nutritious food and fiber for all our citizens including those most in need and to millions throughout the world, and at the same time to supply the largest single component in our export balance of trade.\n\nFour years of the Carter Administration and 25 consecutive years of a Congress controlled by Democrats have brought farmers and ranchers to the brink of disaster and the hardest times they have known since the Great Depression. In the last four years, more than 100,000 family farms have failed as farm income has plummeted. Even the present Administration's own figures show a decrease in real net farm income of some 40 percent in the last year alone—from $33 billion in 1979 to less than $22 billion projected for 1980.\n\nThe Democratic Party and the Carter Administration have abused their authority and failed in their responsibility to provide sound agricultural policies. Republicans pledge to make life in rural America prosperous again. We will:\n\nIncrease net farm income by supporting and refining programs to bring profitable farm prices with the goal of surpassing parity levels in a market-oriented agricultural economy;\n\nControl inflation by adopting sound fiscal and monetary policies and by eliminating excessive and unnecessary federal regulations;\n\nExpand markets at home by effectively utilizing the advantages of the energy potential for farm, forestry, and other biomass products. We encourage the continued innovative efforts in developing alcohol and other renewable energy sources and equipment for both on-farm and commercial use;\n\nAggressively expand markets abroad by effectively using the Eisenhower Food for Peace program and revolving credit incentives, working to remove foreign restraints on American products, and encouraging the development of dependable new markets in developing countries;\n\nAssure a priority allocation of fuel for U.S. agriculture, including food and fiber production, transportation, and processing; and\n\nCombine efforts to encourage the renewable resource timber production capability of privately-owned forests and woodlands with a federal program committed to multiple-use (timber, recreation, wildlife, watershed and/or range management) where federal land has not been designated as wilderness.\n\nAttention to the quality of life in our rural areas is a vital necessity because rural Americans impart a special strength to the national character. It is our goal to assure that all rural citizens—whether they are farmers or not—have the same consideration in matters of economic development, in energy, credit and transportation availability, and in employment opportunities which is given to those who live in towns and cities. The opportunity for non-farm jobs enhances the ability of people to live and work in rural America in the decade ahead, and our dedication to a prosperous and energetic rural America is part and parcel of our commitment to make America great again.\n\nAgriculture's contribution to the U.S. trade balance makes it especially fitting that an aggressive market development program to establish dependable new markets for farm exports will be a vital part of the policies to restore profitability to American agriculture. Republicans will ensure that:\n\nInternational trade is conducted on the basis of fair and effective competition and that all imported agricultural products meet the same standards of quality that are required of American producers;\n\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade becomes a meaningful vehicle for handling agricultural trade problems and grievances;\n\nAn aggressive agricultural market development program and the streamlining of the export marketing system is given top national priority;\n\nGovernment-to-government sales of agricultural commodities be eliminated, except as specifically provided by law;\n\nThe future of U.S. agricultural commodities is protected from the economic evils of predatory dumping by other producing nations and that the domestic production of these commodities, so important to the survival of individuals and small rural communities is preserved; and\n\nThe important and productive potential of the commercial seafood industry is given encouragement.\n\nWe support farmer-owned grain reserves, should they become necessary, and adamantly oppose government-controlled reserves.\n\nWe believe that agricultural embargoes are only symbolic and are ineffective tools of foreign policy. We oppose singling out American farmers to bear the brunt of Carter's ill-conceived, ineffective, and improperly implemented grain embargo. The Carter grain embargo should be terminated immediately.\n\nThe crushing burden of excessive federal regulations such as many of those imposed on farmers, ranchers, foresters, and commercial fishermen by OSHA, EPA, the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Interior, and other government entities are unrealistic and unnecessary.\n\nWe pledge a sensible approach to reduce excessive federal regulation that is draining the profitability from farming, ranching, and commercial fishing. Especially high on the agenda for changes in policy under Republican leadership are such regulatory issues as the Interior Department's ineffective predator control policies, EPA and FDA's excessive adherence to \"zero risk\" policies relative to the use of pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, food additives, preservatives, and the like.\n\nWe believe the strong soil and water conservation stewardship to which farmers, ranchers, watermen, and rural Americans are devoted is exemplary, and encourage appropriate local, state, and federal programs to give conservation practices vitality. Voluntary participation with adequate incentives is essential to the effective conservation of our soil and water resources.\n\nThe conservation and development of the nation's water resources are vital requisites for rebuilding America's national strength. The natural abundance of water can no longer be taken for granted. The impending crisis in water could be far more serious than our energy problems unless we act now. A dynamic water policy, which addresses our national diversity in climate, geography, and patterns of land ownership, and includes all requirements across the spectrum of water use, including Reclamation policy, will be a priority of the Republican Administration working with the advice and counsel of state and local interests. We must develop a partnership between the federal and state governments which will not destroy traditional state supremacy in water law. Further, there must be cooperation between the Executive Branch and Congress in developing and implementing that policy. Lack of such partnership has resulted in four years of bitter confrontation between the states and the obstructive policies of the Democratic Administration. The Congress has been frustrated in its efforts to conserve and develop our water resources. Working together, the states and the federal government can meet the impending water crisis through innovative and alternative approaches to such problems as cleaning our lakes and rivers, reducing toxic pollution, developing multiple-use projects, and achieving a workable balance between the many competing demands on our water resources.\n\nComprehensive labor legislation, which will be fair to American workers and encourage better relations with our neighbors in Mexico and Canada with whom we wish to establish a working North American Accord, is an essential endeavor. We deplore disruptive work stoppages which interrupt the supply of food to consumers.\n\nFederal estate and gift taxes have a particularly pernicious effect on family farms. Young farmers who inherit farm property are often forced to sell off part of the family farm to pay taxes. Once these taxes are paid, young farmers often must begin their careers deeply in debt. Our tax laws must be reformed to encourage rather than discourage family farming and ranching.\n\nWe deplore the imposition of present excessive estate and gift taxes on family farms. We support the use of lower, productivity-based valuation when farms are transferred within the family. Further, we believe that no spouse should pay estate taxes on farm property inherited from a husband or wife. We support the Republican tax cut proposal which provides accelerated depreciation and expanded investment tax credits to farm vehicles, equipment, and structures. Finally, we support legislation which would remove tax advantages foreign investors realize on the sale of U.S. forests, farmland, and other real estate.\n\nIt is essential to the well-being and security of our nation that an adequate rural transportation system be restored as a vital link between rural areas and their markets, both domestic and export. Overall, we pledge to eliminate those rules and regulations which restrict the free flow of commerce and trade of agricultural products and encourage an environment that will enhance the private development and improvement of all modes of transportation to move agricultural production swiftly, safely, and economically. Recognizing the inherent advantages of each mode of transportation, the Republican Party will work to encourage and allow those advantages to be utilized on a balanced and equitable basis.\n\nWe believe the federal 55 miles per hour speed limit is counterproductive and contributes to higher costs of goods and services to all communities, particularly in rural America. The most effective, no-cost federal assistance program available would be for each state to set its own speed limit.\n\nWe pledge an Administration dedicated to restoring profitability to agriculture. A top priority will be the selection of a qualified and effective Secretary and policy staff who will speak up for American farmers—and a President who will listen.\n\nAmerica's preeminence in agriculture is rooted in a system of agricultural research, extension, and teaching—unique and unequalled in the world. Land Grant Universities focus on problems of national, regional, and local concern. Cooperative extension, operating in every county of the United States and its territories, brings the results of USDA and Land Grant University research to farmers and ranchers, rural women, consumers, agribusiness, and to youth through 4-H programs.\n\nThe Republican Party favors a legislative effort to revise and modernize our food safety laws, providing guidelines for risk assessment, benefit assessment, peer review, and regulatory flexibility which are consistent with other government health and safety policies.\n\nWe believe farmer cooperatives and rural electric and telephone cooperatives provide essential benefits to farmers and the rural Americans they serve, and we support exclusive jurisdiction of USDA in the effective administration of the Capper-Volstead Act.\n\nWe Republicans pledge ourselves to work with farmers, ranchers, and our friends and neighbors to make America great again.\n\nThough a relatively young nation among those of western civilization, we are possessed of one of the oldest institutions of government extant. Steeped in the Judeo-Christian ethic and in Anglo-Saxon theories of law and right, our legal and political institutions have evolved over many generations to form a stable system that serves free men and women well. It governs a people of multifarious heritage dispersed across a great continent of marked geographical contrasts. It presides over a diverse economy that in its collective whole is the largest, most powerful, and most resilient in the world. In the two centuries of its life, though it has from time to time been sorely tested by constitutional, economic, and social crises, it has stood and not been found wanting. Its timeless strength, coupled with and reinforced by the faith and good will, the wisdom and confidence of the people from whom it derives its powers, has preserved us as a nation of enormous vitality.\n\nThe intent of the Founders, embraced and reflected by succeeding generations of Americans, was that the Central government should perform only those functions which are necessary concomitants of nationality, preserve order, and do for people only those things which they cannot do for themselves. The durability of our system lies in its flexibility and its accommodation to diversity and changing circumstance. It is notable as much for what it permits as for what it proscribes. Government must ever be the servant of the nation, not its master.\n\nUnder the guise of providing for the common good, Democratic Party domination of the body politic over the last 47 years has produced a central government of vastly expanded size, scope, and rigidity. Confidence in government, especially big government, has been the chief casualty of too many promises made and broken, too many commitments unkept. It is time for change— time to de-emphasize big bureaucracies—time to shift the focus of national politics from expanding government's power to that of restoring the strength of smaller communities such as the family, the neighborhood, and the workplace.\n\nGovernment's power to take and tax, to regulate and require, has already reached extravagant proportions. As government's power continues to grow, the \"consent of the governed\" will diminish. Republicans support an end to the growth of the federal government and pledge to return the decisionmaking process to the smaller communities of society.\n\nThe emergence of policies and programs which will revitalize the free enterprise system and reverse the trend toward regulation is essential. To sustain the implementation of such policy, it is necessary to raise the public awareness and understanding that our free enterprise system is the source of all income, government and private, and raise the individual's awareness of his or her vested interest in its growth and vitality.\n\nThe Republican Party believes that it is important to develop a growing constituency which recognizes its direct relationship to the health and success of free enterprise, and realizes the negative impact of excessive regulation. Education and involvement in the system are the best means to accomplish this. To this end, we will actively pursue new and expanding opportunities for all Americans to become more directly involved in our free enterprise system.\n\nThe Republican Party reaffirms its belief in the decentralization of the federal government and in the traditional American principle that the best government is the one closest to the people. There, it is less costly, more accountable, and more responsive to people's needs. Against the prevailing trend toward increased Centralization of government under the Democrats, Republicans succeeded in the 1970s in initiating large scale revenue sharing and block grant programs to disperse the power of the federal government and share it with the states and localities.\n\nOur states and localities have the talent, wisdom, and determination to respond to the variety of demands made upon them. Block grants and revenue sharing provide local government with the means and the flexibility to solve their own problems in ways most appropriate for each locale. Unlike categorical grants, they do not lock states and localities into priorities and needs perceived by Washington. They are also more efficient because block grants and revenue sharing relieve both local government and the federal government from the costly and complicated process of program application, implementation, and review associated with the categorical grant system.\n\nWe pledge to continue and redouble our efforts to return power to the state and local governments. The regionalization of government encouraged by federal policies diminishes the responsiveness of state and local governments and impairs the power of the people to control their destiny.\n\nWhile Republican efforts have been focused on sharing revenue and the power that goes with it, the Carter Administration has been preoccupied with the reorganization and consolidation of central authority. As a result, we have the Departments of Energy and Education, for example, but no more oil and gas, or learning, to show for it.\n\nWhen we mistakenly rely on government to solve all our problems we ignore the abilities of people to solve their own problems. We pledge to renew the dispersion of power from the federal government to the states and localities. But this will not be enough. We pledge to extend the process so that power can be transferred as well to non-governmental institutions.\n\nWe favor the establishment or a commission of distinguished citizens to recommend ways of reorganizing and reducing the size and scope of the Executive Branch. Federal departments, agencies, and bureaus should be consolidated where possible to end waste and improve the delivery of essential services. Republicans pledge to eliminate bureaucratic red tape and reduce government paperwork. Agencies should be made to justify every official form and filing requirement. Where possible, we favor deregulation, especially in the energy, transportation, and communications industries. We believe that the marketplace, rather than the bureaucrats, should regulate management decisions.\n\nThe unremitting delegation of authority to the rule-makers by successive Democratic Congresses and the abuse of that authority have led to our current crisis of overregulation. For that reason, we support use of the Congressional veto, sunset laws, and strict budgetary control of the bureaucracies as a means of eliminating unnecessary spending and regulations. Agencies should be required to review existing regulations and eliminate those that are outmoded, duplicative, or contradictory. They must conduct cost-benefit analyses of major proposed regulations to determine their impact on the economy, on public health and safety, on state and local government, and on competition. We recommend legislation which would eliminate the present presumption of validity in favor of federal regulations. We also support legislation to require the federal government to provide restitution to those who have been wrongfully injured by agency actions. We oppose the use of tax monies by any federal agency to pay the expenses of intervenors in the rule-making process.\n\nWe recognize that there are dangers inherent in the rapid growth of the federal bureaucracy, especially the arbitrary nature of its discretionary power and the abuses of procedural safeguards. Accordingly, we pledge to work for fundamental changes in the federal Administrative Procedures Act in order to give citizens the same constitutional protections before a government agency that they have in a courtroom. Among these reforms are requirements that agencies publish in the Federal Register all rules and statements of policy before they are adopted, that a person be guaranteed written notice and the opportunity to submit facts and arguments in any adjudicatory proceeding, that an agency decision be consistent with prior decisions unless otherwise provided by law, and that a person may seek judicial review without first exhausting his or her administrative remedies. At the same time we urge the Congress to strengthen its oversight to ensure that the agencies comply with the deadlines, report filing, and other requirements mandated by law.\n\nWe propose to repeal federal restrictions and rewrite federal standards which hinder minorities from finding employment, starting their own businesses, gaining valuable work experience, or enjoying the fruits of their own labors.\n\nBecause there are too many federal employees in comparison to private sector employees, there should be no further increase in the number of civilian federal employees if that would increase the ratio of federal employees to private sector employees over the present ratio.\n\nThe Republican Party has consistently encouraged full participation in our electoral processes and is disturbed by the steady decline in voter participation in the United States in recent years. We believe that the increased voter turnout during the past year in Republican campaigns is due to dissatisfaction with Democratic officials and their failure to heed popular demands to cut taxes, restrain spending, curb inflation, and drastically reduce regulation.\n\nRepublicans support public policies that will promote electoral participation without compromising ballot-box security. We strongly oppose national postcard voter registration schemes because they are an open invitation to fraud.\n\nRepublicans support public policies that encourage political activity by individual citizens. We support the repeal of those restrictive campaign spending limitations that tend to create obstacles to local grass roots participation in federal elections. We also oppose the proposed financing of Congressional campaigns with taxpayers' dollars as an effort by the Democratic Party to protect its incumbent Members of Congress with a tax subsidy. We prefer the present system of having the states and party rules determine the presidential nominating process to the concept of a uniform national primary which would only add to the already high costs of, and excessive federal intrusion into, presidential campaigns.\n\nWe support the critical roles of competitive political parties in the recruitment of candidates, the conduct of campaigns, and the development of broad-based public policy responsive to the people. We urge Congress and state legislatures to frame their regulations of campaign finance, their nominating systems, and other election laws to strengthen rather than weaken parties.\n\nRecent Republican Administrations led the way in bringing together private support and governmental encouragement to effect a tremendous expansion of artistic and scholarly endeavor. The Carter Administration has crudely politicized these programs, lowering their standards of excellence and increasing federal control over them.\n\nThe Republican Party will restore the sound economy which is absolutely necessary for the arts and humanities to flourish. We will restore, as well, the integrity of federal programs in this area. Most important, to ensure the continued primacy of private funding for the arts, we reiterate our support of broader tax incentives for contributions to charitable and cultural organizations.\n\nAmerica's transportation system must be designed to meet the requirements of the people, not to dictate what those requirements should be. Essential to any industrialized country is a transportation system which provides efficient and reliable service for both the movement of people and freight, urban and rural, domestic and foreign. Our nation has one of the finest transportation systems in the world but there is a danger that it will be unable to meet the future needs of a growing America.\n\nPresent levels of public and private investment will not preserve the existing system. For example, highways are deteriorating twice as fast as they are being rebuilt and inadequate rehabilitation will soon cost users more in reduced service levels than the cost of adequate rehabilitation.\n\nThe demand for transportation will grow dramatically in the next two decades with people-miles travelled increasing by over 50 percent and freight ton-miles more than doubling.\n\nGovernment overregulation is inhibiting the return on investment necessary to attract capital for future growth and jobs creation.\n\nA maze of federal agencies, Congressional committees, and conflicting policies is driving up costs and retarding innovation.\n\nA lackluster energy policy, impeding production of oil, coal, and other forms of energy is endangering transportation's ability to keep up with demand.\n\nConsequently, the role of government in transportation must he redefined. The forces of the free market must he brought to bear to promote competition, reduce costs, and improve the return on investment to stimulate capital formation in the private sector. The role of government must change from one of overbearing regulation to one of providing incentives for technological and innovative developments, while assuring through anti-trust enforcement that neither predatory competitive pricing nor price gouging of captive customers will occur.\n\nIncreased emphasis must he placed on the importance of having a well-balanced national transportation system where highways, passenger vehicles, buses, trucks, pipe-lines, and rail, water, and air transportation each provide those services which it does best, while offering the widest range of reasonable choices for both passenger and freight movement. A sound transportation system is a prerequisite for the vision of America that Republicans embrace—a prosperous, growing nation where dreams can still come true.\n\nEnergy is the lifeblood of our economy. Without adequate energy supplies now and in the future, the jobs of American men and women, the security of their lives, and their ability to provide for their families will be threatened and their standard of living will he lowered. Every American is painfully aware that our national energy situation has deteriorated badly over the past four years of Democratic control. Gasoline prices have more than doubled. Our oil import bill has risen 96 percent. Our energy supplies have become increasingly vulnerable because U.S. oil production outside of Alaska is now 28 percent below 1973 levels. The threat of sudden shortages, curtailments, and gas lines has become a recurring reality.\n\nThis steady deterioration has not only compounded our economic problems of inflation, recession, and dollar weakness, but even more importantly, it has infected our confidence as a nation. Energy shortages, spiralling costs, and increasing insecurity are beginning to darken our basic hopes and expectations for the future.\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has very accurately focused on the effects that a no-growth energy policy will have on the opportunities of America's black people and other minorities. The NAACP said that \"a pessimistic attitude toward energy supplies for the future...cannot satisfy the fundamental requirement of a society of expanding economic opportunity.\"\n\nIn commenting on the Carter energy proposals, the Association said, \"We cannot accept the notion that our people are best served by a policy based upon the inevitability of energy shortage and the need for government to allocate an ever diminishing supply among competing interests... (The plan) reflects the absence of a black perspective in its development.\"\n\nThree and one-half years ago, President Carter declared energy the \"moral equivalent of war\" and sent Congress 109 recommendations for action, including the creation of a new Department of Energy. Since then, the federal budget for government's energy bureaucracy has grown to about $10 billion per year and more then 20,000 pages of new energy regulations and guidelines have been issued. But these have not fostered the production of a single extra unit of energy.\n\nThe Democratic Congress has joined in the stampede, taking action on 304 energy bills since 1977. As a result, the federal bureaucracy is busy from coast to coast allocating gasoline, setting building temperatures, printing rationing coupons, and readying standby plans to ban weekend boating, close factories, and pass out \"no drive day\" stickers to American motorists—all the time saying, \"We must make do with less.\" Never before in the history of American government has so much been done at such great expense with such dismal results.\n\nRepublicans believe this disappointing cycle of shrinking energy prospects and expanding government regulation and meddling is wholly unnecessary. We believe that the proven American values of individual enterprise can solve our energy problems. This optimism stands in stark contrast to the grim predictions of the Democrats who have controlled Congress for the last 25 years.\n\nThey seem to believe not only that we are a nation without resources, but also that we have lost our resourcefulness. Republicans believe in the common sense of the American people rather than a complex web of government controls and interventions that threaten America's ability to grow. We are committed to an alternative strategy of aggressively boosting the nation's energy supplies; stimulating new energy technology and more efficient energy use; restoring maximum feasible choice and freedom in the marketplace for energy consumers and producers alike; and eliminating energy shortages and disruptions, which are a roadblock to renewed national economic growth, rising living standards, and a reawakening of the hopes and dreams of the American people for a better and more abundant future.\n\nWe believe the United States must proceed on a steady and orderly path toward energy self-sufficiency. But in the interim, our pressing need for insurance against supply disruption should not be made hostage to the whims of foreign governments, as is presently the case under the Carter Administration. We believe it is necessary to resume rapid filling of strategic oil reserves to planned levels of 500 million barrels in the short-term and ultimately to the one billion barrel level and to ensure that non-contiguous ares of the United States have their fair share of emergency oil reserves stored within their respective boundaries, as authorized by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.\n\nIn order to increase domestic production of energy, Republicans advocate the decontrol of the price at the well head of oil and gas. We believe that the so-called windfall profits tax (which is unrelated to profit) should be repealed as it applies to small volume royalty owners, new oil, stripper wells, tertiary-recovery, and heavy crude oil, and that the phase-out of the tax on old oil should be accelerated. This tax legislation should be amended to include a plowback provision. We will seek decontrol of prices on all oil products and an end to government authority to allocate petroleum supplies except in national emergency. We also believe that market restrictions on the use of natural gas should be eliminated.\n\nCoal, our most abundant energy resource, can bridge the gap between our other present energy sources and the renewable energy sources of the future. The coal industry has been virtually ignored by the Carter Administration and the Democratic Congress. In 1977, President Carter promised to double coal production by 1985. Instead, because of obstructionist actions of the Administration, coal production has increased by only 11 percent to date and future prospects are dim. Today, thousands of coal miners are out of work and without hope for the future.\n\nRepublicans support a comprehensive program of regulatory reform, improved incentives, and revision of cumbersome and overly stringent Clean Air Act regulations. This program will speed conversion of utility, industrial, and large commercial oil-burning boilers to coal to the greatest extent feasible, thus substantially cutting our dependence on foreign oil. This program must begin immediately on a priority basis and be completed at the earliest date possible.\n\nTo effectively utilize this vast resource, our coal transportation systems must be up-graded and the government controls on them relaxed. Government regulation regarding the mining and use of coal must be simplified. We will propose a policy which will assure that governmental restraints, other then necessary and reasonable environmental controls, do not prevent the use of coal. We also reaffirm that mined lands must be returned to beneficial use and that states, in accordance with past Congressional mandate, have the primary responsibility to implement rules concerning the mining of coal which are adapted to the states' unique characteristics.\n\nCoal, gas, and nuclear fission offer the best intermediate solutions to America's energy needs. We support accelerated use of nuclear energy through technologies that have been proven efficient and safe. The safe operation, as well as design, of nuclear generating plants will have our highest priority to assure the continued availability of this important energy source. The design and operation of these plants can be guaranteed in less than the 10 to 12 year lead time now required to license and build them. We believe that the licensing process can and should be streamlined through consolidation of the present process and the use of standardized reactor designs.\n\nThe Three Mile Island incident suggests the need for certain reforms, such as in the area of operator training, but illustrates that properly designed and operated nuclear plants do not endanger public health or safety. We further encourage the research, development, and demonstration of the breeder reactor, with its potential for safely contributing to our nation's future energy supplies.\n\nNuclear power development requires sound plans for nuclear waste disposal and storage and reprocessing of spent fuel. Technical solutions to these problems exist, and decisive federal action to choose and implement solutions is essential. The Democratic-controlled Congress and Administration have failed to address the spent fuel problem. A Republican Congress and Administration will immediately begin to implement plans for regional away-from-reactor storage of spent fuel with the goal of implementation of a program no later than 1984.\n\nRepublicans are committed to the rapid development of permanent storage facilities for nuclear wastes. Since waste disposal is a national responsibility, no state should bear an unacceptable share of this responsibility.\n\nRepublicans will also move toward reprocessing of spent fuel.\n\nRepublicans will continue to support the development of new technologies to develop liquid, gaseous, and solid hydrocarbons which can be derived from coal, oil shale, and tar sands. The decontrol of oil and gas prices will eliminate any necessity for government support for a synthetic fuel industry except possibly for limited demonstration projects. Clean air, water, waste disposal, mine reclamation, and leasing rules must be made rational and final to accelerate private investment.\n\nGasohol is an important, immediately available source of energy that is helping to extend our petroleum reserves. We encourage development of a domestic gasohol industry.\n\nWe also believe the government must continue supporting productive research to speed the development of renewable energy technologies, including solar energy, geothermal, wind, nuclear fusion, alcohol synthesis, and biomass, to provide the next generation of energy sources.\n\nConservation clearly plays a vital role in the consideration and formulation of national energy policy. Republicans reject, however, the position of the Democrats which is to conserve through government fiat, Republicans understand that free markets based on the collective priorities and judgments of individual consumers will efficiently allocate the energy supplies to their most highly valued uses. We also believe that the role of government is best performed by structuring creative cost-effective incentives to achieve energy efficiency and conservation.\n\nWe reject unequivocally punitive gasoline and other energy taxes designed to artificially suppress energy consumption.\n\nMuch inefficient energy use results from government subsidization of imported oil and holding the price of natural gas substantially below its market value. When the price of energy is held artificially low, there is no incentive for conservation. This kind of energy consumption stems not from the excesses of the public, but the foolish policy distortions of government. Every BTU of genuine energy \"waste\" in our economy would rapidly disappear if we immediately and completely dismantle all remaining energy price controls and subsidies.\n\nA Republican policy of decontrol, development of our domestic energy resources, and incentives for new supply and conservation technologies will substantially reduce our dependence on imported oil. We reject the Carter Administration's incessant excuse that the high price of imported oil and OPEC are the primary cause of inflation and recession at home and a weak dollar and declining balance of payments abroad. The fastest way to bring international oil prices under control is to stop printing so recklessly the dollars in which those prices are denominated. Fully 60 percent of the world oil price increase since 1973 represents the depreciation of our dollars rather than an increase in the real price of oil.\n\nVirtually all major environmental legislation in the past decade reflected a bipartisan concern over the need to maintain a clean and healthful environment. While the new environmental policies have resulted in improving air quality, cleaner waters, and more careful analysis of toxic chemicals, the price paid has far exceeded the direct and necessary cost of designing and installing new control technology. In the energy area, the increased complexity of regulations, together with continual changes in the standards imposed, have brought about tremendous delays in the planning and construction of new facilities ranging from electric power plants to oil refineries, pipelines, and synthetic fuel plants.\n\nRepublicans believe that an effective balance between energy and environmental goals can be achieved. We can ensure that government requirements are firmly grounded on the best scientific evidence available, that they are enforced evenhandedly and predictably, and that the process of their development and enforcement has finality.\n\nRepublicans condemn the Democrats' withdrawal of a massive amount of the most promising federal lands from prospective energy development, including the rich potential of our Outer Continental shelf. It has been estimated that by the end of the 1980s resources from government-controlled acreage could yield over two million barrels of oil per day and four trillion cubic feet of gas per year, the equivalent of nearly all of our imports from OPEC countries. It is clear that restrictive leasing policies have driven us further to depend on OPEC by severely impairing the exploration for, and development of, domestic oil, gas, and coal resources, thereby aggravating our balance of trade deficit and making our country less secure. Republicans will move toward making available all suitable federal lands for multiple use purposes including exploration and production of energy resources.\n\nRepublicans believe that in order to address our energy problem we must maximize our domestic energy production capability. In the short term, therefore, the nation must move forward on all fronts simultaneously, including oil and gas, coal, and nuclear. In the longer term, renewable resources must be brought significantly on line to replace conventional sources. Finally, in conjunction with this all-out production initiative, we must strive to maximize conservation and the efficient use of energy.\n\nThe return to the traditions that gave vitality and strength to this nation is urgent.\n\nThe free world—indeed western civilization—needs a strong United States. That strength requires a prospering economy. That economy will be secure with a vigorous domestic energy industry. That vigor can only be achieved in an atmosphere of freedom—one that encourages individual initiatives and personal resourcefulness.\n\nThe Republican Party reaffirms its long-standing commitment to the conservation and wise management of America's renewable natural resources.\n\nWe believe that a healthy environment is essential to the present and future well-being of our people, and to sustainable national growth.\n\nThe nature of environmental pollution is such that a government role is necessary to ensure its control and the proper protection of public health. Much progress has been made in achieving the goals of clean air, clean water, and control of toxic wastes. At the same time, we believe that it is imperative that environmental laws and regulations be reviewed and, where necessary, reformed to ensure that the benefits achieved justify the costs imposed. Too often, current regulations are so rigid and narrow that even individual innovations that improve the environment cannot be implemented. We believe, in particular, that regulatory procedures must be reformed to expedite decisionmaking. Endless delay harms both the environment and the economy.\n\nWe strongly affirm that environmental protection must not become a cover for a \"no-growth\" policy and a shrinking economy. Our economy can continue to grow in an acceptable environment.\n\nWe believe that agricultural policy should give emphasis to the stewardship of the nation's soil and water resources. The permanent loss of productive farm land is a growing problem and we encourage states and local communities to adopt policies that help maintain and protect productive agricultural land as a national asset.\n\nResidence in the United States is one of the most precious and valued of conditions. The traditional hospitality of the American people has been severely tested by recent events, but it remains the strongest in the world. Republicans are proud that our people have opened their arms and hearts to strangers from abroad and we favor an immigration and refugee policy which is consistent with this tradition. We believe that to the fullest extent possible those immigrants should be admitted who will make a positive contribution to America and who are willing to accept the fundamental American values and way of life. At the same time, United States immigration and refugee policy must reflect the interests of our national security and economic well-being. Immigration into this country must not be determined solely by foreign governments or even by the millions of people around the world who wish to come to America. The federal government has a duty to adopt immigration laws and follow enforcement procedures which will fairly and effectively implement the immigration policy desired by the American people.\n\nThe immediate adoption of this policy is essential to an orderly approach to the great problem of oppressed people seeking entry, so that the deserving can be accepted in America without adding to their hardships.\n\nThe refugee problem is an international problem and every effort should be made to coordinate plans for absorbing refugee populations with regional bodies, such as the Organization of American States and the Association of South East Asian Nations, on a global basis.\n\nUnder Mr. Carter, many, appointments to federal judgeships have been particularly disappointing. By his partisan nominations, he has violated his explicit campaign promise of 1976 and has blatantly disregarded the public interest. We pledge to reverse that deplorable trend, through the appointment of women and men who respect and reflect the values of the American people, and whose judicial philosophy is characterized by the highest regard for protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens, and is consistent with the belief in the decentralization of the federal government and efforts to return decisionmaking power to state and local elected officials.\n\nWe will work for the appointment of judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human life.\n\nElsewhere in this platform, we have pledged for the sale of individual freedom and economic growth to cut personal income tax rates for all. Republicans believe that these tax rate reductions should be complemented by firm limitations on the growth of federal spending as provided by the Roth-Kemp Bill. The Republican Party, therefore, pledges to place limits on federal spending as a percent of the Gross National Product. It is now over 21 percent. We pledge to reduce it. If federal spending is reduced as tax cuts are phased in, there will be sufficient budget surpluses to fund the tax cuts, and allow for reasonable growth in necessary program spending.\n\nBy increasing economic growth, tax rate reduction will reduce the need for government spending on unemployment, welfare, and public jobs programs. However, the Republican Party will also halt excessive government spending by eliminating waste, fraud, and duplication.\n\nWe believe that the Congressional budget process has failed to control federal spending. Indeed, because of its big spending bias, the budget process has actually contributed to higher levels of social spending, has prevented necessary growth in defense spending, and has been used to frustrate every Republican attempt to lower tax rates to promote economic growth.\n\nThe immediate burden of reducing federal spending rests on the shoulders of the President and the Congress. We believe a Republican President and a Republican Congress can balance the budget and reduce spending through legislative actions, eliminating the necessity for a Constitutional amendment to compel it. However, if necessary, the Republican Party will seek to adopt a Constitutional amendment to limit federal spending and balance the budget, except in time of national emergency as determined by a two-thirds vote of Congress.\n\nNot only has the Democratic Congress failed to control spending, but in the last 10 years federal credit assistance programs have soared out of control.\n\nMany federal loan guarantees and related credit programs are off-budget. As a result, no one knows the nature and extent of our obligations or the effect such practices have on our economy. The best estimate is that outstanding federal credit is now close to $600 billion.\n\nRunaway government lending can be just as dangerous as runaway federal spending.\n\nThe Republican Party will establish a workable federal credit policy that will bring order to the reckless lending practices of the past.\n\nWe consider inflation and its impact on jobs to be the greatest domestic threat facing our nation today. Mr. Carter must go! For what he has done to the dollar; for what he has done to the life savings of millions of Americans; for what he has done to retirees seeking a secure old age; for what he has done to young families aspiring to a home, an education for their children, and a rising living standard, Mr. Carter must not have another four years in office.\n\nIn his three and one-half years in office, Mr. Carter has presented and supported policies which carried inflation from 4.8 percent in 1976 to a peak of 18 percent during 1980.\n\nHe has fostered a 50 percent increase in federal spending, an increase of more than $200 billion, boosting spending in an era of scarce resources, and driving up prices.\n\nHe has through both inaction and deliberate policy permitted or forced tax increases of more than 70 percent, more than $250 billion, directly increasing the cost of living and the costs of hiring and producing. This has crippled living standards, productivity, and our ability to compete in the world. It has led to reduced output, scarcity, and higher prices.\n\nHe has imposed burdensome regulations and controls on production which have reduced the availability of domestic goods and energy resources, increased our dependence on imports, particularly in the energy area, driven down the value of the dollar, and driven up prices.\n\nHe has permitted continuing federal budget deficits and increased federal borrowing, forcing higher interest rates and inflationary money creation, increasing prices.\n\nThe inflation policies of the Carter Administration have been inconsistent, counterproductive, and tragically inept. Mr. Carter has blamed everyone from OPEC to the American people themselves for this crisis of inflation—everyone, that is, but his own Administration and its policies which have been the true cause of inflation.\n\nInflation is too much money chasing too few goods. Much can be done to increase the growth of real output. But ultimately price stability requires a non-inflationary rate of growth of the money supply in line with the real growth of the economy. If the supply of dollars rapidly outstrips the quantity of goods, year in, year out, inflation is inevitable.\n\nUltimately, inflation is a decline in the value of the dollar, the monetary standard, in terms of the goods it can buy. Until the decade of the 1970s, monetary policy was automatically linked to the overriding objective of maintaining a stable dollar value. The severing of the dollar's link with real commodities in the 1960s and 1970s, in order to pursue economic goals other than dollar stability, has unleashed hyper-inflationary forces at home and monetary disorder abroad, without bringing any of the desired economic benefits. One of the most urgent tasks in the period ahead will be the restoration of a dependable monetary standard—that is, an end to inflation.\n\nLower tax rates, less spending, and a balanced budget are the keys to maintaining real growth and full employment as we end inflation by putting our monetary policy back on track. Monetary and fiscal policy must each play its part if we are to achieve our joint goals of full employment and price stability.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Carter and the Democratic Congress seek to derail our nation's money creation policies by taking away the independence of the Federal Reserve Board. The same people who have so massively expanded government spending should not be allowed politically to dominate our monetary policy. The independence of the Federal Reserve System must be preserved.\n\nThe Republican Party believes inflation can be controlled only by fiscal and monetary restraint, combined with sharp reductions in the tax and regulatory disincentives for savings, investment, and productivity. Therefore, the Republican Party opposes the imposition of wage and price controls and credit controls.\n\nControls will not stop inflation, as past experience has shown. Wage and price controls will only result in shortages, inequities, black markets, and ultimately higher prices. We reject this short-sighted and misguided approach.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s, the United States faces the most serious challenge to its survival in the two centuries of its existence. Our ability to meet this challenge demands a foreign policy firmly rooted in principle. Our economic and social welfare in the 1980s may depend as much on our foreign and defense policy as it does on domestic policy. The Republican Party reasserts that it is the solemn purpose of our foreign policy to secure the people and free institutions of our nation against every peril; to hearten and fortify the love of freedom everywhere in the world; and to achieve a secure environment in the world in which freedom, democracy, and justice may flourish.\n\nFor three and one-half years, the Carter Administration has been without a coherent strategic concept to guide foreign policy, oblivious to the scope and magnitude of the threat posed to our security, and devoid of competence to provide leadership and direction to the free world. The Administration's conduct of foreign policy has undermined our friends abroad, and led our meet dangerous adversaries to miscalculate the willingness of the American people to resist aggression. Republicans support a policy of peace through strength; weakness provokes aggression.\n\nFor three and one-half years the Carter Administration has given us a foreign policy not of constancy and credibility, but of chaos, confusion, and failure. It has produced an image of our country as a vacillating and reactive nation, unable to define its place in the world, the goals it seeks, or the means to pursue them. Despite the Administration's rhetoric, the most flagrant offenders of human rights including the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and Cuba have been the beneficiaries of Administration good will, while nations friendly to the United States have suffered the loss of U.S. commercial access and economic and military assistance.\n\nThe threat to the United States and its allies is not only a military one. We face a threat from international terrorism. Our access to energy and raw material resources is challenged by civil unrest, Soviet-sponsored subversion, and economic combinations in restraint of free trade. Our first line of defense, our network of friendly nations and alliances, has been undermined by the inept conduct of foreign affairs.\n\nAmerican policy since World War II has rested upon the pillars of collective security, military and technological superiority, and economic strength, and upon the perception by our adversaries that the United States possesses the will to use its power where necessary to protect its freedom. These tenets have enabled a commonwealth of free and independent nations to enjoy the benefits and confidence that come from expanding economic interchange in peace and bilateral and multilateral support in time of war. The entire structure of peace was guaranteed by American and allied military power sufficient to deter conflict, or to prevail in conflict if deterrence should fail.\n\nThe Administration's neglect of America's defense posture in the face of overwhelming evidence of a threatening military buildup is without parallel since the 1930s. The scope and magnitude of the growth of Soviet military power threatens American interest at every level, from the nuclear threat to our survival, to our ability to protect the lives and property of American citizens abroad.\n\nDespite clear danger signals indicating that Soviet nuclear power would overtake that of the United States by the early 1980s, threatening the survival of the United States and making possible, for the first time in post-war history, political coercion and defeat, the Administration reduced the size and capability of our nuclear forces.\n\nDespite clear danger signals indicating that the Soviet Union was using Cuban, East German, and now Nicaraguan, as well as its own, military forces to extend its power to Africa, Asia, and the Western Hemisphere, the Administration often undermined the very governments under attack. As a result, a clear and present danger threatens the energy and raw material lifelines of the Western world.\n\nDespite clear danger signals indicating that the Soviet Union was augmenting its military threat to the nations of Western Europe, American defense programs such as the enhanced radiation warhead and cruise missiles, which could have offset that buildup, were cancelled or delayed—to the dismay of allies who depend upon American military power for their security.\n\nThe evidence of the Soviet threat to American security has never been more stark and unambiguous, nor has any President ever been more oblivious to this threat and its potential consequences.\n\nThe entire Western world faces complex and multi-dimensional threats to its access to energy and raw material resources. The growth of Soviet military power poses a direct threat to the petroleum resources of the Persian Gulf now that its military forces deployed in Afghanistan are less than 300 miles from the Straits of Hormuz, through which half the free world's energy supplies flow.\n\nSoviet efforts to gain bases in areas astride the major sea lanes of the world have been successful due to their use of military power, either directly or indirectly or through Cuban and other Soviet bloc forces. Since the Carter Administration took office in 1977, the Soviets or their clients have taken over Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, and South Yemen, and have solidified their grasp on a host of other nations in the developing world. The Soviet noose is now being drawn around southern Africa, the West's more abundant single source of critical raw materials.\n\nThe failure of the United States to respond to direct threats to its security has left American citizens vulnerable to terrorist assaults as well. American diplomatic personnel have been subject to seizure and assault by terrorists throughout the world without drawing a meaningful Administration response.\n\nNo failure of the Administration has been so catastrophic as its failure of leadership. Mired in incompetence, bereft of strategic vision and purpose, the President's failure to shoulder the burden of leadership in the Western alliance has placed America in danger without parallel since December 7, 1941. The United States cannot abdicate that role without inducing a diplomatic and eventually a military catastrophe.\n\nRepublicans realize that if the challenges of the 1980s are not met, we will continue to lose the respect of the world, our honor, and in the end, our freedom. Republicans pledge to meet these challenges with confidence and strength. We pledge to restore to the United States and its people a government with conviction in our cause, a government that will restore to our great nation its self-respect, its self-confidence, and its national pride.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Republicans returned to the White House, inheriting a war in Southeast Asia. Because of this war, they also inherited a Fiscal Year (FY) 1968 defense budget which, if calculated in constant 1981 dollars to account for inflation, had risen to over $194 billion from $148 billion in FY 1961, the last Eisenhower year. By the beginning of the second Nixon Administration, U.S. forces were totally disengaged from Southeast Asia. The FY 1974 defense budget had dropped back to $139 billion, and the country had reaped its desired \"peace dividend\" of an over $50 billion reduction in annual defense spending. During this period, between 1969 and 1973, the Democrats who controlled Congress, led by Senators Mondale and Muskie, cut almost $45 billion from Nixon defense requests. Until 1975, Congress continued to ignore long-range defense needs, and made severe cuts in Republican defense proposals. The Ford Administration, however, succeeded in reversing this trend. From a low point of $134 billion in FY 1975, the FY 1976 defense budget rose, in response to President Ford's request, to $139 billion; and in FY 1977 it rose again to $147 billion.\n\nDespite the growing sentiment for a stronger defense, candidate Carter ran on a promise of massive cuts in U.S. defense spending, one promise he has kept. In his first three years in the White House, Mr. Carter reduced defense spending by over $38 billion from President Ford's last Five Year Defense Plan. Now, in his last year in office, faced with the total collapse of his foreign policy, and with his policy advisers and their assumptions disgraced, he has finally proposed an increase beyond the rate of inflation in defense spending. But this growth for 1981 will be less than one percent.\n\nWe deplore Mr. Carter's personal attempts to rewrite history on defense budgets. His tough speeches before military audiences cannot hide his continuing opposition to Congressional defense increases. The four chiefs of the armed services have each characterized the Carter defense program as \"inadequate\" to meet the military threat posed to the United States. We associate ourselves with the characterization by Democratic Congressional leaders of the President's behavior on defense as \"hypocritical.\" We would go further; it is disgraceful.\n\nMr. Carter cut back, cancelled, or delayed every strategic initiative proposed by President Ford. He cancelled production of the Minuteman missile and the B-1 bomber. He delayed all cruise missiles, the MX missile, the Trident submarine and the Trident II missile. He did this while the Soviet Union deployed the Backfire bomber and designed two additional bombers equal in capability to the B-1, and while it deployed four new large ICBMs and developed four others.\n\nMr. Carter postponed production and deployment of enhanced radiation (neutron) warheads while the Soviet Union deployed the SS-20 mobile missile and the Backfire bomber against Western Europe. He cut President Ford's proposed shipbuilding plan in half. He vetoed a nuclear aircraft carrier. He did this while the Soviet Union pursued an aggressive shipbuilding program capable of giving them worldwide naval supremacy in the 1980s unless current trends are reversed immediately. Mr. Carter opposed efforts to correct the terribly inadequate pay rates for our military personnel and stood by as the alarming exodus of trained and skilled personnel from the services quickened. At the same time, the Soviet Union increased its military manpower to a level of 4.8 million, more than double that of the United States.\n\nRecovery from the Carter Administration's neglect will require effort, but Americans know that effort is the unavoidable precondition to peace and economic prosperity. The Soviet Union is now devoting over $50 billion more to defense annually than the United States, achieving military superiority as a result. We have depleted our capital and must now devote the resources essential to catching up. The Secretary of Defense has stated that even if we were to maintain a constant increase in our spending of five percent in real terms, it would require 40 years for us to catch up.\n\nRepublicans commit themselves to an immediate increase in defense spending to be applied judiciously to critically needed programs. We will build toward a sustained defense expenditure sufficient to close the gap with the Soviets, and ultimately reach the position of military superiority that the American people demand.\n\nMore is required than reversing our military decline alone. We have seen in recent years how an Administration, possessed of dwindling but still substantial strength, has stood paralyzed in the face of an inexorable march of Soviet or Soviet-sponsored aggression. To be effective in preserving our interests, we must pursue a comprehensive military strategy which guides both the design and employment of our forces. Such a strategy must proceed from a sober analysis of the diverse threats before us.\n\nRepublicans approve and endorse a national strategy of peace through strength as set forth in House Concurrent Resolution 306. We urge speedy approval of this legislation by both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate as a means of making clear to the world that the United States has not forgotten that the price of peace is eternal vigilance against tyranny. Therefore we commend to all Americans the text of House Concurrent Resolution 306 which reads as follows:\n\nThe foreign policy of the United States should reflect a national strategy of peace through strength. The general principles and goals of this strategy would be:\n\nTo inspire, focus, and unite the national will and determination to achieve peace and freedom;\n\nTo achieve overall military and technological superiority over the Soviet Union;\n\nTo create a strategic and civil defense which would protect the American people against nuclear war at least as well as the Soviet population is protected;\n\nTo accept no arms control agreement which in any way jeopardizes the security of the United States or its allies, or which locks the United States into a position of military inferiority;\n\nTo pursue positive non-military means to roll back the growth of communism;\n\nTo help our allies and other non-Communist countries defend themselves against Communist aggression; and\n\nTo maintain a strong economy and protect our overseas sources of energy and other vital raw materials.\n\nOur strategy must encompass the levels of force required to deter each level of foresee-able attack and to prevail in conflict in the event deterrence fails. The detailed analysis that must form the intellectual basis for elaboration of such a strategy will be the first priority of a Republican Administration. It must be based upon the following principles.\n\nNuclear weapons are the ultimate military guarantor of American security and that of our allies. Yet since 1977, the United States has moved from essential equivalence to inferiority in strategic nuclear forces with the Soviet Union. This decline has resulted from Mr. Carter's cancellation or delay of strategic initiatives like the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Trident II submarine missile programs and from his decisions to close the Minuteman production line and forego production of enhanced radiation weapons.\n\nAs the disparity between American and Soviet strategic nuclear forces grows over the next three years, most U.S. land-based missiles, heavy bombers, and submarines in port will become vulnerable to a Soviet first-strike. Such a situation invites diplomatic blackmail and coercion of the United States by the Soviet Union during the coming decade.\n\nAn administration that can defend its interest only by threatening the mass extermination of civilians, as Mr. Carter implied in 1979, dooms itself to strategic, and eventually geo-political, paralysis. Such a strategy is simply not credible and, therefore is ineffectual. Yet the declining survivability of the U.S. ICBM force in the early 1980s will make this condition unavoidable unless prompt measures are taken. Our objective must be to assure the survivability of U.S. forces possessing an unquestioned, prompt, hard-target counterforce capability sufficient to disarm Soviet military targets in a second strike. We reject the mutual-assured-destruction (MAD) strategy of the Carter Administration which limits the President during crises to a Hobson's choice between mass mutual suicide and surrender. We propose, instead, a credible strategy which will deter a Soviet attack by the clear capability of our forces to survive and ultimately to destroy Soviet military targets.\n\nIn order to counter the problem of ICBM vulnerability, we will propose a number of initiatives to provide the necessary survivability of the ICBM force in as timely and effective a manner as possible. In addition, we will proceed with:\n\nThe earliest possible deployment of the MX missile in a prudent survivable configuration;\n\nAccelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic penetrating bomber that will exploit the $5.5 billion already invested in the B-1, while employing the most advanced technology available;\n\nDeployment of an air defense system comprised of dedicated modern interceptor aircraft and early warning support systems;\n\nAcceleration of development and deployment of strategic cruise missiles deployed on aircraft, on land, and on ships and submarines\n\nModernization of the military command and control system to assure the responsiveness of U.S. strategic nuclear forces to presidential command in peace or war; and\n\nVigorous research and development of an effective anti-ballistic missile system, such as is already at hand in the Soviet Union, as well as more modern ABM technologies.\n\nFor more than 20 years, commencing in the mid-1950s, the United States has maintained tactical nuclear weapons in Europe for the purpose of assuring against deep penetrations into the West by the Soviet forces. Since 1977, however, the Administration has allowed our former superiority to erode to the point where we now face a more than three-to-one disadvantage.\n\nA Republican Administration will strive for early modernization of our theater nuclear forces so that a seamless web of deterrence can be maintained against all levels of attack, and our credibility with our European allies is restored. In consultation with them we will proceed with deployments in Europe of medium-range cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, enhanced radiation war-heads, and the modernization of nuclear artillery.\n\nThe greatest single result of our loss of nuclear parity has been the manifest increase in the willingness of the Soviet Union to take risks at the conventional level. Emboldened by the Carter Administration's failure to challenge their use of surrogate Cuban forces in Africa and the later Soviet presence in Angola, Ethiopia, and South Yemen, the Soviets, for the first time in postwar history, employed their own army units outside of the Soviet bloc in a brutal invasion of Afghanistan. The invasion presents chilling evidence of the mounting threat and raises fundamental questions with respect to United States strategy.\n\nWe believe it is not feasible at this time, and in the long term would be unworkable, to deploy massive U.S. ground forces to such areas as the Persian Gulf on a permanent basis as we do in Europe and elsewhere. A more effective strategy must be built on the dual pillars of maintaining a limited full-time presence in the area as a credible interdiction force, combined with the clear capability to reinforce this presence rapidly with the forces necessary to prevail in battle. In addition, the strategy must envision military action elsewhere at points of Soviet vulnerability—an expression of the classic doctrine of global maneuver.\n\nThe forces essential to the support of such a strategy must include a much-improved Navy, the force most suitable for maintaining U.S. presence in threatened areas and protecting sea lines of communication. In addition, we will require a substantial improvement in the air and sea mobility forces and improved access to regional installations. A Republican Administration will propose their substantial improvement, to include the establishment of a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean. We will also improve contingency planning for the use and expansion of our commercial maritime fleet and a new rational approach to emergency use of our civil aircraft fleet.\n\nThe budget cuts imposed by Mr. Carter on the Army and his restoration of the supremacy of systems analysis in the Pentagon have resulted in slowdowns, deferrals, and cost increases in nine vitally needed Army procurement programs in armor, firepower, air defense, and helicopters. These critical and long-delayed modernization programs must be restored to economical production rates and must be speeded into the field. Of equal importance is the need to bring our stocks of ammunition, spare parts, and supplies—now at woefully inadequate levels—to a standard that will enable us to sustain our forces in conflict.\n\nIn addition to the strategic programs needed for our Air Force, we pledge to restore tactical aircraft development and procurement to economical levels and to speed the achievement of 26 modernized wings of aircraft able to conduct missions at night, in all weather conditions, and against the most sophisticated adversary.\n\nWe pledge to increase substantially our intra- and inter-theater airlift capability and to increase our aerial tanker fleet through procurement and speedy modernization. Of all of the services, the Navy and Marines have suffered most from Mr. Carter's cuts. Their share of the defense budget has shrunk from 40 to 33 percent during the Carter Administration. Mr. Carter slashed President Ford's 157 ship, five-year construction program to 83. He has slowed the Trident submarine and requested only one attack submarine each year in spite of a Soviet three-to-one advantage. He vetoed the Fiscal Year 1979 Defense Authorization Bill because it included an aircraft carrier which a year later Congress forced him to accept. For the fourth straight year he has requested fewer than half of the 325 aircraft needed annually to stay even with peacetime attrition and modernization requirements. He has requested fewer than one-third of the amphibious ships needed just to keep the current level of capability for the Marines, and he has opposed Marine tactical aircraft and helicopter modernization.\n\nThe current Chief of Naval Operations has testified that, \"We are trying to meet a three ocean requirement with a one-and-a-half ocean Navy.\" Republicans pledge to reverse Mr. Carter's dismantling of U.S. naval and Marine forces. We will restore our fleet to 600 ships at a rate equal to or exceeding that planned by President Ford. We will build more aircraft carriers, submarines, and amphibious ships. We will restore naval and Marine aircraft procurement to economical rates enabling rapid modernization of the current forces, and expansion to meet the requirements of additional aircraft carriers.\n\nThe Republican Party is not prepared to accept a peacetime draft at this time. Under Mr. Carter, the all-volunteer force has not been given a fair chance to succeed. The unconscionable mismanagement and neglect of personnel policy by the Carter Administration has made a shambles of the all-volunteer force concept.\n\nPerhaps the most compelling vulnerability of our forces results from the dramatic exodus of the core of highly skilled men and women who form the backbone of our military strength. This loss is the direct result of neglect by the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nThe sustained malign neglect of our military manpower is nothing short of a national scandal. This Administration's active assault on military benefits and military retirement has been accompanied by an enforced pay-cap set at half the inflation rate. The average military family has lost between 14 percent and 25 percent in purchasing power over the past seven years. Officers and skilled enlisted personnel are leaving in droves, and 250,000 of our servicemen qualify for public assistance. Many of our career people earn less than the minimum wage. The services are currently short 70,000 senior enlisted personnel. This scandal is the direct result of Mr. Carter's willful downgrading of the military and inept mismanagement of personnel policy. As a top priority, the Republican Party pledges to end this national disgrace.\n\nWe pledge to restore a national attitude of pride and gratitude for the service of our men and women in the armed forces. We will act immediately to correct the great inequities in pay and benefits of career military personnel. Specifically, we support immediate action to:\n\nProvide for an increase in military pay targeted in particular toward the career grades now experiencing the greatest attrition;\n\nA Republican Administration will index military pay and allowances to protect military personnel from absorbing the burden of inflation. We pledge that the profession of arms will be restored to its rightful place as a prominent expression of patriotism in America.\n\nIn order to attract recruits of high ability, a Republican Administration will act to re-introduce G.I. Bill benefits for those completing two years active service. We will press for enactment of legislation denying federal funds to any educational institution that impedes access of military recruiters to their students. We regard as a serious loss the decision of many of our finest institutions of higher learning to discontinue their military officer training programs. The leadership of our armed forces must include the best trained minds in our nation. Republicans call upon our colleges and universities to shoulder their responsibilities in the defense of freedom. We will investigate legislative inducements toward this end. We will not consider a peacetime draft unless a well-managed, Congressionally-funded, full-scale effort to improve the all-volunteer force does not meet expectations.\n\nThe armed forces of the U.S. are today critically dependent upon our nation's Reserve components for both combat arms and combat support. The Army Reserve and National Guard provide one-third of the Army's combat divisions, 80 percent of its independent combat brigades, one-half of its artillery battalions, and one-third of its special forces groups. The Navy Reserve provides 90 percent of the Navy's ocean mine sweeping and two-thirds of its mobile construction battalions. The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard provide all of our strategic interceptors, 60 percent of our tactical airlift, and one-third of our tactical fighters. Reserve and National Guard units may be mobilized for even the smallest of conflicts and many such units today are expected to deploy immediately with the active duty units they support.\n\nToday, however, the reserves are ill-equipped, underpaid, and undermanned by several hundred thousand personnel. Proper equipment, realistic, challenging training, and greater full-time support must be made available. We must ensure that all Americans take note of the proud and vital role played by the Reserve and National Guard components of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nHistory records that readiness for war is the surest means of preventing it. Lack of preparedness is the most dangerously provocative course we can take. Yet funding requests for sufficient fuel, spare parts, ammunition, and supplies for U.S. war reserves have been cut each year for the past four years from the minimum quantities the armed services have stated they need. This has left the U.S. Armed Forces at their lowest state of preparedness since 1950, seriously compromising their ability to sustain a military conflict.\n\nCrippling shortages of spare parts, fuel, and ammunition compromise the ability of the armed forces to sustain a major military conflict. Some critical types of ammunition could not support combat operations for more than a week although we are committed to holding a 90-day inventory of major ammunition types. In addition, critical facilities such as airfields, ammunition depots, maintenance installations, and living quarters for our troops are in serious disrepair. The backlog of deferred maintenance and the underfunded purchase of vital combat consumables is so vast that years of effort will be required to rebuild U.S. forces to the required level of readiness.\n\nThe problem of maintaining the day-to-day combat readiness of the U.S. Armed Forces is compounded by the reduced ability of American industry to respond to wartime contingencies. Reduced acquisition of equipment for the modernization of the armed forces and the Carter Administration's failure to maintain combat readiness have eroded the incentive of American industry to maintain capacity adequate to potential defense requirements.\n\nRepublicans pledge to make the combat readiness of U.S. Armed Forces and the preparedness of the industrial base to a top priority.\n\nResearch and Development (R & D) provides a critical means by which our nation can cope with threats to our security. In the past, the United States' qualitative and technological superiority provided a foundation for our military superiority. Yet we are now on the verge of losing this advantage to the Soviet Union because of Mr. Carter's opposition to real increases in the R & D effort. Delays imposed on the R & D process now allow seven to 10 years or more to elapse between the time when a new weapon system is proposed and when it becomes available.\n\nThe Soviet Union now invests nearly twice as much in military research and development as does the United States. This disparity in effort threatens American technological superiority in the mid-1980s and could result in Soviet breakthroughs in advanced weapon systems.\n\nRepublicans pledge to revitalize America's military research and development efforts, from basic research through the deployment of weapons and support systems, to assure that our vital security needs will be met for the balance of the century. We will seek increased funding to guarantee American superiority in this critical area and to enable us to deal with possible breakthroughs in anti-missile defense, anti-satellite killers, directed energy systems, and the military and civilian exploitation of space.\n\nAmerica's technological advantage has always depended upon its interaction with our civilian science and technology sector. The economic policy of the Carter Administration has severely encumbered private research and development efforts, thereby depriving both our civil and military sectors of the fruits of scientific innovation.\n\nUnderfunding of beneficial government-sponsored research efforts in basic and applied scientific research has disrupted the benefits of years of effective effort. In particular, America's preeminence in the exploration of space is threatened by the failure of the Carter Administration to fund fully the Space Shuttle program (with its acknowledged benefits for both the civil and military applications) as well as advanced exploration programs. Republicans pledge to support a vigorous space research program.\n\nThe Republican Party pledges to reform the defense programming and budgeting management system established by the Carter Administration. The ill-informed, capricious intrusions of the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of Defense Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation have brought defense planning full circle to the worst faults of the McNamara years. Orderly planning by the military services has become impossible. Waste, inefficiency, and paralysis have been the hallmarks of Carter Administration defense planning and budgeting. This has resulted in huge cost overruns and in protracted delays in placing advanced systems in the field.\n\nAt a time of increasing danger, the U.S. intelligence community has lost much of its ability to supply the President, senior U.S. officials, and the Congress with accurate and timely analyses concerning fundamental threats to our nation's security. Morale and public confidence have been eroded and American citizens and friendly foreign intelligence services have become increasingly reluctant to cooperate with U.S. agencies. As a result of such problems, the U.S. Intelligence community has incorrectly assessed critical foreign developments, as in Iran, and has, above all, underestimated the size and purpose of the Soviet Union's military efforts.\n\nWe believe that a strong national consensus has emerged on the need to make our intelligence community a reliable and productive instrument of national policy once again. In pursuing its objectives, the Soviet Union and its surrogates operate by a far different set of rules than does the United States. We do not favor countering their efforts by mirroring their tactics. However, the United States requires a realistic assessment of the threats it faces, and it must have the best intelligence capability in the world. Republicans pledge this for the United States.\n\nA Republican Administration will seek to improve U.S. Intelligence capabilities for technical and clandestine collection, cogent analysis, coordinated counterintelligence, and covert action.\n\nWe will reestablish the President's Foreign intelligence Advisory Board, abolished by the Carter Administration, as a permanent nonpartisan body of distinguished Americans to perform a constant audit of national intelligence research and performance. We will propose methods of providing alternative intelligence estimates in order to improve the quality of the estimates by constructive competition.\n\nRepublicans will undertake an urgent effort to rebuild the intelligence agencies, and to give full support to their knowledgeable and dedicated staffs. We will propose legislation to enable intelligence officers and their agents to operate safely and efficiently abroad.\n\nWe will support legislation to invoke criminal sanctions against anyone who discloses the identities of U.S. intelligence officers abroad or who makes unauthorized disclosures of U.S. intelligence sources and methods.\n\nWe will support amendments to the Freedom of information Act and the Privacy Act to permit meaningful background checks on individuals being considered for sensitive positions and to reduce costly and capricious requests to the intelligence agencies.\n\nWe will provide our government with the capability to help influence international events vital to our national security interests, a capability which only the United States among the major powers has denied itself.\n\nA Republican Administration will seek adequate safeguards to ensure that past abuses will not recur, but we will seek the repeal of ill-considered restrictions sponsored by Democrats, which have debilitated U.S. intelligence capabilities while easing the intelligence collection and subversion efforts of our adversaries.\n\nIn the decade of the seventies, all civilized nations were shaken by a wave of widespread, international terrorist attacks. Time and again, nations and individuals have been subjected to extortion and murder at the hands of extremists who reject the rule of law, civil order, and the sanctity of individual human rights. Terrorism has been elevated to the level of overt national policy as authorities in Iran, encouraged by the Soviet Union, have held 53 Americans captive for more than eight months. Comprehensive support of international terrorist organizations has been a central, though generally covert, element of Soviet foreign policy.\n\nRepublicans believe that this tragic history contains lessons that must serve as the basis for a determined international effort to end this era of terrorism. We believe that certain principles have emerged from incidents in which states have defeated terrorist attacks, and we believe the United States should take the lead in a multilateral drive to eliminate the terrorist threat. A first requirement is the establishment of a military capability to deal promptly and effectively with any terrorist acts. We cannot afford, as in the abortive Iranian rescue mission, to allow months to pass while we prepare responses.\n\nThe United States must provide the leadership to forge an international consensus that firmness and refusal to concede are ultimately the only effective deterrents to terrorism. The United States should take the lead in combating international terrorism. We must recognize and be prepared to deal with the reality of expanded Soviet sponsorship of international terrorist movements. Development of an effective antiterrorist military capability and establishment of a Congressional and Executive capability to oversee our internal security efforts will no longer be neglected.\n\nThe role of arms control in defense policy\n\nThe Republican approach to arms control has been markedly different from that of the Democratic Party. It has been based on three fundamental premises:\n\nFirst, before arms control negotiations may be undertaken, the security of the United States must be assured by the funding and deployment of strong military forces sufficient to deter conflict at any level or to prevail in battle should aggression occur;\n\nSecond, negotiations must be conducted on the basis of strict reciprocity of benefits—unilateral restraint by the U.S. has failed to bring reductions by the Soviet Union; and\n\nThird, arms control negotiations, once entered, represent an important political and military undertaking that cannot be divorced from the broader political and military behavior of the parties.\n\nA Republican Administration will pursue arms control solely on the principles outlined above.\n\nDuring the past three and one-half years, the Carter Administration's policy has been diametrically opposed to these principles. First, by its willful cancellation or delay of essential strategic military programs such as the B-1, the MX missile, and the Trident submarine, it has seriously damaged the credibility and effectiveness of the U.S. deterrent force. Second, by not insisting upon corresponding concessions from the Soviet Union it has, in effect, practiced unilateral disarmament and removed any incentives for the Soviets to negotiate for what they could obviously achieve by waiting. The Republican Party rejects the fundamentally flawed SALT II treaty negotiated by the Carter Administration.\n\nThe Republican Party deplores the attempts of the Carter Administration to cover up Soviet non-compliance with arms control agreements including the now overwhelming evidence of blatant Soviet violation of the Biological Warfare Convention by secret production of biological agents at Sverdlovsk.\n\nIn our platform four years ago, we stated that, \"The growth of civilian nuclear technology and the rising demand for nuclear power as an alternative to increasingly costly fossil fuel resources, combine to require our recognition of the potential dangers associated with such development.\" We called for the formation of new multilateral arrangements to control the export of sensitive nuclear technologies. Unfortunately, the Carter Administration has failed to provide the leadership and creative diplomacy essential to forging effective international safeguards and cooperation in this vital area. In particular we oppose and deplore the pending delivery to India of nuclear material which can be directed to the manufacture of weapons.\n\nThe Republican Party reaffirms its commitment to the early establishment of effective multilateral arrangements for the safe management and monitoring of all transfers and uses of nuclear materials in the international market.\n\nThe premier challenge facing the United States, its allies, and the entire globe is to check the Soviet Union's global ambitions. This challenge must be met, for the present danger is greater than ever before in the 200-year history of the United States. The Soviet Union is still accelerating its drive for military superiority and is intensifying its military pressure and its ideological combat against the industrial democracies and the vulnerable developing nations of the world.\n\nRepublicans believe that the United States can only negotiate with the Soviet Union from a position of unquestioned principle and unquestioned strength. Unlike Mr. Carter, we see nothing \"inordinate\" in our nation's historic judgment about the goals, tactics, and dangers of Soviet communism. Unlike the Carter Administration, we are not surprised by the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan or by other Soviet violations of major international agreements regulating international behavior, human rights, and the use of military force. And, unlike the Carter Administration, we will not base our policies toward the Soviet Union on naive expectations, unilateral concessions, futile rhetoric, and insignificant maneuvers.\n\nAs the Soviet Union continues in its expansionist course, the potential for dangerous confrontations has increased. Republicans will strive to resolve critical issues through peaceful negotiations, but we recognize that negotiations conducted from a position of military weakness can result only in further damage to American interests.\n\nA Republican Administration will continue to seek to negotiate arms reductions in Soviet strategic weapons, in Soviet bloc force levels in Central Europe, and in other areas that may be amenable to reductions or limitations. We will pursue hard bargaining for equitable, verifiable, and enforceable agreements. We will accept no agreement for the sake of having an agreement, and will accept no agreements that do not fundamentally enhance our national security.\n\nRepublicans oppose the transfer of high technology to the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites, such as has been done in the past, permitting development of sophisticated military hardware which threatens the United States and our allies. The Carter Administration has encouraged the most extensive raid on American technology by the Soviet bloc since World War II. The Soviet Union has gained invaluable scientific expertise in electronics, computer sciences, manufacturing techniques, mining, transportation, aviation, agriculture, and a host of other disciplines. This has contributed to the ability of the Soviet Union to divert investment and manpower from their civilian economy to their armed forces. The fruits of Soviet access to American technology will improve the performance of the Soviet military establishment for years to come. The matter is compounded by the practice of subsidized financing of much of the Soviet bloc's acquisition of American technology through U.S. financial institutions.\n\nRepublicans pledge to stop the flow of technology to the Soviet Union that could contribute, directly or indirectly, to the growth of their military power. This objective will be pursued by a Republican Administration with our allies and other friendly nations as well. We will ensure that the Soviet Union fully understands that it will be expected to fulfill all of the commercial and diplomatic obligations it has undertaken in its international agreements.\n\nWe oppose Mr. Carter's singling out the American farmer to bear the brunt of his failed foreign policy by imposition of a partial and incompetently managed grain embargo. Because of his failure to obtain cooperation from other grain exporting countries, the embargo has been a travesty and a substitute for policy. We call for the immediate lifting of this embargo.\n\nWe reaffirm our commitment to press the Soviet Union to implement the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights and the Helsinki Agreements which guarantee rights such as the free interchange of information and the right to emigrate. A Republican Administration will press the Soviet Union to end its harassment and imprisonment of those who speak in opposition to official policy, who seek to worship according to their religious beliefs, or who represent diverse ethnic minorities and nationalities.\n\nRepublicans deplore growing anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union and the mistreatment of \"refuseniks\" by Soviet authorities. The decline in exit visas to Soviet Jews and others seeking religious freedom and the promulgation of ever more rigorous conditions inhibiting their emigration are a fundamental affront to human rights and the U.N. Charter. Republicans will make the subject of emigration from the Soviet Union a central issue in Soviet-American relations. Human rights in the Soviet Union will not be ignored as it has been during the Carter Administration. As a party to the Helsinki Conference Final Act, a Republican Administration will insist on full Soviet compliance with the humanitarian provisions of the agreement.\n\nRepublicans pledge our continued support for the people of Cuba and the captive nations of Central and Eastern Europe in their hope to achieve self-determination. We stand firmly for the independence of Yugoslavia. We support self-determination and genuine independence for new captive nations of Africa and Latin America threatened by the growing domination of Soviet power.\n\nA Republican Administration will end the sustained Carter policy of misleading the American people about Soviet policies and behavior. We will spare no efforts to publicize to the world the fundamental differences in the two systems and will strengthen such means as the international Communications Agency, the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio Liberty actively to articulate U.S. values and policies, and to highlight the weaknesses of totalitarianism.\n\nWe pledge to end the Carter cover-up of Soviet violations of SALT I and II, to end the cover-up of Soviet violation of the Biological Warfare Convention, and to end the cover-up of Soviet use of gas and chemical weapons in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nSince its inception three decades ago, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has expressed the collective will of free nations to resist totalitarian aggression. As a cornerstone of the Western Alliance, NATO has stood on the firm foundations of American strategic strength, joint Allied defense efforts, and cooperative diplomacy based on shared interest and close consultations. The Republican Party recognizes that NATO serves the vital interest of the entire Western world and over the years we have continued to give the Alliance our undiminished and bipartisan support.\n\nRepublicans deplore the current drifts toward neutralism in Western Europe. We recognize that NATO and our Western Allies today face the greatest array of threats in their history, both from within and from without. Through its inept policies, the Carter Administration has substantially contributed to the evident erosion of Alliance security and confidence in the U.S. A Republican Administration, as one of its highest priorities and in close concert with our NATO partners, will therefore ensure that the United States leads a concerted effort to rebuild a strong, confident Alliance fully prepared to meet the threats and the challenges of the 1980s.\n\nThe chief external threat to NATO is that of developing Soviet military superiority. In a period of supposed \"detente,\" the NATO nations have too often cut back or delayed essential defense programs and too often placed excessive hopes in arms control negotiations, while the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact has been transformed into the world's most powerful offensive military force.\n\nThree-and-a-half years of Carter Administration policies have resulted in an increased threat to vital Alliance security interests. Mr. Carter's unilateral cancellations, reductions, and long delays in the B-1, Trident, MX, cruise-missile, and ship-building programs have increased the vulnerability of the U.S. strategic triad and have contributed to a developing strategic imbalance which undermines the foundation of Western deterrent and defense capabilities. His fundamentally flawed SALT II treaty would have codified Western inferiority. His reversals on the development and deployment of the \"enhanced radiation\" or neutron weapon, his treatment of future theater nuclear force modernization negotiations, and his manner of dealing with terrorist actions directed against Americans abroad, further undermined Alliance solidarity and security.\n\nThese Carter Administration inconsistencies have caused disunity in the Alliance. We have seen confusion in the fields of trade, fiscal, and energy policies. The lack of close coordination regarding Iran, the Middle East, Afghanistan, the Olympic boycott, nuclear proliferation, East-West trade, human rights, North-South issues, and a host of other international issues affecting Alliance interests, has reinforced Allied concerns. Republicans are concerned that these Carter Administration actions have increased Allied temptation to conduct independent diplomacy and to seek accommodation in the face of pressure from the Soviet Union. In this regard, we categorically reject unilateral moratoria on the deployment by the U.S. and NATO of theater nuclear weapons. Further, Republicans will oppose arms control agreements that interfere with the transfer of military technology to our allies.\n\nIn pledging renewed United States leadership, cooperation, and consultation, Republicans assert their expectation that each of the allies will bear a fair share of the common defense effort and that they will work closely together in support of common Alliance goals. Defense budgets, weapons acquisition, force readiness, and diplomatic coordination need to be substantially increased and improved. Within Europe as well as in areas beyond Europe which affect the shared vital interests of the Alliance, we will seek to increase our cooperative efforts, including increased planning for joint actions to meet common threats.\n\nThe Republican Party recognizes the vital importance of countries defending the regions of NATO. We will search for an early resolution of problems that currently inhibit the effective participation of all the nations of NATO's southern region and we call for the integration of Spain into the North Atlantic Alliance.\n\nIn the past three years, the nations of the Middle East and Persian Gulf have suffered an unprecedented level of political, economic, and military turmoil. The Soviet Union has been prompt in turning these sources of instability to its advantage and is now in an excellent position to exploit the chaos in Iran and to foment similar upheavals in other countries in the region. Today, the countries of the Middle East and Persian Gulf are encircled as never before by Soviet advisers and troops based in the Horn of Africa, South Yemen, and Afghanistan. Moreover, the Soviets have close political and military ties with other states in the region.\n\nThe Soviet goal is clear—to use subversion and the threat of military intervention to establish a controlling influence over the region's resource-rich states, and thereby to gain decisive political and economic leverage over Western and Third World nations vulnerable to economic coercion. The first signs of Soviet success in this undertaking are already evidenced in the recent proposal by European countries to associate the Palestinian Liberation Organization in the West Bank autonomy talks.\n\nRepublicans believe that the restoration of order and stability to the region must be premised upon an understanding of the interrelationship between Soviet and radical Palestinian goals, the fundamental requirements of stable economic development and marketing of the area's resources, and the growing ferment among Islamic radical groups. Republicans believe that a wise and credible United States policy must make clear that our foremost concern is for the long-term peaceful development of all states in the region, not purely a self-serving exploitation of its resources. Our goal is to bring a just and lasting peace to the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nWith respect to an ultimate peace settlement, Republicans reject any call for involvement of the PLO as not in keeping with the long-term interests of either Israel or the Palestinian Arabs. The imputation of legitimacy to organizations not yet willing to acknowledge the fundamental right to existence of the State of Israel is wrong. Repeated indications, even when subsequently denied, of the Carter Administration's involvement with the PLO has done serious harm to the credibility of U.S. policy in the Middle East and has encouraged the PLO's position of intransigence. We believe the establishment of a Palestinian State on the West Bank would be destabilizing and harmful to the peace process.\n\nOur long- and short-term policies for the area must be developed in consultation with our NATO allies, Israel, Egypt, and other friends in the area, and we will spare no effort in seeking their consultation throughout the policy process, not merely demand their acquiescence to our plans.\n\nThe sovereignty, security, and integrity of the State of Israel is a moral imperative and serves the strategic interests of the United States. Republicans reaffirm our fundamental and enduring commitment to this principle. We will continue to honor our nation's commitment through political, economic, diplomatic, and military aid. We fully recognize the strategic importance of Israel and the deterrent role of its armed forces in the Middle East and East-West military equations.\n\nRepublicans recognize that a just and durable peace for all nations of the region is the best guarantee of continued stability and is vital to deterring further Soviet inroads. Peace between Israel and its neighbors requires direct negotiations among the states involved. Accordingly, a Republican Administration will encourage the peace process now in progress between Egypt and Israel, will seek to broaden it, and will welcome those Arab nations willing to live in peace with Israel. We are encouraged by the support given to the Middle East peace process by Sudan and Groan and the progress brought about by the strong and effective leadership of their governments.\n\nWe applaud the vision and courage of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and we pledge to build our relationship with Egypt in cultural affairs, economic development, and military cooperation.\n\nRepublicans recognize that the Carter Administration's vacillations have left friend and foe alike unsure as to United States' policies. While reemphasizing our commitment to Israel, a Republican Administration will pursue close ties and friendship with moderate Arab states. We will initiate the economic and military framework for assuring long-term stability in the internal development of regional states and an orderly marketplace for the area's resources. We will make clear that any reimposition of an oil embargo would be viewed as a hostile act. We will oppose discriminatory practices, including boycotts, and we will discourage arms sales which contribute to regional instability.\n\nRepublicans believe that Jerusalem should remain an undivided city with continued free and unimpeded access to all holy places by people of all faiths.\n\nLatin America is an area of primary interest for the United States. Yet, the Carter Administration's policies have encouraged a precipitous decline in United States relations with virtually every country in the region. The nations of South and Central America have been battered by the Carter Administration's economic and diplomatic sanctions linked to its undifferentiated charges of human rights violations.\n\nIn the Caribbean and Central America, the Carter Administration stands by while Castro's totalitarian Cuba, financed, directed, and supplied by the Soviet Union, aggressively trains, arms, and supports forces of warfare and revolution throughout the Western hemisphere. Yet the Carter Administration has steadily denied these threats and in many cases has actively worked to undermine governments and parties opposed to the expansion of Soviet power. This must end.\n\nWe deplore the Marxist Sandinista take-over of Nicaragua and the Marxist attempts to destabilize El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. We do not support United States assistance to any Marxist government in this hemisphere and we oppose the Carter Administration aid program for the government of Nicaragua. However, we will support the efforts of the Nicaraguan people to establish a free and independent government.\n\nRepublicans deplore the dangerous and incomprehensible Carter Administration policies toward Cuba. The Administration has done nothing about the Soviet combat brigade stationed there, or about the transfer of new Soviet offensive weapons to Cuba in the form of modern MIG aircraft and submarines. It has done nothing about the Soviet pilots flying air defense missions in Cuba or about the extensive improvements to Soviet military bases, particularly the submarine facilities in Cienfuegos, and the expanded Soviet intelligence facilities near Havana.\n\nRepublicans recognize the importance of our relations within this hemisphere and pledge a strong new United States policy in the Americas. We will stand firm with countries seeking to develop their societies while combating the subversion and violence exported by Cuba and Moscow. We will return to the fundamental principle of treating a friend as a friend and self-proclaimed enemies as enemies, without apology. We will make it clear to the Soviet Union and Cuba that their subversion and their build-up of offensive military forces is unacceptable.\n\nRepublicans recognize the special importance of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands in the defense of freedom in the Caribbean. We believe that Puerto Rico's admission to the Union would demonstrate our common purpose in the face of growing Soviet and Cuban pressure in that area.\n\nRepublicans recognize the fundamental importance of Mexico and restoration of good working relations with that country will be of highest priority. A new Republican Administration will immediately begin high-level, comprehensive negotiations, seeking solutions to common problems on the basis of mutual interest and recognizing that each country has unique contributions to make in resolving practical problems.\n\nRepublicans pledge to reestablish close and cooperative relations with the nations of Central and South America and repair the diplomatic damage done by the Carter Administration. We pledge understanding and assistance in the efforts of these nations, and their neighbors, to deal seriously with serious domestic problems.\n\nWe pledge to ensure that the Panama Canal remains open, secure, and free of hostile control.\n\nThe reservations and understandings to the Panama Canal treaties, including those assuring the United States of primary responsibility of protecting and defending the Canal, are an integral part of those treaties and we will hold Panama to strict interpretation of the language of the treaties, clearly established by the legislative history of Senate adoption of amendments, reservations, and understandings at the time of Senate approval of the treaties.\n\nWe would remind the American taxpayers that President Carter gave repeated assurances that the Panama Canal treaties would not cost the American taxpayers \"one thin dime,\" and we emphasize the fact that implementing the Panama Canal treaties will cost them $4.2 billion.\n\nWe will work closely with Canada as our most important trading partner in the hemisphere. We will foster the deep affinity that exists between our two nations and our policies will be based on mutual understanding and complete equality.\n\nWe will seek a North America Accord designed to foster close cooperation and mutual benefit between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\nA new Republican Administration will, in close cooperation with its neighbors, seek to work together to build prosperity and to strengthen common efforts to combat externally produced revolution and violence.\n\nThe United States is and must remain a Pacific power. It is our vital interest to maintain U.S. guaranteed stability in the area. Republicans recognize the dangerous shifts in power that have accelerated under the current Democratic Administration. The balance on the Korean peninsula has shifted dangerously toward the North. Soviet naval forces in Asia and the Pacific have steadily increased and are now at least equal to U.S. naval forces there. Unilateral cancellation by the United States of the mutual defense pact with Taiwan and the abrupt announcement of withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Korea, have led countries throughout the region to question the value of alliance with the United States.\n\nA new Republican Administration will restore a strong American role in Asia and the Pacific. We will make it clear that any military action which threatens the independence of America's allies and friends will bring a response sufficient to make its cost prohibitive to potential adversaries.\n\nJapan will continue to be a pillar of American policy in Asia. Republicans recognize the mutual interests and special relationships that exist between the two countries in their commitment to democracy and in trade, defense, and cultural matters. A new Republican Administration will work closely with the Japans government to resolve outstanding trade and energy problems on an equitable basis. We strongly support a substantially increased Japanese national defense effort and reaffirm that our long-range objectives of military security and a balancing of the expanded Soviet military presence in the region are of mutual interest.\n\nRepublicans recognize the unique danger presented to our ally, South Korea. We will encourage continued efforts to expand political participation and individual liberties within the country, but will recognize the special problems brought on by subversion and potential aggression from the North. We will maintain American ground and air forces in South Korea, and will not reduce our presence further. Our treaty commitments to South Korea will be restated in unequivocal terms and we will reestablish the process of close consultations between our governments.\n\nWe reaffirm our special and historic relationships with the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, and Australia. Republicans will recognize the long friendship with these countries and will cultivate and strengthen our diplomatic and trade relationships.\n\nWe deplore the brutal acts of Communist Vietnam against the people of Cambodia and Laos. We recognize that the suffering of refugees from these ravaged countries represents a major moral challenge to the world and one of the great human tragedies of modern times. A Republican Administration will work actively to bring relief to these suffering people, especially those who have sought refuge in Thailand. We value the special contribution the people of Thailand have made to the refugees by opening their borders and saving hundreds of thousands of them from death, and we pledge to provide full economic aid and military material to assist Thailand in repelling Vietnamese aggression.\n\nWe believe that no expanded relations with Communist Vietnam should be pursued while it continues its course of brutal expansionism and genocide. We pledge that a Republican Administration will press for full accounting of Americans still listed as missing in action.\n\nRecognizing the growing importance of the People's Republic of China in world affairs, Republicans—who took the historic initiative in opening the lines of communication with that nation—will continue the process of building a working relationship with the PRC. Growing contacts between the United States and the People's Republic of China reflect the interests of both nations, as well as some common perceptions of recent changes in the global military balance. We will not ignore the profound differences in our respective philosophies, governmental institutions, policies, and concepts of individual liberty.\n\nWe will strive for the creation of conditions that will foster the peaceful elaboration of our relationship with the People's Republic of China. We will exercise due caution and prudence with respect to our own vital interests, especially in the field of expanding trade, including the transfer of sophisticated technology with potential offensive military applications. The relationship between the two countries must be based on mutual respect and reciprocity, with due regard for the need to maintain peace and stability in Asia.\n\nAt the same time, we deplore the Carter Administration's treatment of Taiwan, our long-time ally and friend. We pledge that our concern for the safety and security of the 17 million people of Taiwan will be constant. We would regard any attempt to alter Taiwan's status by force as a threat to peace in the region. We declare that the Republican Administration, in strengthening relations with Taiwan, will create conditions leading to the expansion of trade, and will give priority consideration to Taiwan's defense requirements.\n\nThe Republican Party supports the principle and process of self-determination in Africa. We reaffirm our commitment to this principle and pledge our strong opposition to the effort of the Soviet Union and its militant allies to subvert this process. Soviet bases, tens of thousands of Cuban troops, and Soviet-bloc subversion are unacceptable.\n\nWe recognize that much is at stake in Africa and that the United States and the industrial West have vital interests there—economically, strategically, and politically. Working closely with our allies, a Republican Administration will seek to assist the countries of Africa with our presence, our markets, our know-how, and our investment. We will work to create a climate of economic and political development and confidence. We will encourage and assist business to play a major role in support of regional industrial development programs, mineral complexes, and agricultural self-sufficiency.\n\nRepublicans believe that African nations, if given a choice, will reject the Marxist, totalitarian model being forcibly imposed by the Soviet Union and its surrogates including Cuban and Nicaraguan troops as well as East German secret police. We believe that they know the Communist powers have relatively little to offer them and that, for the most part, the African peoples are convinced that the West is central to world stability and economic growth on which their own fortunes ultimately depend.\n\nA Republican Administration will adhere to policies that reflect the complex origins of African conflicts, demonstrate that we know what U.S. interests are, and back those interests in meaningful ways. We will recognize the important role of economic and military assistance programs and will devote major resources to assisting African development and stability when such aid is given on a bilateral basis and contributes directly to American interests on the continent.\n\nIn Southern Africa, American policies must be guided by commonsense and by our own humanitarian principles. Republicans believe that our history has meaning for Africa in demonstrating that a multiracial society with guarantees of individual rights is possible and can work. We must remain open and helpful to all parties, whether in the new Zimbabwe, in Namibia, or in the Republic of South Africa. A Republican Administration will not endorse situations or constitutions, in whatever society, which are racist in purpose or in effect. It will not expect miracles, but will press for genuine progress in achieving goals consistent with American ideals.\n\nThe United States has included foreign assistance and regional security as a major element of its foreign policy for four decades. Properly administered and focused, foreign assistance can be an effective means of promoting United States foreign policy objectives, and serve to enhance American security by assisting friendly nations to become stronger and more capable of defending themselves and their regions against foreign subversion and attack.\n\nThe threat posed to individual Third World nations is beyond the means of any one of them to counter alone. A Republican Administration will seek to strengthen and assist regional security arrangements among nations prepared to assume the burden of their defense.\n\nNo longer should American foreign assistance programs seek to force acceptance of American governmental forms. The principal consideration should be whether or not extending assistance to a nation or group of nations will advance America's interests and objectives. The single-minded attempt to force acceptance of U.S. values and standards of democracy has undermined several friendly nations, and has made possible the advance of Soviet interests in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and in the Western Hemisphere in the past four years.\n\nAmerican foreign economic assistance is not a charitable venture; charity is most effectively carried out by private entities. Only by private economic development by the people of the nations involved has poverty ever been overcome. U.S. foreign economic assistance should have a catalytic effect on indigenous economic development, and should only be extended when it is consistent with America's foreign policy interest. America's foreign assistance programs should be a vehicle for exporting the American idea.\n\nA Republican Administration will emphasize bilateral assistance programs whenever possible. Bilateral programs provide the best assurance that aid programs will be fully accountable to the American taxpayer, and wholly consistent with our foreign policy interests.\n\nThe effort of the Carter Administration to diminish the role of American military assistance and foreign military sales in our foreign policy has had several negative effects:\n\nIt has resulted in the export of many thousands of American jobs as the Soviet Union, Britain, and France have taken sales prohibited to American manufacturers;\n\nIt has reduced the ability of friendly nations to defend their independence against Soviet-sponsored subversion, resulting in several cases in abject takeovers by overtly pro-Soviet regimes; and\n\nIt has weakened the fabric of the U.S. alliance structure by making the U.S. appear to be an unreliable ally, a trend which can only lead to the undesirable attempt by nations fearful of their security to seek to acquire their own nuclear weapons.\n\nDecisions to provide military assistance should be made on the basis of U.S. foreign policy objectives. Such assistance to any nation need not imply complete approval of a regime's domestic policy. Republicans pledge to strengthen America's presence abroad by well-constructed programs of military assistance to promote national and regional security.\n\nThe manipulation of foreign arms sales has been one of the most seriously abused policy initiatives of the Carter Administration. The establishment of arbitrary ceilings on foreign sales, and the complex procedural and policy guidelines governing such sales have impeded the support of U.S. foreign policy objectives abroad. Friendly and allied nations alike have had to turn elsewhere for arms. This has stimulated the growth of a new arms industry in developing nations. Republicans pledge to reform and rebuild U.S. military assistance and foreign arms sales policies so that they will serve American interests in promoting regional security arrangements and the individual defense needs of friendly nations.\n\nThe American economy has an abundance of human and material resources, but nevertheless, it is part of a larger global economy. Our domestic prosperity and international competitiveness depend upon our participation in the international economy. Moreover, our security interests are in part determined by international economic factors. Yet the Carter Administration has largely ignored the role of international economics in relations between the United States and friendly nations throughout the world. The Administration has conducted its international economic policy at cross-purposes with other dimensions of its foreign policy, resulting in strains within the Western alliance and a general decline in the domestic prosperity. Under a Republican Administration, our international economic policy will be harmonized with our foreign and defense policies to leave no doubt as to the strategy and purpose of American policy.\n\nThe economic policy of the Carter Administration has led to the most serious decline in the value of the dollar in history. The ability of Americans to purchase goods and services or to invest abroad has been diminished by Carter Administration policies devaluing the dollar. Republicans will conduct international economic policy in a manner that will stabilize the value of the dollar at home and abroad.\n\nThe Republican Party believes the United States must adopt an aggressive export policy. For too long, our trade policy has been geared toward helping our foreign trading partners. Now, we have to put the United States back on the world export map. We helped pull other countries out of the post-World War II economic chaos: it is time to remedy our own crisis. Trade, especially exporting, must be high on our list of national priorities. The Republicans will put it there and will promote trade to ensure the long-term health of the U.S. economy.\n\nExports can play a key role in strengthening the U.S. economy, creating jobs and improving our standard of living. A $15 billion increase in exports can increase employment by 1,000,000, the Gross National Product by $37 billion per year, and private investment by $4 billion per year. Nevertheless, the Carter Administration has placed exporting at the bottom of its priority list. The present Administration's trade policies lack coordination, cohesiveness, and true commitment to improving our export performance. Rather than helping to create strong exporters in the United States and thereby create more Jobs for Americans, the Carter Administration's trade policies have discouraged traders. At best, the Administration has adopted a passive approach to trade, merely reacting to changing world economies, rather than actively seeking to promote a global structure that best addresses America's needs. As a result, we lag seriously behind our foreign competitors in trade performance and economic strength. Export promotion will be a central objective of international economic policy in a Republican Administration.\n\nA Republican Administration will emphasize a policy of free trade, but will expect our trading partners to do so as well. The failure of the Carter Administration energetically to pursue negotiations designed to improve the access of American exports to foreign markets has contributed, in part, to protectionist sentiment.\n\nDomestic problems—over-burdensome government regulations, excessive taxation, inflationary monetary policy, and an unstable economy—have contributed to the protectionist sentiments as well. We realize that protectionist legislation has engendered retaliation by America's trading partners in the past resulting in \"beggar thy neighbor\" policies that had such disastrous consequences in the 1930s.\n\nRepublicans are committed to protect American Jobs and American workers first and foremost. The Republican Party believes in free trade, and we will insist that our trade policy be based on the principles of reciprocity and equity. We oppose subsidies, tariff and non-tariff barriers that unfairly restrict access of American products to foreign markets. We will not stand idly by as the jobs of millions of Americans in domestic industries, such as automobiles, textiles, steel, and electronics are jeopardized and lost. We pledge to strengthen trade agreements and to change the Carter economic policies that have undermined the capability of American agriculture and industry to compete abroad.\n\nRepublicans believe that this nation's international trade balance can be improved through the elimination of disincentives for exporters. Statutory and regulatory requirements that inhibit exports should be reviewed and, where practical, eliminated. We further recognize that government can play a role in promoting international trade by establishing incentives for exports, especially those for small and medium size business. We pledge also to work with our trading partners to eliminate subsidies to exports and dumping.\n\nThe ability of the United States to compete in foreign markets is hampered by the excessive taxation of Americans working abroad who contribute to our domestic well-being by promoting international trade. Increased exports to our trading partners result in jobs and a rising standard of living at home. Carter Administration policy has the effect of discouraging the presence of American businessmen abroad due to the unfairly high level of taxation levied against them. A Republican Administration will support legislation designed to eliminate this inequity so that American citizens can fully participate in international commerce without fear of discriminatory taxation.\n\nOur nation must have a strong, competitive, and efficient merchant marine to meet the needs of our international commerce and our national security. We must arrest the significant decline of recent years in the ability of American-flag shipping to compete effectively for the carriage of world commerce. A Republican Administration will revitalize our merchant marine through a responsive and sustained policy. We will encourage the development and maintenance of an American-flag ocean transportation system, staffed with trained American personnel and capable of carrying a substantial portion of our international trade in a competitive and efficient manner. We will promote the development and support of a domestic shipbuilding and ship-repair mobilization base adequate to both the commercial and the national security requirements of the United States.\n\nThe security of energy and raw materials access\n\nThe security of America's foreign sources of energy and raw material supply can no longer be ignored. The United States imports 50 percent of it domestic petroleum requirements, and depends upon foreign sources for 22 of the 74 non-fuel raw materials essential to a modern industrial economy, Nine of the most critical raw materials are almost entirely (i.e., more than 90 percent) located abroad. In contrast, the Soviet Union imports only two critical minerals at a level in excess of 50 percent of domestic consumption.\n\nReducing reliance on uncertain foreign sources and assuring access to foreign energy and raw materials require the harmonization of economic policy with our defense and foreign policy. Domestic economic and regulatory policy must be adjusted to remove impediments to greater development of our own energy and raw materials resources. Democratic policies for federal land management, taxation, monetary policy, and economic regulation have served to increase America's dependence on foreign sources of energy and raw materials. Republicans pledge to work to eliminate domestic disincentives to the exploitation of these resources.\n\nMultilateral negotiations have thus far insufficiently focused attention on U.S. long-term security requirements. A pertinent example of this phenomenon is the Law of the Sea Conference, where negotiations have served to inhibit U.S. exploration of the sea-bed for its abundant mineral resources. Too much concern has been lavished on nations unable to carry out sea-bed mining, with insufficient attention paid to gaining early American access to it. A Republican Administration will conduct multilateral negotiations in a manner that reflects America's abilities and long-term interest in access to raw material and energy resources.\n\nResource access will assume an important place in defense and economic planning under a Republican Administration. Since America's allies are, in most cases, more dependent than the U.S. on foreign sources of energy and raw materials, they too have a vital interest in the defense of their access to these critical resources. Republicans pledge to promote allied defense cooperation to assure protection from military threats to overseas resources.Brow 1980: This is a carousel with rotating slides.

Although the Court did not grant summary judgment of no literal infringement, Butamax acknowledged that it could not prove literal infringement under the court's claim construction and agreed to stipulate to a judgment of no literal infringement.\n\nIn January 2011, Butamax filed a patent infringement suit against Gevo asserting two patents relating to the production of isobutanol, a four-carbon alcohol, in microorganisms. Gevo produces its isobutanol using proprietary recombinant yeast that is genetically engineered to produce it at a high yield. In June 2012, the court denied Butamax's request for a preliminary injunction against Gevo, a decision that was upheld by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in December 2012. A trial date was set for early April 2013.\n\n\"This judgment marks yet another great step forward for Gevo,\" said Jim Brogan, partner and chair of the intellectual property group.\"The ruling enables this highly innovative company to continue to focus on its growth and the development of innovative biofuels products.\"\n\nA separate patent re-examination team has obtained rejections of all challenged claims of the two asserted Butamax patents from the US Patent and Trademark Office.Rodina on Steam: What the developers have to say:\n\n“I consider Rodina to be in \"ongoing development\". This means that I will keep adding new features and game content, even after the game comes out of Early Access.\n\n \n\n Many Early Access games have a set feature list and definite end-point. This is not the case for Rodina, which is more reminiscent of games like Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress, where you could imagine features being added forever, and designations like \"Released\" and \"Beta\" are somewhat arbitrary.” Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access? “As I mention below, I'm currently working on a Roadmap which will take me out of Early Access. This roadmap will take me through 2022.” How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? “My current Roadmap is to implement Xeno Ship Boarding. This milestone will focus heavily on varied content, polished features, and more progression and goals, so once it is complete, Rodina will hopefully be rich enough to take out of Early Access.\n\n\n\nOver the long run, I aim towards making Rodina a \"Daggerfall in Space\".” What is the current state of the Early Access version? “Rodina is currently a \"full game\" in the sense that it is meant to be played from start to finish, and that there are minimal bugs. You can explore the entire solar system, fight with hundreds of enemy Xenos (both in FPS and Ship combat), create your own race of Robot Babies, and investigate dozens of journals and books giving you the game's backstory.\n\n \n\n However, Rodina is still not \"full\" in the sense that there isn't currently enough content. That's what I'm working on right now!” Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access? “Possibly, yes. If RODINA ever gets a major new feature like Multiplayer, I will increase the price.” How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? “The community is very important to me. I interact on the forums constantly, and am always listening to feedback. Users help me test the game, and keep it generally stable.\n\n \n\n Every once in a while I do an informal \"vote\" to determine what milestone to work on next. I always have plans, but sometimes it's fun to get structured feedback from my customers. I really enjoy getting the community involved!”Rodina (political party) - Wikipedia: The All-Russian Political Party \"Rodina\"[a] is a nationalist[1] political party in Russia. It was a coalition of thirty nationalist groups[10] that was established by Dmitry Rogozin,[10] Sergey Glazyev,[10] Sergey Baburin,[10] Viktor Gerashchenko, Georgy Shpak, Valentin Varennikov and others in August 2003. The party's ideology combines \"patriotism, nationalism, and a greater role for the government in the economy\",[10] and is described as pro-Kremlin.[11] Its headquarters is located in Moscow.\n\nIn the 2003 legislative elections, Rodina won 9.02% of the vote and ended up with 37 of the 450 seats in the State Duma. In the 2016 elections, it won 1.51% of the vote and ended up with one seat. In the 2021 elections, it won 0.80% of the vote and ended up with one seat. The party supports President Vladimir Putin.[12]\n\nThe term rodina (Russian: родина) means \"motherland\".[10] It is one of three words in the Russian language that express the concept of \"native land\". Otechestvo (отечество) and оtchizna (oтчизна) both translate into English as \"fatherland\" and \"relate to the country in which one is a citizen\". Rodina means one's birthplace and is identified with the nation's soul.[13]\n\nFollowing allegations brought by the Communist Party and ousted reform-oriented liberal parties such as the Union of Right Forces and Yabloko that President Vladimir Putin's United Russia had manipulated elections to ensure a favorable outcome, Rodina declined to field its own candidate in the 2004 presidential elections. This created a schism within Rodina as Sergey Glazyev insisted on running for President under the banner of an officially separate Rodina party, but Dmitry Rogozin was able to consolidate his support and defeat Glazyev.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2003 legislative elections, the party mostly supported the policies of President Putin. However, four Rodina deputies, including Dmitry Rogozin, went on a public hunger strike and locked themselves in their offices at the State Duma to protest the welfare reforms being pushed through by Putin's government in February 2005. The bloc since increasingly adopted the slogan Za Putina, Protiv Pravitel'stva (\"For Putin, Against the Government\") and stated that its immediate goal was to win a parliamentary majority in the 2007 legislative elections.\n\nOn 27 January 2005, nineteen members of the State Duma, including members of Rodina and the Communist Party, signed a petition to the prosecutor-general demanding that Jewish organisations be banned in the Russian Federation.[9] This caused a political scandal, with President Putin (who was participating in commemorations for the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on the day that the petition was issued) expressing shame over the petition's content and the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews issuing a statement roundly criticising the petition and its signers. The prosecutor-general in a later investigation declined to charge the signatories of the petition with fomenting racial hatred. In July 2005, the party's co-leader Sergey Baburin left the bloc, taking nine Duma deputies with him and forming an alternative group in the State Duma, which also calls itself Motherland. The split led to a reunification of Dmitry Rogozin's and Sergey Glazyev's supporters. Rogozin accused the Kremlin of waging a dirty war against his bloc, which he claims is feared by the United Russia party because of its potential electoral support. Rogozin had also announced intentions to take legal action against the State Duma for allowing Baburin to register his bloc in the Duma as Motherland, creating a potential for confusion within the electorate.\n\nOn 6 November 2005, Rodina was barred from taking part in the December elections to the Moscow Duma following a complaint filed by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia that Rodina's advertising campaign incited racial hatred.[9] The advertisement in question showed Caucasian immigrants tossing watermelon rinds to the ground and ended with the slogan \"Let's clear our city of trash\", calling for Russians to clean their cities of rubbish.[9][14][15][16][17] It garnered much controversy and opinion polls predicted that Rodina would come second with close to 25% in the December vote. Rogozin appealed the decision, but the ban was upheld on 1 December 2005.[18][17]\n\nRodina's difficulties continued into 2006, when it failed to obtain permission to contest local elections in a number of regions.[14] However, the party did come third in the regional elections in Altai Republic. Rogozin unexpectedly stepped down as party leader in March 2006 and was replaced by the less known businessman Alexander Babakov. Many suspected this was a tactical decision on Rodina's part to ease pressure from the Kremlin, although a small number of party members in Moscow had been vocal in their criticism of Rogozin's more outlandish nationalist rhetoric. On 28 October 2006, Rodina merged with the Russian Party of Life and the Russian Pensioners' Party into a new party called A Just Russia. Many of Rodina's parliamentary faction joined the new party, except for Rogozin, Andrey Savelyev and Glazyev, who at present does not belong to any party. In 2007, Rogozin was appointed Russian Ambassador to NATO.\n\nRodina was reinstated on 29 September 2012 and Aleksey Zhuravlyov, formally a member of the ruling United Russia, was unanimously voted to lead the party.[citation needed] Rodina endorsed President Vladimir Putin in the 2018 Russian presidential election.[19]\n\nIn July 2017, the chairman of Rodina announced that the only candidate whom the party will support is current President Vladimir Putin for the 2018 presidential election.[20]\n\nIn December 2023, Rodina announced that the party will support current President Vladimir Putin for the 2024 presidential election.[21]\n\nThe party was described as \"far-right\" by Timothy Snyder in The New York Review of Books in March 2014.[9]\n\nNovaya Gazeta journalist Anna Politkovskaya stated that Rodina was a chauvinistic organisation that had been \"created by the Kremlin's spin doctors\" for the 2003 election and the \"aim was to draw moderately nationalist voters away from the more extreme National Bolsheviks\".[22] The Guardian claims that Rodina was \"set up by President Vladimir Putin's allies\" in 2003 \"to leach votes from the Communist party\".[16]\n\nRodina and its leader Dmitry Rogozin has made illegal immigration and a \"Moscow for Muscovites!\" platform a centerpiece of their election campaign.[23] While initially including left-wing factions (that later split away and merged into A Just Russia), the party is currently anti-communist and supports the decommunization of Russia.[24]The Rodina: Sonic Acts Festival – The Noise of BeingThe First Republic (TV Series 2014–2018) ⭐ 6.6 | Drama: This movie is what I would call a Sleeper.

Století - Wikipedia: XIII. Století ('13th Century') is a Czech band from Jihlava playing gothic rock and hard rock. Initially, the band's style was post-punk, and the band's name was HNF - Hrdinové Nové Fronty[1][2] (\"Heroes of The New Front\").\n\nThe band is mostly popular in Poland.[3]Bezděz Castle - Wikipedia: Bezděz Castle (Czech: hrad Bezděz) is a Gothic castle in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic. It is located about 20 kilometres (12 mi) southeast of Česká Lípa. Its construction began before 1264 by order of King Ottokar II of Bohemia.\n\nThe royal castle of Bezděz was one of the most important Gothic castles in the Czech lands until its destruction in the Thirty Years' War.[1] Erected between 1260 and 1280 on the phonolite hill of Velký Bezděz, 604 metres (1,982 ft) above sea level, it became the characteristic landmark of the local landscape and met the demands for an inaccessible as well as respectable royal castle.\n\nA year after Ottokar II's death, the castle Bezděz, which was still unfinished, became the place of imprisonment of Queen Kunhuta and her underage son Wenceslaus II, kept under lock and key in very spartan conditions by Wenceslaus's guardian Ota Braniborský, Margrave of Brandenburg, after the Battle on the Marchfeld.[2] The boy, only 6 or 7 at the time, remained there alone when his mother escaped under a pretext and it is widely accepted that the place left its mark on him. As an adult, and ruling monarch, he returned to Bezděz to order the construction of a chapel, one of the best preserved areas of the castle today.\n\nThe castle complex was completed during the reign of Wenceslaus II, who used the local forests very frequently for hunting and relaxation.[3] It served for this purpose until the Thirty Years' War when, as part of the round of confiscations after the Battle of the White Mountain, it fell into the hands of Albrecht of Wallenstein. The famous general started turning the castle into a fortress in 1623, but then halted the construction work. In 1627 he decided that it should be rebuilt into a monastery for the Benedictines from Montserrat, who later brought a copy of the Virgin of Montserrat (the Black Madonna) in 1666, making the castle a pilgrimage site for years to come.[2]\n\nIn 1686 Stations of the Cross were built along the path to the castle and the whole complex served for religious purposes until 1785, when the monastery was dissolved on the orders of Joseph II.[3] Pilgrimages were banned and the castle became forlorn, slowly becoming dilapidated. The Romantic Movement's passion for medieval monuments helped preserve the castle, which is a sole preserved example of an unaltered castle of the 13th century.\n\nParts that are accessible to visitors are the castle precincts including the royal palace, burgrave's house and the unique early Gothic chapel. The castle tower serves as an observation tower. The castle's romantic silhouette gave rise to many legends and inspired a great number of writers, artists and composers, the most famous of whom included the poet Karel Hynek Mácha and the composer Bedřich Smetana."}

I joined just as I entered my teen years, in the fall of 1976, shortly after I discovered the wonder of science fiction digests.\n\nI remember the bulletin of the SFBC, Things to Come, arriving in our mailbox every month, and eagerly perusing the offerings to see if I wanted grab any of the featured selections or alternates, or something from the backlist. The SFBC purchase I most vividly recall reading was the Isaac Asimov edited anthology, Before the Golden Age, which was filled with great stories as well as fascinating biographical material by Asimov on his early days as a fan. Other favorite volumes include Leigh Brackett’s The Book of Skaith, Damon Knight’s Science Fiction of the Thirties and The Futurians, Frederik Pohl’s The Early Pohl, Frank Herbert’s Dune series and Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Mars books, among many others. I remained a member through college before finally letting my membership lapse.\n\nOne of the benefits of being a member of the SFBC was receiving their bulletin, Things to Come. While the art inside sometimes just reproduced the dust jacket art, in many cases the art was created solely for the bulletin, and was not used in the book or anywhere else. Because one can never collect enough things, I gradually started collecting back issues of Things to Come for the art, particularly for the art of Virgil Finlay which began appearing in the bulletin in 1959. In 2005, I gathered those Finlay illos from the bulletins that I’d collected and published a small press booklet, Virgil Finlay: The Art of Things to Come.\n\n[Click the images for Things to beCome larger]\n\nThe first issue of Things to Come was dated March-April 1953, concurrent with the launch of the SFBC. I’ve not been able to find any of those 1953 issues, and only have two of the six issues from 1954. From 1955 to 2000, however, my run is missing a total of 10 issues, with three of those being from 1960.\n\nThe bulletin ran as a bi-monthly until the issue dated July 1969, when it changed to monthly. Nearly all of the art for the first 20 years of Things to Come is exclusive to that bulletin, and as a result hasn’t been seen by many SF fans. In this series, I’ll reproduce some of that art, chosen by virtue of the art, the story that it illustrates or the author of the story.\n\nThis first installment will feature art from 1957 and earlier, with future installments focusing on two or three years’ worth of Things to Come. I’m not going to hold myself to a hard cutoff in terms of number of images, but each installment will feature roughly a dozen images from the applicable period, which will be presented chronologically.\n\nScience Fiction Book Club ad in the February 1953 Astounding SF: inside back cover and back covers\n\nThe earliest ad for the SFBC appears to be the one that ran on the back (and inside back) cover of the February 1953 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, which I’ll show here. A reader could select any three of six selections for only $1.00. The choices:\n\nNone of these became featured selections in Things to Come, but were available to new members or as part of the backlist that ran in Things to Come.\n\nThe selections available in the first bulletin, March-April 1953, were Asimov’s The Currents of Space (the March selection) and Edgar Pangborn’s West of the Sun (the April selection). Asimov’s Second Foundation became the selection for November 1953, making Asimov the only author to have two selections in the first year of the SFBC.\n\nThings to Come, March/April 1954, featuring J.T. McIntosh’s Born Leader, and hardcover edition (art by Powers)\n\nThe first issue of the bulletin that I own is that for the SFBC’s first anniversary, March-April 1954. From that I’ve selected the art for J.T. McIntosh’s Born Leader (his second selection, following World Out of Mind from August 1953). The illo has a classic 1950’s feel, but has a problem common with much of the art in Things to Come from this period. Namely, that the artist is not identified.\n\nFor the most part, at this early time the artists used by the SFBC were not also doing digest or paperback SF art, making their identification next to impossible. The cover for the book itself was by one of the greats of the period, Richard Powers, which is also shown above for contrast.\n\nJumping ahead just over a year, the May-June 1955 issue finds Timeliner by Charles Eric Maine as the May selection. Although the year is 2035, the spacesuit screams the 1950’s.\n\nThings to Come August 1955, featuring The Martian Way\n\nThe following issue has Asimov’s The Martian Way as the August 1955 selection. In each bi-monthly issue, the first month’s selection always grabbed the cover and a column of text on the second page, leaving the second month’s selection to generally get more of a double-page spread. This piece was done by one of the regulars for the SFBC during this period; an artist who signed his or her name as Tesar. I’ve not been able to dig up any info on him or her, however.\n\nThings to Come October 1955, with Martians, Go Home\n\nTesar also contributes the art for Fredric Brown’s classic, Martians, Go Home, which was the October 1955 selection. In keeping with the novel, this one was presented in a more humorous vein.\n\nThings to Come February 1956, offering Brackett’s The Long Tomorrow\n\nMoving into 1956, the February selection finds the great Leigh Brackett present with her novel, “The Long Tomorrow.” This was the SFBC’s first selection by a female author, although an anthology edited by Judith Merrill, Beyond the Barriers of Space and Time, had been the March 1955 selection nearly a year earlier.\n\nEarthman, Come Home (July 1956) and The Power (September 1956). Art by Tesar.\n\nJames Blish’s famous Cities in Flight series grabbed the July 1956 selection slot with Earthman, Come Home.\n\nAnother Tesar piece illustrates Frank Robinson’s The Power, which was the September 1956 selection. This was later filmed in 1968 with George Pal producing, but Frank hated the film (though he told me he was perfectly happy to cash the checks).\n\nThe Best Science Fiction 1956 (November 1956) and The Best from F&SF, Sixth Series (March 1957)\n\nMany Best of the Year anthologies were selected by the SFBC, and one of those was the November 1956 selection, The Best Science Fiction Stories and Novels: 1956, edited by Ted E. Dikty. The illustration is signed Cliff, but I’ve not been able to identify the artist beyond that.\n\nI have some vague hope that someday I’ll identify Tesar, but identifying an artist who just goes by “Cliff” will likely prove a tougher challenge.\n\nIn the same issue of Things to Come, the December 1956 selection was Heinlein’s classic Double Star. Cliff also contributed the art for this selection, as the same artist usually provided the art for both month’s selections in a bulletin.\n\nEmpire of the Atom, feature section for February 1957\n\nOne of the original “Big Three” of science fiction was A.E. van Vogt, and his Empire of the Atom was the February 1957 selection.\n\nAnthony Boucher’s The Best from Fantasy and Science Fiction was one of the most famous anthologies during the period, collecting tales from The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. The sixth installment nabbed the slot for the March 1957 selection, along with a swarm of presumably hostile insects by Tesar.\n\nInside that same issue of Things to Come, Asimov returned with the April 1957 selection, his classic The Naked Sun. Tesar’s robot bears some resemblance to Robby the Robot, who had appeared a year earlier in Forbidden Planet, but I’m sure any likeness was coincidental…\n\nWhile the ads for the SFBC that appeared in the SF digests generally just depicted the jackets of the books as published, occasionally they also featured specially commissioned art that appeared in neither the book nor Things to Come. I’ll show one example of that below, with this ad showcasing The Naked Sun taken from the back cover of Astounding Science Fiction, November 1957.\n\nSFBC ad featuring The Naked Sun (back cover for Astounding Science Fiction, November 1957)\n\n and Strangers in the Universe (Things to Come selection for May 1957)\n\nClifford Simak’s collection Strangers in the Universe appeared as the May 1957 selection.\n\nI’ll close this initial installment looking at the art of Things to Come with an illo for the July 1957 selection. Time for the Stars was another by Heinlein, and was touted as “The Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year.” Would they lie to you?\n\nThings to Come (July 1957) featuring Time for the Stars by Heinlein\n\nIn our next installment, I’ll cover 1958 through 1960. And if anyone happens to have a copy of the September-October 1959, May-June 1960, July-August 1960 or November-December 1960 bulletins, please let me know!\n\nDoug is a collector of pulps, as well as of pulp, science fiction and fantasy art.

The successful launch came as a shock to experts and citizens in the United States, who had hoped that the United States would accomplish this scientific advancement first.\n\nThe fact that the Soviets were successful fed fears that the U.S. military had generally fallen behind in developing new technology. As a result, the launch of Sputnik served to intensify the arms race and raise Cold War tensions. During the 1950s, both the United States and the Soviet Union were working to develop new technology. Nazi Germany had been close to developing the world’s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) near the end of the Second World War, and German scientists aided research in both countries in the wake of that conflict. Both countries were also engaged in developing satellites as a part of a goal set by the International Council of Scientific Unions, which had called for the launch of satellite technology during late 1957 or 1958. Over the course of the decade, the United States tested several varieties of rockets and missiles, but all of these tests ended in failure.\n\nThe Soviet launch of the first Sputnik satellite was one accomplishment in a string of technological successes. Few in the United States had anticipated it, and even those who did were not aware of just how impressive it would be. At 184 pounds, the Russian satellite was much heavier than anything the United States was developing at the time, and its successful launch was quickly followed by the launch of two additional satellites, including one that carried a dog into space. Together, these orbited the earth every 90-minutes and created fear that the United States lagged far behind in technological capability. These concerns were compounded when the United States learned that the Soviet Union also tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile that year.\n\nAlthough President Dwight Eisenhower had tried to downplay the importance of the Sputnik launch to the American people, he poured additional funds and resources into the space program in an effort to catch up. The U.S. Government suffered a severe setback in December of 1957 when its first artificial satellite, named Vanguard, exploded on the launch pad, serving as a very visible reminder of how much the country had yet to accomplish to be able to compete militarily with the Soviets. At last, on January 31, 1958, the United States succeeded in launching its first satellite, the Explorer. The Explorer was still slighter than Sputnik, but its launch sent it deeper into space. The Soviets responded with yet another launch, and the space race continued.\n\nThe success of Sputnik had a major impact on the Cold War and the United States. Fear that they had fallen behind led U.S. policymakers to accelerate space and weapons programs. In the late 1950s, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev boasted about Soviet technological superiority and growing stockpiles of ICBMs, so the United States worked simultaneously to develop its own ICBMs to counter what it assumed was a growing stockpile of Soviet missiles directed against the United States. With both countries researching new technology, talk of creating a treaty banning nuclear testing faded away for several years. In this way, the launch of Sputnik fueled both the space race and the arms race, in addition to increasing Cold War tensions, as each country worked to prepare new methods of attacking the other. Eventually, lawmakers and political campaigners in the United States successfully exploited the fear of a “missile gap” developing between U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals in the 1960 presidential election, which brought John F. Kennedy to power over Eisenhower’s vice president, Richard Nixon. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 served to remind both sides of the dangers of the weapons they were developing.George M. Humphrey (1953 - 1957): Appointed Secretary of the Treasury by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953, George M. Humphrey (1890 - 1970) advocated a free market economy. He believed that the less the Government did, the more the American people would prosper, and he recommended a reduced federal budget and a cut in taxes to spur individual initiative.\n\nHumphrey adopted a policy of offering government securities at the higher market rate of interest, rather than at the fixed Federal Reserve rate, to attract investment by the general public and to reduce the proportion of such securities held by Federal Reserve banks. He enlivened Cabinet meetings with polemics on the need for checking federal deficits, delivered as ardently as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles' exhortations on checking Communist expansion. In response to Eisenhower's 1953 budget he quipped, \"There are a lot of places in this budget that can be cut.\" He warned that the \"terrific\" tax burden must be eased or \"I will predict that you will have a depression that will curl your hair.\" He placed the national debt on a longer term basis in order to ward off further inflation. Humphrey resigned from office in 1957.\n\nBorn and trained as an artist in England, Thomas Edgar Stephens (1886 - 1966) came to this country in 1929 and became a United States citizen. Between 1946 and 1960 he painted twenty-four portraits of Dwight D. Eisenhower, for various institutions and individuals, and later induced the former president to take up painting as a hobby. Stephens also painted the entire Eisenhower Cabinet. His portrait of George M. Humphrey was painted from life in 1957."}

pronunciation: [ˈjozɛf ˈtʃapɛk]; 23 March 1887 – April 1945[1]) was a Czech artist who was best known as a painter, but who was also noted as a writer and a poet. He invented the word \"robot\", which was introduced into literature by his brother, Karel Čapek.\n\nČapek was born in Hronov, Bohemia (Austria-Hungary, later Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic) in 1887. First a painter of the Cubist school, he later developed his own playful, minimalist style. He collaborated with his brother Karel on a number of plays and short stories; on his own, he wrote the utopian play Land of Many Names and several novels, as well as critical essays in which he argued for the art of the unconscious, of children, and of 'savages'. He was named by his brother as the true inventor of the term robot.[2][3] As a cartoonist, he worked for Lidové noviny, a newspaper based in Prague.\n\nHis illustrated stories Povídání o Pejskovi a Kočičce (English translation as The Adventures of Puss and Pup[4]) are considered classics of Czech children's literature.\n\nDue to his critical attitude towards national socialism and Adolf Hitler, he was arrested after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. He wrote Poems from a Concentration Camp in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where he died in 1945. In June 1945 Rudolf Margolius, accompanied by Čapek's wife Jarmila Čapková, went to Bergen-Belsen to search for him.[5] His remains were never found. In 1948 the court officially set the date of his death as 30 April 1947.[6]\n• Ze života hmyzu (Pictures from the Insects' Life), 1921 – with Karel Čapek\n• Povídání o pejskovi a kočičce (The Adventures of Puss and Pup), 1929\n• Dášeňka, čili život štěněte (Dashenka, consequently the life of a Puppy) – with Karel Čapek, illustrated by Josef\n• Ivan Margolius, 'The Robot of Prague', Newsletter, The Friends of Czech Heritage no. 17, Autumn 2017, pp. 3 – 6. https://czechfriends.net/images/RobotsMargoliusJul2017.pdf Archived 11 September 2017 at the Wayback Machine\n• Works by or about Josef Čapek at Wikisource\n• Josef Čapek at Library of Congress, with 70 library catalogue records\n• Bratří Čapkové (The Brothers Čapek) at LC Authorities, with 6 recordsVáclav Špála - Wikipedia: Václav Špála (24 August 1885 in Žlunice – 13 May 1946 in Prague) was a Czech painter, graphic designer and illustrator.\n\nHe studied at Prague Academy. He was a member of the group Tvrdošíjní (The Obstinate) and exhibited with them. At the beginning of his career, his work was influenced by Fauvism, later by Cubism. From 1909 he was a member of the Manes Association. From 1911 he was also a member of the Group of Fine Artists in Prague, a group of young Czech modernists embracing cubism and including artists like Vincenc Benes, Josef Capek, Emil Filla or Otto Gutfreund. The Group of Fine Artists organized in 1912 two significant exhibitions in the newly opened exhibition halls of the Municipal House in Prague.[1] Since 1923 he painted mainly landscapes and still-lives.\n\nVáclav Špála ranks among the greatest phenomena of Czech modern art. Czech society alternately rejected him and lavished him with uncritical praise. Špála remains one of the most searched-for artists in the country. His paintings decorate not only classrooms but also numerous offices and living rooms. Špála was one of the first artists to be recognised with the title National Artist, and was awarded it in 1946.\n\nSince 1959 The Václav Špála Gallery carries his name. He is buried at the Vyšehrad Cemetery.\n• Richard Drury: Václav Špála (1885 - 1946), Prague : The Czech Museum of Fine Arts, 2004, exhibition catalogue, 83pp., ISBN 80-7056-107-6, (Czech) andJan Zrzavý - Wikipedia: Zrzavý was born on 5 November 1890 in Vadín in Bohemia (today a part of Okrouhlice in the Czech Republic). He studied privately in Prague and then attended the UMPRUM there for 2 years starting in 1907, before being expelled. He first visited France in 1907, returning to Paris and Brittany frequently until 1939, but maintaining close links to his homeland.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1958, he lived and worked in Vodňany.[1] After the war he became an associate professor at Palacký University of Olomouc from 1947 to 1950. Later he maintained private studios in Prague and Okrouhlice. He grew increasingly recognized on a national and international level in the 1950s and 1960s, and was honoured a title of a National Artist in 1965.\n\nHe died in Prague on 12 October 1977, at the age of 86. At his request, he was buried in Krucemburk, which he liked to visit and where his father came from.[2]\n\nZrzavý was a key member of the Czech, and more broadly European, modernism movement the early part of the 20th century. Although he is regarded as a symbolist he was heavily influenced by European Medieval art. Throughout his life he was also inspired by spectacular landscapes, both abroad (France, Italy, and Greece) as well as in his native country (Vodňany, Okrouhlice, Prague). He reworked many of his themes multiple times.

It has about 600 inhabitants. The municipality has a significant Polish minority.\n\nŘeka is located about 15 kilometres (9 mi) east of Frýdek-Místek and 27 km (17 mi) southeast of Ostrava. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range. The highest point is the Šindelná mountain at 1,100 m (3,600 ft) above sea level, located on the southeastern municipal border. The Ropičanka Stream originates in the municipal territory and then flows across the municipality.\n\nŘeka was founded in 1644 was formed by the separation from Smilovice and Guty, and originally named Řeka smilovská. It belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen. The village was established as a typical mountain settlement by associating already existing scattered mountain pastures and mountain farms. In the following years, other small farmers settled in the newly formed village. The main source of livelihood of the inhabitants was mountain farming.[2]\n\nAfter Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880–1910, the majority were native Polish-speakers (between 95.5% and 99.6%) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 19 or 4.1% in 1890) and Czech-speaking people (growing from 1 in 1880 to 10 in 1910).[2] In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Protestants (92.6%), followed by Roman Catholics (6.8%) and 3 people adhering to another faiths (but not Jewish).[3]\n\nAfter World War I, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Czechoslovakia. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Trans-Olza region it was annexed by Poland, administratively adjoined to Cieszyn County of Silesian Voivodeship.[4] It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia.\n\nPolish minority makes up 10.1% of the population.[5]\n\nThere are no railways or major roads passing through the municipality.\n\nThere is a small ski resort in the municipality.[2]\n\nŘeka is poor in historic monuments. The only protected cultural monument is a wooden folk house from the mid-19th century.[8]Plzeň - Wikipedia: Plzeň (Czech pronunciation: [ˈpl̩zɛɲ] ⓘ), also known in English and German as Pilsen ( German: [ˈpɪlzn̩] ⓘ), is a city in the Czech Republic. It is the fourth most populous city in the Czech Republic with about 186,000 inhabitants. It is located about 78 kilometres (48 miles) west of Prague, at the confluence of four rivers: Mže, Úhlava, Úslava and Radbuza, together forming the Berounka River.\n\nFounded as a royal city in the late 13th century, Plzeň became an important town for trade on routes linking Bohemia with Bavaria. By the 14th century it had grown to be the third largest city in Bohemia. The city was besieged three times during the 15th-century Hussite Wars, when it became a centre of resistance against the Hussites. During the Thirty Years' War in the early 17th century the city was temporarily occupied after the Siege of Plzeň.\n\nIn the 19th century, the city rapidly industrialised and became home to the Škoda Works, which became one of the most important engineering companies in Austria-Hungary and later in Czechoslovakia. The city is known worldwide as the home of Pilsner beer, created by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll in the city in 1842; today, the Pilsner Urquell Brewery is the largest brewery in the Czech Republic.\n\nPlzeň serves as the main business centre of West Bohemia and the capital of the Plzeň Region. The city is a cultural heritage zone known for its Baroque architecture, and was European Capital of Culture in 2015. Plzeň is home to football club FC Viktoria Plzeň, one of the most successful clubs in the Czech league, and ice hockey club HC Škoda Plzeň.\n\nPlzeň consists of ten self-governing boroughs.[2] In addition, Plzeň consists of 25 municipal parts, whose borders do not respect the boundaries of boroughs (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):[3]\n\nPlzeň is located about 78 km (48 mi) west of Prague.[4] The city is situated at the confluences of four rivers: Mže, Úhlava, Úslava and Radbuza. From the confluence of the Mže and Radbuza, the river is known as the Berounka. Plzeň lies mostly in the Plasy Uplands, with small parts of the municipal territory extending into the Švihov Highlands to the east and south. The highest point is the hill Chlum at 416 m (1,365 ft) above sea level. The lowest point is the river bed of the Berounka at 293 m (961 ft).[5] The largest body of water is the České údolí Reservoir, built on the Radbuza. A system of fishponds is located on the northern edge of the city.\n\nPlzeň has a cool and temperate Oceanic climate (Cfb). The average annual precipitation is 525 mm (21 in). The annual average temperature is 8.4 °C (47.1 °F). The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from −28.0 °C (−18.4 °F) on 12 February 1985 to 40.1 °C (104.2 °F) on 27 July 1983.[6]\n\nThe first written mention of Plzeň Castle is from 976. The city of New Plzeň was founded nearby in 1295 by King Wenceslaus II. The old settlement then became known as Starý Plzenec and New Plzeň became known as Plzeň. It quickly became an important city on trade routes leading from Bohemia to Nuremberg and Regensburg. The first written mention about beer brewing is from 1307. In the 14th century, the city had about 3,000 inhabitants on an area of 20 ha (49 acres), making it the third largest city in Bohemia after Prague and Kutná Hora.[12]\n\nDuring the Hussite Wars, it was the centre of Catholic resistance to the Hussites: Prokop the Great unsuccessfully besieged it three times, and it joined the league of Catholic nobles against King George of Poděbrady. In the 1470s and 1480s, the city had the first printing press in Bohemia. The first book printed here and therefore the oldest book in Bohemia is Statuta written by Arnošt of Pardubice, which was printed in 1476.[12]\n\nEmperor Rudolf II made Plzeň his seat from 1599 to 1600. During the Thirty Years' War the town was taken by Mansfeld in 1618 after the Siege of Plzeň and it was not recaptured by Imperial troops until 1621. Wallenstein made it his winter quarters in 1633. Accused of treason and losing the support of his army, he fled the town on 23 February 1634 to Eger/Cheb where he was assassinated two days later. The town was increasingly threatened by the Swedes in the last years of the war. The city commander Jan van der Croon strengthened the fortifications of Plzeň from 1645 to 1649. Swedish troops passed the town in 1645 and 1648 without attacking it. The town and region have been staunchly Catholic despite the Hussite Wars.[13]\n\nFrom the end of the 17th century, the architecture of Plzeň has been influenced by the Baroque style.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century Plzeň, already an important trade centre for Bohemia, near the Bavarian/German border, began to industrialise rapidly. In 1869 Emil Škoda founded the Škoda Works, which became the most important and influential engineering company in the country and a crucial supplier of arms to the Austro-Hungarian Army. By 1917 the Škoda Works employed over 30,000 workers.\n\nAfter 1898 the second largest employer was the National Railways train workshop, with about 2,000 employees: this was the largest rail repair shop in all Austria-Hungary. Between 1861 and 1877, the Plzeň railway junction was completed and in 1899 the first tram line started in the city. This burst of industry had two important effects: the growth of the local Czech population and of the urban poor. After 1868 the first Czech mayor of the city was elected.\n\nFollowing Czechoslovak independence from Austria-Hungary in 1918 the ethnic German minority in the countryside bordering the city of Plzeň hoped to be united with Austria and were unhappy at being included in Czechoslovakia. Many allied themselves to the Nazis after 1933 in the hope that Adolf Hitler might be able to unite them with their German-speaking neighbours.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing the Munich Agreement in 1938, Plzeň became a frontier town as the creation of the Sudetenland moved Nazi Germany's borders closer to the city's outer limits. During the German occupation from 1939 to 1945, the Škoda Works in Pilsen was forced to provide armaments for the Wehrmacht, and Czech contributions, particularly in the field of tanks, were noted. The Nazis operated a Gestapo prison in the city,[14] and a forced labour camp in the Karlov district.[15]\n\nBetween 17 and 26 January 1942, the majority of the city's Jewish population, over 2,000 people, were deported by the Nazis to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Terezín.\n\nOn 6 May 1945, in the final days before the end of World War II in Europe, Plzeň was liberated from Nazi Germany by the 16th Armored Division of General George Patton's 3rd Army. Also participating in the liberation of the city were elements of the 97th and 2nd Infantry Divisions supported by the Polish Holy Cross Mountains Brigade. Other Third Army units liberated major portions of Western Bohemia. The rest of Czechoslovakia was liberated from German control by the Soviet Red Army. Elements of the 3rd Army, as well as units from the 1st Army, remained in Plzeň until late November 1945.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the end of the war, the city's ethnic German minority population was expelled and their property was confiscated in accordance to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement.\n\nAfter the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, the government launched a currency reform in 1953, which caused a wave of discontent, including the Plzeň uprising. On 1 June 1953, over 20,000 people, mainly workers at the Škoda Works, began protesting against the government. Protesters forced their way into the town hall and threw communist symbols, furniture and other objects out of the windows. The protest caused a retaliation from the government. As part of its retaliation, they destroyed the statue of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia. The statue has since been re-erected.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1954, a West German homing pigeon was lost near the Czechoslovak border. It returned two days later, bearing a strong anticommunist message, signed \"Unbowed Pilsen.\" The bird, named Leaping Lena, was taken to the United States, where it was celebrated as a Cold War hero.[16][17][18]\n\nPlzeň is a centre of business in the western part of the Czech Republic.\n\nSince the late 1990s the city has experienced high growth in foreign investment. In 2007, Israeli mall developer Plaza Centers opened the Pilsen Plaza, a 20,000 m2 (220,000 sq ft) shopping mall and entertainment centre featuring a multiplex cinema from Cinema City Czech Republic.\n\nPlzeň produces about two-thirds of the Plzeň Region GDP, even though it contains only 29.8% of its population.[21] Based on these figures, the city of Plzeň has a total GDP of approximately $7.2 billion, and a per capita GDP of $44,000. While part of this is explained by commuters to the city, it is one of the most prosperous cities in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Škoda company, established in Plzeň in 1859, has been an important element of Austro-Hungarian, Czechoslovak and Czech engineering, and one of the biggest European arms factories. During the Communist era (1948–1989) the company's production had been directed to the needs of the Eastern Bloc. Disarray in the era after the Velvet Revolution, and unsuccessful efforts to gain new Western markets, resulted in sales problems and debts. After a huge restructuring process, the company was divided into several subsidiaries, which were later sold. The most important successors companies are Škoda Transportation and Doosan Škoda Power.[22]\n\nMany foreign companies now have manufacturing bases in Plzeň, including Daikin, Hisense and Panasonic. The software provider company ZF Openmatics was founded and is headquartered in this city. There has been much discussion of redeveloping those large areas of the Škoda plant which the company no longer uses.\n\nStock, located in the Božkov district, is the biggest distillery in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Plzeň agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 328,000 inhabitants.\n\nPlzeň is well known for the Pilsner Urquell (since 1842) and Gambrinus (since 1869) breweries, currently owned by Asahi Group Holdings.\n\nPlzeň is an important city in the history of beer, including the development of Pilsner.[23] In 1375, Bohemian King Charles IV endowed the Dobrow Monastery near Plzeň with the beer right, and it is one of the oldest breweries to survive to modern times.[24][25] Many breweries were located in the interconnected deep cellars of the city.[26][27]\n\nThe officials of Plzeň founded a city-owned brewery in 1839, Bürger Brauerei (Citizens' Brewery, now Plzeňský Prazdroj),[28] and recruited Bavarian brewer Josef Groll (1813–1887) who produced the first batch of modern Pilsner beer on 5 October 1842. This included mastering the art of triple decoction mashing.[23] The combination of pale colour from the new malts, Plzeň's remarkably soft water, Saaz noble hops from nearby Žatec (Saaz in German) and Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer which was regarded as a sensation. Improving transport meant that this new beer was soon available throughout Central Europe and Pilsner Brauart-style brewing was widely imitated.\n\nIn 1859, \"Pilsner Bier\" was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Plzeň. In 1898, the Pilsner Urquell trade mark was created to put emphasis on this being the brewery where the style originated.\n\nThe Plzeň metropolitan area is largely served by a network of trams, trolleybuses and buses operated by the PMDP. Like other continental European cities, tickets bought from vending machines or small shops are valid for any transport run by the city of Plzeň. For residents of the city, a Plzeň Card can be purchased and through a system of \"topping up\" be used on any public transport with no limitations, as long as it is paid up and valid. Tickets can be purchased in vehicles with a contactless smart card.[29]\n\nPlzeň is an important centre of Czech railway transport, with the crossing of five main railway lines:\n\nPlzeň main railway station (Plzeň hlavní nádraží) serves all five of these lines.\n\nThe most important transport link in the city is the D5 highway connecting Prague and Nuremberg.\n\nA public domestic and private international airport is located 11 km south-west from Plzeň, at the nearby village of Líně.\n\nSince 31 May 1993 Plzeň has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plzeň. The first bishop (current bishop emeritus) was František Radkovský. The current bishop is Tomáš Holub. The diocese covers an area with a total of 818,700 inhabitants.[citation needed] The diocesan see is in St. Bartholomew's Cathedral on Republiky Square in Plzeň. The diocese is divided into 10 vicariates with a total of 72 parishes.\n\nThe seat of the West Bohemian seniorate (literary presbytery; Central European protestant equivalent of a diocese) of Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren is currently set in Plzeň. The current senior is Miroslav Hamari, the preacher of Koranda parish congregation of the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren in Plzeň, commonly known as Koranda congregation located in the city centre of Plzeň. The senioral churchwarden is Josef Beneš, the parish churchwarden of the same congregation. There are two other parish congregations of Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren in the Plzeň-City District – The Western congregation of the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren in Plzeň, known as The Western congregation located in the Western part of the city in the borough of Jižní předměstí and The Congregation of the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren in Chrást located in Chrást in the very east of Plzeň-City District.\n\nThe seat of Plzeň diocese of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church is located in Plzeň (although the bishop has resided in Mirovice for several years due to a reconstruction of episcopacy). The current bishop is Filip Štojdl.\n\nThe Czech Evangelical Lutheran Church is headquartered in Plzeň.[30] St. Paul's Lutheran Church is a church of the Czech Evangelical Lutheran Church in Plzeň.[31]\n\nThe other churches also present in Plzeň are the Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in the Czech Republic, the United Methodist Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Church of Brethren, the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, the Greek Catholic Church, and others.\n\nThe University of West Bohemia in Plzeň is well known for its Faculty of Law, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Faculty of Applied Science in particular.\n\nMartin Luther Elementary School (Základní škola Martina Luthera) is a private Christian school of the Czech Evangelical Lutheran Church in Plzeň.[32][30]\n\nPlzeň was a European Capital of Culture in 2015, along with Mons in Belgium.\n\nThe ice hockey club HC Škoda Plzeň plays in the Czech Extraliga. The team plays its home games at Home Monitoring Aréna. The football club FC Viktoria Plzeň plays in the Czech First League and belongs among the most successful clubs in the Czech Republic. Viktoria Plzeň has played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. The team plays its home games at Doosan Arena. Handball club Talent Plzeň plays in the Czech Handball Extraliga.\n\nThe motorcycle speedway team PK Plzeň race at the Plzeň speedway track. The track has hosted significant speedway events including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Team Cup.[33][34]\n\nThe most prominent sights of Plzeň are the Gothic St. Bartholomew's Cathedral, founded in the late 13th century, whose tower, at 102 m (335 ft), is the highest in the Czech Republic, the Renaissance Town Hall, and the Moorish Revival Great Synagogue, the second largest synagogue in Europe, after the Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest. There is also a 20 km (12 mi) historic tunnel and cellar network, among the longest in Central Europe. Part of this network is open to the public for tours of about 750 m (2,500 ft) in length and down to a depth of 12 m (39 ft).\n\nBuilt in 1532, the former water tower was integrated into the city's fortification system at Prague Gate. Another storey was added in 1822 in French Imperial style. The Gothic portal dating from the 1500s and coming from another house, which had been demolished, was added in 1912. Above the portal there is a commemorative plaque dedicated to Dr Josef Škoda (a professor at the Vienna University), who was born next door on 10 December 1805.\n\nA popular tourist attraction is the Plzeňský Prazdroj brewery tour where visitors can discover the history of beer.\n• Faculty of Law of the University of West BohemiaGoogle Maps: When you have eliminated the JavaScript, whatever remains must be an empty page.Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is the text of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII) (Pub.

In response, all three branches of the federal government--as well as the public at large--debated a fundamental constitutional question: Does the Constitution's prohibition of denying equal protection always ban the use of racial, ethnic, or gender criteria in an attempt to bring social justice and social benefits?\n\nIn June 1963, President John Kennedy asked Congress for a comprehensive civil rights bill, induced by massive resistance to desegregation and the murder of Medgar Evers. After Kennedy's assassination in November, President Lyndon Johnson pressed hard, with the support of Roy Wilkins and Clarence Mitchell, to secure the bill's passage the following year. In 1964, Congress passed Public Law 88-352 (78 Stat. 241). The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Provisions of this civil rights act forbade discrimination on the basis of sex, as well as, race in hiring, promoting, and firing. The Act prohibited discrimination in public accommodations and federally funded programs. It also strengthened the enforcement of voting rights and the desegregation of schools.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the nation's benchmark civil rights legislation, and it continues to resonate in America. Passage of the Act ended the application of \"Jim Crow\" laws, which had been upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson, in which the Court held that racial segregation purported to be \"separate but equal\" was constitutional. The Civil Rights Act was eventually expanded by Congress to strengthen enforcement of these fundamental civil rights.Civil Rights Act (1964): To enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the United States to provide injunctive relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the Attorney General to institute suits to protect constitutional rights in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity, and for other purposes.\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this Act may be cited as the \"Civil Rights Act of 1964\".\n\nTITLE I--VOTING RIGHTS\n\n SEC. 101.

Such request by the Attorney General shall be accompanied by a certificate that, in his opinion, the case is of general public importance. A copy of the certificate and request for a three-judge court shall be immediately furnished by such clerk to the chief judge of the circuit (or in his absence, the presiding circuit judge of the circuit) in which the case is pending.

(a) Whenever it is charged in writing under oath by a person claiming to be aggrieved, or a written charge has been filed by a member of the Commission where he has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this title has occurred (and such charge sets forth the facts upon which it is based) that an employer, employment agency, or labor organization has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the Commission shall furnish such employer, employment agency, or labor organization (hereinafter referred to as the \"respondent\") with a copy of such charge and shall make an investigation of such charge, provided that such charge shall not be made public by the Commission. If the Commission shall determine, after such investigation, that there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the Commission shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. Nothing said or done during and as a part of such endeavors may be made public by the Commission without the written consent of the parties, or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding. Any officer or employee of the Commission, who shall make public in any manner whatever any information in violation of this subsection shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year.\n\n(b) In the case of an alleged unlawful employment practice occurring in a State, or political subdivision of a State, which has a State or local law prohibiting the unlawful employment practice alleged and establishing or authorizing a State or local authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, no charge may be filed under subsection (a) by the person aggrieved before the expiration of sixty days after proceedings have been commenced under the State or local law, unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated, provided that such sixty-day period shall be extended to one hundred and twenty days during the first year after the effective date of such State or local law. If any requirement for the commencement of such proceedings is imposed by a State or local authority other than a requirement of the filing of a written and signed statement of the facts upon which the proceeding is based, the proceeding shall be deemed to have been commenced for the purposes of this subsection at the time such statement is sent by registered mail to the appropriate State or local authority.\n\n(c) In the case of any charge filed by a member of the Commission alleging an unlawful employment practice occurring in a State or political subdivision of a State, which has a State or local law prohibiting the practice alleged and establishing or authorizing a State or local authority to grant or seek relief from such practice or to institute criminal proceedings with respect thereto upon receiving notice thereof, the Commission shall, before taking any action with respect to such charge, notify the appropriate State or local officials and, upon request, afford them a reasonable time, but not less than sixty days (provided that such sixty-day period shall be extended to one hundred and twenty days during the first year after the effective day of such State or local law), unless a shorter period is requested, to act under such State or local law to remedy the practice alleged.\n\n(d) A charge under subsection (a) shall be filed within ninety days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, except that in the case of an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has followed the procedure set out in subsection (b), such charge shall be filed by the person aggrieved within two hundred and ten days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, or within thirty days after receiving notice that the State or local agency has terminated the proceedings under the State or local, law, whichever is earlier, and a copy of such charge shall be filed by the Commission with the State or local agency.\n\n(e) If within thirty days after a charge is filed with the Commission or within thirty days after expiration of any period of reference under subsection (c) (except that in either case such period may be extended to not more than sixty days upon a determination by the Commission that further efforts to secure voluntary compliance are warranted), the Commission has been unable to obtain voluntary compliance with this title, the Commission shall so notify the person aggrieved and a civil action may, within thirty days thereafter, be brought against the respondent named in the charge (1) by the person claiming to be aggrieved, or (2) if such charge was filed by a member of the Commission, by any person whom the charge alleges was aggrieved by the alleged unlawful employment practice. Upon application by the complainant and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant and may authorize the commencement of the action without the payment of fees, costs, or security. Upon timely application, the court may, in its discretion, permit the Attorney General to intervene in such civil action if he certifies that the case is of general public importance. Upon request, the court may, in its discretion, stay further proceedings for not more than sixty days pending the termination of State or local proceedings described in subsection (b) or the efforts of the Commission to obtain voluntary compliance.\n\n(f) Each United States district court and each United States court of a place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have jurisdiction of actions brought under this title. Such an action may be brought in any judicial district in the State in which the unlawful employment practice is alleged to have been committed, in the judicial district in which the employment records relevant to such practice are maintained and administered, or in the judicial district in which the plaintiff would have worked but for the alleged unlawful employment practice, but if the respondent is not found within any such district, such an action may be brought within the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office. For purposes of sections 1404 and 1406 of title 28 of the United States Code, the judicial district in which the respondent has his principal office shall in all cases be considered a district in which the action might have been brought.\n\n(g) If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice charged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in such unlawful employment practice, and order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, which may include reinstatement or hiring of employees, with or without back pay (payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice). Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall operate to reduce the back pay otherwise allowable. No order of the court shall require the admission or reinstatement of an individual as a member of a union or the hiring, reinstatement, or promotion of an individual as an employee, or the payment to him of any back pay, if such individual was refused admission, suspended, or expelled or was refused employment or advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex or national origin or in violation of section 704(a).\n\n(h) The provisions of the Act entitled \"An Act to amend the Judicial Code and to define and limit the jurisdiction of courts sitting in equity, and for other purposes,\" approved March 23, 1932 (29 U.S.C. 101-115), shall not apply with respect to civil actions brought under this section.\n\n(i) In any case in which an employer, employment agency, or labor organization fails to comply with an order of a court issued in a civil action brought under subsection (e), the Commission may commence proceedings to compel compliance with such order.\n\n(j) Any civil action brought under subsection (e) and any proceedings brought under subsection (i) shall be subject to appeal as provided in sections 1291 and 1292, title 28, United States Code.\n\n(k) In any action or proceeding under this title the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the Commission or the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs, and the Commission and the United States shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.\n\nSEC. 707. (a) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights secured by this title, and that the pattern or practice is of such a nature and is intended to deny the full exercise of the rights herein described, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States by filing with it a complaint (1) signed by him (or in his absence the Acting Attorney General), (2) setting forth facts pertaining to such pattern or practice, and (3) requesting such relief, including an application for a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order or other order against the person or persons responsible for such pattern or practice, as he deems necessary to insure the full enjoyment of the rights herein described.\n\n(b) The district courts of the United States shall have and shall exercise jurisdiction of proceedings instituted pursuant to this section, and in any such proceeding the Attorney General may file with the clerk of such court a request that a court of three judges be convened to hear and determine the case. Such request by the Attorney General shall be accompanied by a certificate that, in his opinion, the case is of general public importance. A copy of the certificate and request for a three-judge court shall be immediately furnished by such clerk to the chief judge of the circuit (or in his absence, the presiding circuit judge of the circuit) in which the case is pending. Upon receipt of such request it shall be the duty of the chief judge of the circuit or the presiding circuit judge, as the case may be, to designate immediately three judges in such circuit, of whom at least one shall be a circuit judge and another of whom shall be a district judge of the court in which the proceeding was instituted, to hear and determine such case, and it shall be the duty of the judges so designated to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date, to participate in the hearing and determination thereof, and to cause the case to be in every way expedited. An appeal from the final judgment of such court will lie to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn the event the Attorney General fails to file such a request in any such proceeding, it shall be the duty of the chief judge of the district (or in his absence, the acting chief judge) in which the case is pending immediately to designate a judge in such district to hear and determine the case. In the event that no judge in the district is available to hear and determine the case, the chief judge of the district, or the acting chief judge, as the case may be, shall certify this fact to the chief judge of the circuit (or in his absence, the acting chief judge) who shall then designate a district or circuit judge of the circuit to hear and determine the case.\n\nIt shall be the duty of the judge designated pursuant to this section to assign the case for hearing at the earliest practicable date and to cause the case to be in every way expedited.\n\nEFFECT ON STATE LAWS\n\n SEC. 708. Nothing in this title shall be deemed to exempt or relieve any person from any liability, duty, penalty, or punishment provided by any present or future law of any State or political subdivision of a State, other than any such law which purports to require or permit the doing of any act which would be an unlawful employment practice under this title.\n\nINVESTIGATIONS, INSPECTIONS, RECORDS, STATE AGENCIES\n\n SEC. 709. (a) In connection with any investigation of a charge filed under section 706, the Commission or its designated representative shall at all reasonable times have access to, for the purposes of examination, and the right to copy any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by this title and is relevant to the charge under investigation.\n\n(b) The Commission may cooperate with State and local agencies charged with the administration of State fair employment practices laws and, with the consent of such agencies, may for the purpose of carrying out its functions and duties under this title and within the limitation of funds appropriated specifically for such purpose, utilize the services of such agencies and their employees and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may reimburse such agencies and their employees for services rendered to assist the Commission in carrying out this title. In furtherance of such cooperative efforts, the Commission may enter into written agreements with such State or local agencies and such agreements may include provisions under which the Commission shall refrain from processing a charge in any cases or class of cases specified in such agreements and under which no person may bring a civil action under section 706 in any cases or class of cases so specified, or under which the Commission shall relieve any person or class of persons in such State or locality from requirements imposed under this section. The Commission shall rescind any such agreement whenever it determines that the agreement no longer serves the interest of effective enforcement of this title.\n\n(c) Except as provided in subsection (d), every employer, employment agency, and labor organization subject to this title shall (1) make and keep such records relevant to the determinations of whether unlawful employment practices have been or are being committed, (2) preserve such records for such periods, and (3) make such reports therefrom, as the Commission shall prescribe by regulation or order, after public hearing, as reasonable, necessary, or appropriate for the enforcement of this title or the regulations or orders thereunder. The Commission shall, by regulation, require each employer, labor organization, and joint labor-management committee subject to this title which controls an apprenticeship or other training program to maintain such records as are reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this title, including, but not limited to, a list of applicants who wish to participate in such program, including the chronological order in which such applications were received, and shall furnish to the Commission, upon request, a detailed description of the manner in which persons are selected to participate in the apprenticeship or other training program. Any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee which believes that the application to it of any regulation or order issued under this section would result in undue hardship may (1) apply to the Commission for an exemption from the application of such regulation or order, or (2) bring a civil action in the United States district court for the district where such records are kept. If the Commission or the court, as the case may be, finds that the application of the regulation or order to the employer, employment agency, or labor organization in question would impose an undue hardship, the Commission or the court, as the case may be, may grant appropriate relief.\n\n(d) The provisions of subsection (c) shall not apply to any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee with respect to matters occurring in any State or political subdivision thereof which has a fair employment practice law during any period in which such employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee is subject to such law, except that the Commission may require such notations on records which such employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee keeps or is required to keep as are necessary because of differences in coverage or methods of enforcement between the State or local law and the provisions of this title. Where an employer is required by Executive Order 10925, issued March 6, 1961, or by any other Executive order prescribing fair employment practices for Government contractors and subcontractors, or by rules or regulations issued thereunder, to file reports relating to his employment practices with any Federal agency or committee, and he is substantially in compliance with such requirements, the Commission shall not require him to file additional reports pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.\n\n(e) It shall be unlawful for any officer or employee of the Commission to make public in any manner whatever any information obtained by the Commission pursuant to its authority under this section prior to the institution of any proceeding under this title involving such information. Any officer or employee of the Commission who shall make public in any manner whatever any information in violation of this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned not more than one year.\n\nINVESTIGATORY POWERS\n\n SEC. 710.

The time allowed for compliance with the demand in whole or in part as deemed proper and ordered by the court shall not run during the pendency of such petition in the court. Such petition shall specify each ground upon which the petitioner relies in seeking such relief, and may be based upon any failure of such demand to comply with the provisions of this title or with the limitations generally applicable to compulsory process or upon any constitutional or other legal right or privilege of such person. No objection which is not raised by such a petition may be urged in the defense to a proceeding initiated by the Commission under subsection (b) for enforcement of such a demand unless such proceeding is commenced by the Commission prior to the expiration of the twenty-day period, or unless the court determines that the defendant could not reasonably have been aware of the availability of such ground of objection.\n\n(d) In any proceeding brought by the Commission under subsection (b), except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the defendant may petition the court for an order modifying or setting aside the demand of the Commission.\n\nSEC. 711.

The Service may offer its services in cases of such disputes, disagreements, or difficulties whenever, in its judgment, peaceful relations among the citizens of the community involved are threatened thereby, and it may offer its services either upon its own motion or upon the request of an appropriate State or local official or other interested person.\n\nSEC. 1003. (a) The Service shall, whenever possible, in performing its functions, seek and utilize the cooperation of appropriate State or local, public, or private agencies.\n\n(b) The activities of all officers and employees of the Service in providing conciliation assistance shall be conducted in confidence and without publicity, and the Service shall hold confidential any information acquired in the regular performance of its duties upon the understanding that it would be so held.

No person shall be convicted of criminal contempt hereunder unless the act or omission constituting such contempt shall have been intentional, as required in other cases of criminal contempt.\n\nNor shall anything herein be construed to deprive courts of their power, by civil contempt proceedings, without a jury, to secure compliance with or to prevent obstruction of, as distinguished from punishment for violations of, any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command of the court in accordance with the prevailing usages of law and equity, including the power of detention.\n\nSEC. 1102. No person should be put twice in jeopardy under the laws of the United States for the same act or omission. For this reason, an acquittal or conviction in a prosecution for a specific crime under the laws of the United States shall bar a proceeding for criminal contempt, which is based upon the same act or omission and which arises under the provisions of this Act; and an acquittal or conviction in a proceeding for criminal contempt, which arises under the provisions of this Act, shall bar a prosecution for a specific crime under the laws of the United States based upon the same act or omission.\n\nSEC. 1103. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to deny, impair, or otherwise affect any right or authority of the Attorney General or of the United States or any agency or officer thereof under existing law to institute or intervene in any action or proceeding.\n\nSEC. 1104.

There are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 1106. If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and the application of the provision to other persons not similarly situated or to other circumstances shall not be affected thereby."}

Western Urbanism in Czechoslovak Architectural Press (1945 – 1960) \n\nOsmosis or Propaganda? Western Urbanism in Czechoslovak Architectural Press (1945 – 1960)\n\nSummary/Abstract: The article investigates the representation of Western (West-European and Amer¬ican) urban planning in the professional architectural press in Czechoslovakia during the turbulent period of the early years of the communist regime in 1945 – 1960. Focusing on media discourse, the study discusses the transfer of architectural and urban design concepts within postwar Europe and ques¬tions the assumption of the dominant position of Soviet ideology in urban planning and the degree of isolation of Czechoslovak urbanism. Investigating the concepts of publishing architecture, propaganda, and Soviet perception of internationalization, this analysis studies the osmotic access of Western influences through the semipermeable membrane of the Czechoslovak architectural press.

This is exactly the opposite to José who becomes desperate and loses the fight with himself due to his selfishness and narrow-minded perception of love.\" \n\n\n\nJiří Pokorný\n\nThe sensual and passionate ballet is choreographed by the Czech choreographer Jiří Pokorný, who comes back to Ostrava after four years. In 2018, Jiří prepared the choreography Humpback Runner, which he transposed from the Dutch company NDT2 and which formed a part of the production Rising and Falling.\n\nCreators of the \"Ostrava conception\" proceed from the original opera libretto by Henri Meilhac a Ludovic Halévy that is based on the novella of the same name by Prosper Mérimée. As far as the music is concerned, they found inspiration in various versions of Shchedrin's ballet suits, well-known movies, and scenic interpretations (e.g., by Carlos Saura and Mats Ek). Same as in any other previous version, Carmen, José, and Micaele, who is given the name Lady M in this ballet, are essential in the story. Sunny 19th-century Spanish Sevilla is replaced by a night club of the contemporary industrial city, but the dramatic tension is not lost, quite the opposite...\n\nUsing of the music with the permission of Boosey & Hawkes Music Publishers Limited on behalf of Musikverlag Hans Sikorski GmbH."}

(Czech pronunciation: [ˈʃkoda] ⓘ), often shortened to Škoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer established in 1925 as the successor to Laurin & Klement and headquartered in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic. Škoda Works became state owned in 1948. After 1991, it was gradually privatized to the German multinational conglomerate Volkswagen Group, becoming a partial subsidiary in 1994 and a wholly owned subsidiary in 2000.[4][5]\n\nŠkoda automobiles are sold in over 100 countries, and in 2018, total global sales reached 1.25 million units, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year.[6] The operating profit was €1.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 34.6% over the previous year.[7][8] As of 2017, Škoda's profit margin was the second-highest of all Volkswagen AG brands after Porsche.[9]\n\nThe Škoda Works was founded by Czech engineer Emil von Škoda in 1859 in Plzeň, then in the Kingdom of Bohemia, Austrian Empire, and was originally an arms manufacturer. It was one of the largest European industrial conglomerates in the 20th century, and is the predecessor of today's Škoda Auto, Doosan Škoda Power and Škoda Transportation companies. Although Škoda is named after its founder, the word \"škoda\" also means \"pity\" or \"shame\" in Czech.[10][11]\n\nAs with many long-established car manufacturers, the company that became Škoda Auto started by manufacturing bicycles.[12] Škoda (then Laurin & Klement) was founded in 1896 as a velocipede manufacturer.[13]\n\nIn 1894 (131 years ago) ( ), 26-year-old Václav Klement (1868–1938), who was a bookseller in Mladá Boleslav, Kingdom of Bohemia (today's Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary), was unable to obtain spare parts to repair his German bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the manufacturers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter, in Czech, asking them to carry out repairs, only to receive a reply, in German, stating: \"If you want us to answer you, we insist that you convey your message in a language we understand.\"[14] Not satisfied with the reply and realising the business potential, Klement, despite having no technical experience, decided to start a bicycle repair shop, which he and Václav Laurin opened in 1896 in Mladá Boleslav. Before going into partnership with Klement, Laurin had been an established bicycle manufacturer in the nearby town of Turnov.[15]\n\nIn 1898, after moving to their newly built factory, the pair bought a Werner \"Motocyclette\".[nb 1] Laurin & Klement's first motorcyclette, powered by an engine mounted on the handlebars driving the front wheels, proved dangerous and unreliable – an early accident on it cost Laurin a front tooth. To design a safer machine with its structure around the engine, the pair wrote to German ignition specialist Robert Bosch for advice on a different electromagnetic system.[citation needed]\n\nTheir new Slavia motorcycle made its debut in 1899, and the company became the first motorcycle factory in Central Europe.[13] In 1900, with a company workforce of 32, Slavia exports began and 150 machines were shipped to London for the Hewtson firm. Shortly afterwards, the press credited them as makers of the first motorcycle.[16][17]\n\nBy 1905, the firm was manufacturing automobiles, making it the second-oldest car manufacturer in the Czech lands after Tatra. The company, with an area of 7,800 square metres (0.78 ha), had a workforce of 320 and used 170 special machine tools, power-driven by 100 horsepower (75 kW) of steam power.[13] The first model, Voiturette A, was a success, and the company was established both within Austria-Hungary and internationally.[18]\n\nAfter World War I, the Laurin & Klement company began producing trucks, but in 1924, after running into problems and being affected by a fire on their premises, the company sought a new partner.\n\nMeanwhile, Akciová společnost, dříve Škodovy závody (Limited Company, formerly the Škoda Works), an arms manufacturer and multisector concern in Plzeň, which had become one of the largest industrial enterprises in Europe and the largest in Czechoslovakia, sought to enlarge its nonarms-manufacturing base, so acquired Laurin & Klement in 1925. It also started manufacturing cars in cooperation with Hispano-Suiza. Most of the later production took place under Škoda's name.\n\nAn assembly line was used for production from 1930 onwards. In the same year, a formal spin-off of the car manufacture into a new company, Akciová společnost pro automobilový průmysl or abbreviated ASAP, took place. ASAP remained a wholly owned subsidiary of the Škoda Works, and continued to sell cars under the Škoda marque. Apart from the factory in Mladá Boleslav, it included also the firm's representation, sales offices, and services, as well as a central workshop in Prague. At the time, the car factory in Mladá Boleslav covered an area of 215,000 m2 and employed 3,750 blue-collar and 500 white-collar workers.\n\nIn 1932 ASAP-Škoda in Mladá Boleslav Bohemia produced a type Škoda 932 prototype of a streamlined 4-seater two-door car with a rear air-cooled flat-four engine designed by Karel Hrdlička and Vsevold Korolkov. This car's bodywork closely resembled the small car designs yet to come.[19]\n\nAfter a decline caused by the economic depression, Škoda introduced a new line of cars in the 1930s, which significantly differed from its previous products. A new design of chassis with backbone tube and all-around independent suspension was developed under the leadership of chief engineer Vladimír Matouš and modelled on the one first introduced by Hans Ledwinka in Tatra. First used on model Škoda 420 Standard in 1933, it aimed at solving insufficient torsional stiffness of the ladder frame.[20]\n\nThe new design of chassis became the basis for models Popular (845–1,089 cc), Rapid (1,165–1,766 cc), Favorit (1,802–2,091 cc), and Superb (2,492–3,991 cc).[20] While in 1933 Škoda had a 14% share of the Czechoslovak car market and occupied third place behind Praga and Tatra, the new line made it a market leader by 1936, with a 39% share in 1938.[20]\n\nDuring the occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, the Škoda Works were turned into part of the Reichswerke Hermann Göring serving the Nazi German war effort by producing components for military terrain vehicles, military planes, other weapons components and cartridge cases. Vehicle output decreased from 7,052 in 1939 to 683 in 1944, of which only 35 were passenger cars. Between January and May 1945, 316 trucks were produced.[21] The UK and US air forces bombed the Škoda works repeatedly between 1940 and 1945. The final massive air raid took place on 25 April 1945, and resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Škoda armament works and about 1,000 dead or injured.[22]\n\nWhen, by July 1945, the Mladá Boleslav factory had been reconstructed, production of Škoda's first post-World War II car, the 1101 series, began. It was essentially an updated version of the pre-World War II Škoda Popular. In the autumn of 1948, Škoda (along with all other large manufacturers) became part of the communist planned economy, which meant it was separated from the parent company, Škoda Works. In spite of unfavourable political conditions and losing contact with technical development in noncommunist countries, Škoda retained a good reputation until the 1960s, producing models such as the Škoda 440 Spartak, 445 Octavia, Felicia, and Škoda 1000 MB.[23]\n\nStarting in 1957, the Škoda Octavia, and later the Felicia, were imported to the United States amid a wave of new imports as some American consumers sought out cars smaller than typical Detroit offerings.[24] Škoda’s American dealerships, concentrated on the West Coast and in the Northeast, quickly encountered buyer resistance due to the Cold War political climate in ways that comparable Western European cars did not. The cars were also not well supported after sale, making even minor repairs a hassle. U.S. sales peaked in 1959 but fell sharply after 1960, and many were sold at steep discounts. A few later cars, including 1000MB models, were sold in the U.S. as late as 1966-67, but in very small numbers.[24] Škoda has not sold vehicles in the U.S. since then but did sell cars in Canada from 1984 to 1990.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Škoda (then named Automobilové závody, národní podnik or abbreviated AZNP) was still manufacturing cars that conceptually dated back to the 1960s, and in Western Europe at least - were aimed squarely at the budget end of the market. Rear-engined models such as the Škoda 105/120 (Estelle) and Rapid sold steadily and performed well against more modern makes in races such as the RAC Rally in the 1970s and 1980s. They won their class in the RAC rally for 17 years running. They were powered by a 130 PS (96 kW), 1,289 cc (78.7 cu in) engine. In spite of its dated image and becoming the subject of negative jokes – What do you call a Škoda with a sunroof? A skip! – Škodas remained a common sight on the roads of the United Kingdom and Western Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s.[25]\n\nSport versions of the Estelle and earlier models were produced, using the name \"Rapid\" (originally sold as the Garde in some markets). Soft-top versions were also available. The Rapid was once described as the \"poor man's Porsche\",[26] and had significant sales success in the UK during the 1980s.[25]\n\nIn 1987, the Favorit was introduced, and was one of a trio of compact front-wheel drive hatchbacks from the three main Eastern Bloc manufacturers around that time, the others being VAZ's Lada Samara and Zastava's Yugo Sana. The Favorit's appearance was the work of Italian design company Bertone. With some motor technology licensed from western Europe, but still using the Škoda-designed 1289 cc engine, Škoda engineers designed a car comparable to western production. The technological gap still existed, but began closing rapidly. The Favorit was very popular in Czechoslovakia and other Eastern Bloc countries. It also sold well in Western Europe, especially in the UK and Denmark due to its low price, and was regarded as solid and reliable. However, it was perceived as having poor value compared with contemporary Western European designs. The Favorit's trim levels were improved, and it continued to be sold until the introduction of the Felicia in 1994.\n\nUntil 1990, Škoda was still making its outdated range of rear-engined small family cars, although it had started production of the Favorit front-wheel drive hatchback in 1987 as an eventual replacement.\n\nThe fall of communism with the Velvet Revolution brought great changes to Czechoslovakia, and most industries were subject to privatization. In the case of Škoda Automobile, the state authorities brought in a strong foreign partner. The tender for privatization was announced in 1990; 24 different companies were registered for the tender, while only eight of them expressed a serious interest – BMW, GM, Renault, Volvo, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat, and Mercedes-Benz. In August 1990, VW and Renault were on the shortlist.[5]\n\nRenault first offered to terminate Favorit production and replace it with the outdated Renault 18 derivative and new Renault Twingo, which would have eliminated the Škoda brand. This offer was declined and Renault prepared a new one. They offered a 60:40 joint venture (40% share of Renault), while Škoda Favorit production was to be retained and produced side by side with the Renault 19, and producing engine units, gearboxes, and other components for Renault. Total investment would have been US$2.6 billion (US$6 billion in 2019).[5]\n\nVolkswagen offered to continue Favorit production and preserve the Škoda brand, including retention of research and development. Volkswagen offered a purchase of 30% Škoda share, gradually increasing to 70%. Volkswagen's total investment would have been US$6.6 billion (US$15 billion in 2019) by 2000. The government inclined on the Renault side, while the Škoda trade union preferred VW, because it offered significantly larger potential for development of the company.[5]\n\nVolkswagen was chosen by the Czech government on 9 December 1990,[27] and as a result, on 28 March 1991 a joint-venture partnership agreement with Volkswagen took place, marked by the transfer of a 30% share to the Volkswagen Group on 16 April 1991, raised later on 19 December 1994 to 60.3% and the year after, on 11 December 1995, to 70% of its shares, with the aim of making VW the largest and controlling shareholder of Škoda.[28] On 30 May 2000, Volkswagen AG bought the remaining 30% of the company, thus making Škoda Auto a wholly owned subsidiary of the group.\n\nBacked by Volkswagen Group expertise and investments, the design – both style and engineering – has improved greatly. The 1994 model Felicia was effectively a reskin of the Favorit, but quality and equipment improvements helped, and in the Czech Republic, the car was perceived as good value for money and became popular. Sales improved across Europe,[5] including the United Kingdom, where the Felicia was one of the highest-ranking cars in customer satisfaction surveys.\n\nVolkswagen AG chairman Ferdinand Piëch personally chose Dirk van Braeckel as head of design, and the subsequent Octavia and Fabia models made their way to the demanding European Union markets. They are built on common Volkswagen Group floorpans. The Fabia, launched at the end of 1999, formed the basis for later versions of the Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza, while the Octavia, launched in 1996, has shared its floorpan with a host of cars, the most popular of which is the Volkswagen Golf Mk4.\n\nThe perception of Škoda in Western Europe has completely changed since the takeover by VW,[29] in stark comparison with the reputation of the cars throughout the 1980s described by some as \"the laughing stock\" of the automotive world.[30][31] As technical development progressed and attractive new models were marketed, Škoda's image was initially slow to improve. In the UK, a major change was achieved with the ironic \"It is a Škoda, honest\" campaign, which began in 2000 when the Fabia launched. In a 2003 advertisement on British television, a new employee on the production line is fitting Škoda badges on the car bonnets. When some attractive-looking cars come along, he stands back, not fitting the badge, since they look so good they \"cannot be Škodas\".[32] This market campaign worked by confronting Škoda's image problem head-on – a tactic which marketing professionals regarded as high risk. By 2005, Škoda was selling over 30,000 cars a year in the UK, a market share over 1%. For the first time in its UK history, a waiting list developed for deliveries from Škoda. UK owners have consistently ranked the brand at or near the top of customer-satisfaction surveys since the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1991, Škoda built 172,000 units, exporting 26% of its production to 30 countries, while in 2000, it built 435,000 units, exporting 82% of its production to 72 countries.[33]\n\nOne of the most important years for Škoda Auto was 2010, in terms of both products and management. On 1 September 2010, Prof. Dr. H.C. Winfried Vahland assumed responsibility for the management of the company, becoming the CEO of Škoda Auto. In the same year, Škoda set forth plans to double the company's annual sales to at least 1.5 million by 2018 (later known as the 'Growth Strategy', Czech: Růstová strategie).[34]\n\nAt the 2010 Paris Motor Show in September 2010, the company unveiled the Octavia Green E Line. This e-car concept was the forerunner to the e-car test fleet that Škoda released in 2012. The final first-generation Octavia (Tour) was produced at the Mladá Boleslav plant in November 2010. The worldwide production of this model exceeded 1.4 million units since its release in 1996. In 2010 for the first time in history, China overtook German sales to become Škoda's largest individual market.[35]\n\nIn 2011, Škoda Auto celebrated its 20-year partnership with the Volkswagen Group. More than 75,000 visitors attended an open-house event held in Mladá Boleslav in the April. Earlier that year, the company provided details on its 2018 Growth Strategy: for at least one new or completely revised model to be released every six months.[36][37] With this in mind, the company redesigned its logo and CI, which was presented at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. Škoda's main attraction at the event was the VisionD design concept, a forerunner to the future third-generation Octavia. Škoda presented the MissionL design study at the IAA in Frankfurt am Main in September, which was to become the basis of the company's forthcoming compact model the European Rapid.\n\nIn the same year, the company started production of the new Rapid model in Pune, India (October 2011), and launched the Škoda Citigo at Volkswagen's Bratislava plant (November 2011).\n\nIn 2012, Škoda introduced two new mass production models. The European version of the Rapid premiered at the Paris Motor Show. This car was a successor to the first-generation Octavia in terms of its price bracket. The second model was the third-generation Octavia, which premiered in December 2012. In the same month, local production of the Yeti was launched at the Nizhny Novgorod GAZ factory.[38]\n\nIn 2012, Škoda, introduced an emission-free (on the street) fleet of Octavia Green E Line e-cars on Czech roads to be used by external partners. Since internal tests on the fleet in late 2011, the e-fleet had driven more than 250,000 km. During the same year, Škoda celebrated several milestones, including 14 million Škoda cars being produced since 1905 (January),[39] three million Fabias (May),[40] 500,000 Superbs at the Kvasiny plant (June),[41] and 5 years of Škoda operations in China.[38]\n\nMassive rejuvenation of the model range was a major tune for 2013 at Škoda: The Czech car maker launched the third-generation Octavia Combi and Octavia RS (both liftback and estate), as well as facelifted Superb and Superb Combi. They were accompanied by brand new members of the Rapid family as the Rapid Spaceback, the first Škoda hatchback car in the compact segment, and the Chinese version of the Rapid. The Yeti also faced significant changes. With the facelift, two design variants of Škoda's compact SUV are now available, the city-likeoriented Yeti and rugged Yeti Outdoor. Chinese customers were also given a Yeti with an extended wheelbase.\n\nIn 2015, Volkswagen admitted that it had installed pollution-cheating software in many of its cars to fool regulators that its cars met emissions standards, when in fact they polluted at much higher levels than government standards. About 1.2 million Škoda cars worldwide were fitted with this emissions-cheating device.[42] Škoda stated that Volkswagen would recall and cover refitting costs for all of the cars affected by the scandal.\n\nIn 2015, Škoda was voted the most reliable car brand in the UK.[43] A corporate strategy was launched in 2015 to produce a range of all-electric cars from 2019.[44]\n\nŠkoda Auto started to manufacture the large, seven-seat SUV Škoda Kodiaq in 2016,[45] it was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 2016,[46] and sales began at early 2017. In the second half of 2017, sales began of the new compact SUV Škoda Karoq, which officially replaced the Škoda Yeti. The automaker introduced in December 2018 a new small family car, the Škoda Scala. In February 2019, the company introduced in Geneva the new subcompact crossover Škoda Kamiq.\n\nIn 2015, new Škoda chairman Bernhard Maier stated that the Volkswagen Group \"is working on a modular, new electric platform and we are in the team\", and \"there is no alternative to electrification.\"[44] New Škoda corporate \"Strategy 2025\", which replaces the previous \"Strategy 2018\", aims to start production of a fully electric vehicle in 2020,[44] and five electric models across different segments by 2025.[47]\n\nAt Auto Shanghai in 2017, Škoda displayed its Vision E concept for an all-electric 300-bhp coupé-SUV,[48] with level 3 autonomy capability and 500 kilometres (310 mi) range.[49] It is based on the VW MEB platform and Škoda Auto will also manufacture electric-vehicle batteries for the Volkswagen Group in its facility in the Czech Republic.[50] The second development stage, the Škoda Vision iV, was revealed in March 2019.\n\nA plug-in hybrid car, the Škoda Superb iV, was available for sale from early 2020,[51] and a small SUV model Škoda Kamiq with a natural gas-electric hybrid powertrain and a hybrid Fabia from later the same year.[44][52][53] By March 2018, the electrification plan was expanded to 10 electrified models for 2025 - six fully electric cars and four plugin-hybrids. Out of these, five models are to be available by 2020.[54] In 2018, the brand launched its largest-ever investment plan of €2 billion over five years into its electrification.[55]\n\nThe brand's first fully electric car, a city car Škoda Citigo-e iV, was sold from 2019 to 2020.[56][57] The all-electric Škoda Enyaq iV is available for sale since September 2020. Škoda Enyaq Coupé is sold from May 2023.\n\nŠkoda has maintained sound financial stability over recent years. In 2013, the brand achieved sales revenues totalling €10.3 billion (2012: €10.4 billion). Due to the weak economic situation in many European countries and the expansion of the model range, operating profit reached a modest €522 million (2012: €712 million). Škoda achieved a successful start to 2014. As well as recording the highest number of deliveries to customers in a first quarter ever (247,200; up 12.1%), it recorded a significant increase in sales revenue (23.7%) to almost €3 billion. Operating profit increased 65.2% to €185 million over the previous year.\n\nAs of August 2016, Škoda was being sold in 102 countries.[68] In 2022, the top markets for Škoda by number of sales were Germany (134,260), Czech Republic (71,152), India (51,865), Great Britain (49,555) and Poland (44,985).[66] In the Asia-Pacific region, Škoda is also being sold in Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Brunei. Škoda is also planning to expand into Iran, where imports are to be started from 2018 and production of vehicles by 2020.[69] Expansion strategy also includes Singapore.[70]\n\nŠkoda cars are now made in factories in the Czech Republic (635,213 cars), India (55,750 cars), China (41,936 cars) and Slovakia (16,116 cars).[66] A smaller number of Škoda models are additionally manufactured in Solomonovo, Ukraine through local partner. Until 2020 there was manufacturing in Öskemen, Kazakhstan. Cars were also built in two locations in Russia, however this ended following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.[71] The following table lists the factories and their production models in 2019.[72][73]\n\nThe Škoda brand has been engaged in motor sport since 1901, and has gained a number of titles with various vehicles around the world. The team had competed as a manufacturer in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (before it merged with ERC in 2013) and World Rally Championship between 1999 and 2005. Now it competes in the European Rally Championship and WRC-2.\n\nUntil the final season of IRC in 2012, Škoda Motorsport was the most successful manufacturer with a total of 27 points, winning the rallying series in 2010–2012. Since 2013, When the two competing series were merged, it continued to compete in the European Rally Championship.\n\nŠkoda Motorsport drivers won with the Škoda Fabia S2000 the European Rally Championships in 2012–2014.\n\nFollowing a long history of class victories in lower levels of motorsport, Škoda became a participant in the FIA World Rally Championship in the 1999 season, with World Rally Car models of the Škoda Octavia. Škoda's best result with the Octavia WRC was Armin Schwarz's third place at the 2001 Safari Rally. From mid 2003, the Octavia was replaced by the smaller Škoda Fabia. Škoda used the 2004 season to develop the car further, but did not achieve much success the following season. However, at the season-ending Rally Australia, 1995 world champion Colin McRae was running second before retiring. Škoda then withdrew from the series, and the 2006 season saw Škoda represented by the semi-privateer Red Bull Škoda Team. Jan Kopecký drove the Fabia WRC to fifth place at the Rally Catalunya, and as late as the 2007 Rallye Deutschland the Fabia still achieved a fifth-place result, again in the hands of Kopecký. Former works Ford and Citroen driver François Duval also drove a Fabia WRC in 2006 for the privateer First Motorsport team, achieving a sixth-place finish in Catalunya.\n\nIn 2009, Škoda entered the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) for the first time, using the Fabia S2000, winning three rallies and finishing second in both the drivers and manufacturers championship. In 2010, Škoda won a total of seven IRC events winning both the manufacturers and driver championship for Juho Hänninen. These achievements were repeated in the following two seasons, with Andreas Mikkelsen as the drivers' champion. In 2013, the Intercontinental Rally Challenge was merged with the European Rally Championship (ERC) and the team gained the drivers' championship title once again for Jan Kopecký. The car was also raced by privateers in several championships, including Red Bull, Barwa, Rene Georges and Rufa in the 2010 Super 2000 World Rally Championship.\n\nŠkoda Motorsport won the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 WRC-2 championships with Škoda Fabia R5.\n\nIn August 2011, a special Škoda Octavia vRS set a world record at the Bonneville Speedway and became the fastest production car in the world with an engine up to two litres, when it hit 227 mph (365 km/h).[76] The current fastest production Škoda car is the Škoda Superb III, with a top speed of 250 km/h (160 mph) and an acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.8 seconds.\n\nIn 1923, two different trademarks were registered at the Office for Innovation and Model Registration in Plzeň. The first depicted a winged arrow pointing to the right with five feathers in a circle and the second was a winged arrow with three feathers. The famous winged arrow with three feathers still forms the Škoda logo today. The ŠKODA text was added to the logo in 1936. The arrow represents speed, the wings progress and freedom, the eye precision and the circle unity, completeness, world and harmony.[77][78] The story goes that, on his travels through the US, Emil Škoda had once been so taken with a Native American's feathered headdress that he had returned to Plzeň with a relief image which inspired the logo.[79]\n• List of automobile manufacturers of the Czech RepublicŠkoda UK | The Official Škoda Website: Get up and go with our electrifying new compact SUV"}

It rises 327 m above sea level and some 130 m above the left bank of the Vltava River. The hill, almost entirely covered with parks, is a favorite recreational area for the inhabitants of Prague.[1] The hill (in German known as Laurenziberg) is featured prominently in Franz Kafka's early short story \"Description of a Struggle\" and briefly in Milan Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being.[2]\n\nThe chronicler Cosmas describes Petřín as a very rocky place, the hill is allegedly called Petřín because of the large number of rocks (Latin: petra).[3] Since ancient times, stones were dug and were used to construct buildings in Prague. Medieval defence wall, the Hunger Wall was built on Petřín Hill during 1360 - 1362, by the order of king of Bohemia Charles IV. The Petřín Lookout Tower, which strongly resembles the Eiffel Tower, was built atop a hill in 1891. Other sights include the Rose Garden, Mirror Maze, Cathedral of Saint Lawrence, and St Michael Church.\n\nThe summit of the hill is linked to Prague's Malá Strana district by the Petřín funicular, a funicular railway that first operated in 1891.\n• St. Michael the Archangel Church (wooden church from the second half of the 17th century in Boyko style, transferred from Subcarpathian Ruthenia in 1929) 4\n• Memorial to the Victims of CommunismPetřín Tower & Hill in Prague | Visitor Information & History: 1. Travel by tram to tram stop Ujezd (trams 9,12,15,20,22,23). Then, take the Petřín Funicular (closed until 2026).\n\n\n\n2. Travel by metro to metro stop Malostranska (line A), then by tram to tram stop Pohorelec (tram 22,23,25). Then walk 10 minutes via Strahovska street. \n\n\n\n3. Travel by minibus 194 to Nemocnice pod Petřínem bus stop, then walk 10 minutes via Vlasska street. Petřín Hill is an area of park and woodland in the Lesser Town in Prague, and makes for a fine half-day excursion out of the historical city centre. Looking up from the river, Petřín is the hill to the left of Prague Castle. At the summit of Petřín hill are several visitor attractions set in landscaped gardens. The most striking is Petřín Tower (Petřínské rozhledna). Built in 1891 for the Jubilee Exhibition, the steel-framework Petřín observation tower was conceived as a mini version of the Eiffel Tower. It is 58.70m high, which doesn't seem particularly tall until you consider that it sits atop Petřín Hill, which is itself 324m above sea level. Climb the 299 steps inside Petřín Tower and the views over Prague are magnificent; on a clear day, you can see the highest peak in Czechia, Snezka, 150km away. The extensive gardens surrounding Petřín Tower (which include a beautiful rose garden) are a calm and engaging oasis to stroll around, whether in the summer sunshine or the snows of winter. The only weather to avoid is rain and fog as the area is quite exposed. The views over Prague from the summit of Petřín are terrific, even without climbing the tower. OTHER ATTRACTIONS on Petřín Hill: \n\n\n\n-tefánik Observatory (tefánikova hvězdárna): Visitors can see inside the telescope domes, and through a large telescope, observe the sun, moon, planets and stars. A small astronomical museum explains the basics of astronomy. \n\n\n\n-Mirror Maze. \n\n\n\n-Church of St. Lawrence. \n\n\n\n-The Cavern (small mystical building). \n\n\n\n-Children's playground. \n\n\n\n-Carousel (open in the summer months). \n\n\n\n-Cafés & refreshment stands. It is free to walk around the Petřín Hill landscapped gardens. Minor entrance fees apply for the visitor attractions. There is no need to pre-book. \n\n\n\nThe mighty Hunger Wall (Hladová zed) runs down one side of Petřín Hill. Commissioned by Emperor Charles IV in 1360-1362, it forms part of the city's medieval fortifications. The name derives from the reason the wall was built: to provide employment for Prague residents during hard times. The stone used to construct many historical buildings in Prague was quarried out of Petřín. All evidence of this mining activity is hidden beneath the park and woodland covering the hill. After visiting the summit, instead of taking public transport, an alternative way to return to the historical centre is to walk down the hill. A series of pathways leads the way through the trees. For refreshments on your descent, a local restaurant, Nebozizek, and a Czech pub, Petřínské Terasy, are set on the side of Petřín Hill, halfway down. Both have large terraces and are ideal spots to enjoy a drink or meal with a view. They are accessible on foot or via the Petřín Funicular, which has a stop here in both directions. At the bottom of Petřín Hill is a well-equipped children's playground, near the funicular terminal. From the terminal, it is a 10-minute walk to Charles Bridge. Or you can take a tram to other parts of Prague. For locals, Petřín is somewhere to go for a walk in nature and to take in beautiful views over Prague. For visitors in Prague for a few days, once you have explored the main sights (Prague Castle, Old Town Square, etc.), Petřín Hill could be your next move. \n\n\n\n HOW TO REACH Petřín Tower & Hill Travel options from the historical centre of Prague: 1. A ride on the Petřín Funicular is the easiest, most pleasurable way to reach the summit of Petřín. It departs from Ujezd in the Lesser Town, which is 5 minutes walk from Ujezd tram stop. Unfortunately, the funicular is closed for renovation until 2026. \n\n\n\n 2. Tram 22, 23 or 25 to Pohořelec tram stop, then walk 10 minutes via Strahovska street;\n\n\n\n 3. Minibus 194 to Nemocnice pod Petřínem bus stop, then walk 10 minutes via Vlasska street;\n\n\n\n 4. Walk up Petřín Hill. The climb takes 30 minutes and is steep, but the walk is pleasant, passing through park and woodland;\n\n\n\n 5. Take a taxi.\n\n\n\n TOURIST INFORMATION CENTRE A Prague Tourist Information Centre is sited at the base of Petřín Tower.

His works can be seen in different locations around Prague as well as in his own, Prague-based museum, called Musoleum.\n\nČerný was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia. From 1988 to 1994, he studied at the Kurt Gebauer Studio at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, and in 1995 and 1996, he participated in the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program in New York, US. In 1994–1995, he took the PSI artists residence in New York, and in 1996, he received a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant. In 1991, he took a residency of the Swiss government in Boswil.[1]\n\nČerný gained notoriety in 1991 by painting pink a Soviet tank that served as a war memorial in central Prague.[2] His act of civil disobedience was considered vandalism, and he was briefly arrested. Another of Černý's conspicuous contributions to Prague is Tower Babies (2000), a series of cast figures of crawling infants attached to Žižkov Television Tower.[3]\n\nIn 2005 Černý created Shark, an image of Saddam Hussein in a tank of formaldehyde; the piece was presented at the second Prague Biennale that same year. Shark is a direct parody of the 1991 work The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living by Damien Hirst. In 2006 the piece was banned in Middelkerke, Belgium; in Bielsko-Biała, Poland; and also in the German town of Büdelsdorf.[4][5] The mayor of Middelkerke, Michel Landuyt, admitted that he was worried that the exhibit could \"shock people, including Muslims\" in a year already marred by tensions associated with Danish cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed.[6]\n\nThe deputy mayor of Bielsko-Biała, Zbigniew Michniowski, contacted the city-funded gallery, galeria BWA, on 9 September 2006, and threatened dire consequences if the artwork was not removed promptly.[citation needed] In response, Shark was transported to the Szara Gallery, in the nearby town of Cieszyn. Its mayor, Bogdan Ficek, distanced himself from Bielsko-Biała's position, saying, \"I cannot see any reason a politician should censor art\".[7]\n\nČerný's statue METALmorphosis is on display in Charlotte, North Carolina.[8] He created a similar outdoor sculpture in 2014, in Prague, called Head of Franz Kafka.\n\nHis Entropa, presented to mark the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union during the first half of 2009, attracted controversy both for its stereotyped depictions of the various EU member states, and because it turned out to have been created by Černý and two friends rather than, as promised, being a collaboration between artists from each of the member states.[9][10] Some EU member states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country. For instance, Bulgaria decided to summon the Czech ambassador to Sofia in order to discuss the illustration of the Balkan country as a collection of squat toilets.[11] Meanwhile, the Bulgarian permanent representative to the EU allegedly said, \"It is a humiliation for the Bulgarian nation and an offense to our national dignity.” \"[12]\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics, Černý created London Booster—a double-decker bus with mechanical arms for doing push-ups.[13]\n\nIn April 2023, Černý opened his own gallery space, called Musoleum, in Prague's Smíchov district.[14]\n• Statue of Sigmund Freud hanging by one hand\n• London Booster in front of Czech House in London in front of Czech House in LondonDavid Cerny: \"It is an honor for the Tijuana Cultural Center to be that instance of the Ministry of Culture of the Federal...Blog Post: David Černý: Rebellion | Crocker Art Museum: Street artist, engineer, architect, pilot, rebel, and provocateur are all words used to describe Czech artist David Černý, but the terms most akin to his nature are innovator and disruptor. Černý is widely recognized for his monumental sculptures in public spaces, which speak directly to everyday people and protest authority through satire and derision. All his works have a personal connection to the history of his country—the Czech Republic—and Europe broadly in the post-World War II era. His political views (anti-authoritarian, anti-Communist, and anti-censorship) are a product of his journey as a contemporary artist during a time when regressive ideologies have returned, wars continue to be waged, and societies are dehumanized by governments and economics.\n\nBorn in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1967, Černý grew up in an artistic family, his father being a painter, his mother an art restorer. His childhood was filled with going to art openings and museums. And yet, Černý has long rejected the idea of being an “artist,” embracing instead a path more akin to that of his grandfather, who was an inventor and officer in the army. Sharing his grandfather’s love of engineering, Černý was fascinated by how things worked, from building model airplanes to deconstructing toy trains. In high school, he studied theater and film and was accepted to the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, where he studied industrial design. Today, these skills allow him to create work that is as distinguished for its craftsmanship as for the adventurous themes he addresses.\n\nThe lingering effects of the 1968 Soviet invasion of his homeland ignited Černý’s impulse to rebel against a Communist government that repressed freedom of expression. This came to a head in May 1991, when the artist was arrested for painting a Soviet tank pink, transforming what was a war memorial honoring the 1945 liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army into a giant pink “toy” that mocked Soviet oppressors. In 1996, he created Man Hanging Out, a depiction of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud hanging by one hand from a pole high above the ground. The uncomfortable piece was meant to question the role that intellectualism might play in the new millennium, while at the same time interpreting the hopelessness of modern times. King Wenceslas, a sculpture a king riding an upside-down horse, was unveiled at the Lucerna Palace in Prague in 1999. Protesting the ineptness of post-Cold War governments, Černý showed the king aiming to look heroic atop an expired mount, conveying his idea of a government in which, as he says, “Nothing works . . . but we all pretend it does.”\n\nIn the Crocker’s exhibition, the power of Černý’s political satire will be abundantly clear. Tower Babies [fig. 1] is a group of crawling infants made of fiberglass and steel that were installed in 2000 on the exterior of Prague's Žižkov Television Tower as part of the European Capital Culture year. They communicate the artist’s concern for the dehumanization of society, as he has replaced their faces with barcodes. Reflecting both the past and present, the barcodes reference the numbered tattoos forced upon Holocaust victims by the Nazis, the rise of the far-right in many countries, consumerism, and tattoos sported by many people today.\n\nIn 2013, Černý established himself as a true provocateur through his work Finger [fig. 3], a version of which is included in the exhibition. On the eve of the Czech general elections, he placed a 30-foot middle finger on a barge in the Vltava River in front of the presidential palace, an in-your-face message to President Miloš Zeman, a Communist sympathizer. “This finger is aimed straight at the castle politics,” Černý explains. “After 23 years, I am horrified at the prospect of the Communists returning to power and of Mr. Zeman helping them to do so.”\n\nČerný’s resin and LED wall sculpture Albert Einstein [cover] depicts one of the world’s most renowned scientists and thinkers. In his portrait, Černý showcases gears, cogs, bones, and other items that denote the inner workings of brilliance within the seemingly translucent makeup of Einstein’s playful face. In creating this homage to a genius, Černý uses a proprietary technique in which three-dimensional objects float within a polymer resin as if seen via X-ray. What results is both solid and translucent, a process that Černý applied to other intellectuals, including Nikola Tesla and J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose visages are also included in the show, as well as to a human skull [fig. 4].\n\nOne of Černý’s most recent sculptures, Cock [fig. 5], is a monumental combination of a rooster and gun, an ode to masculine potency atop bird legs. The sculpture’s title can be interpreted three ways: the action one takes before\n\npulling a gun’s trigger, the male anatomy, and poultry, all of which are integrated into this symbol of dominance, power, and destruction. Free thinking, strong-willed, and eccentric, Černý continues to provoke and encourage contemplation in everything he creates, including in a recently unveiled, monumental sculpture entitled Věra for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, a piece honoring the late Czech gymnast and dissident Vera Čáslavská. Whether he is paying homage, assaulting politics, or creating whimsical metaphors of contemporary society, he aims to connect directly with the public, making works that are impossible to ignore, regardless of his target.\n\nThis exhibition was organized by the Centro Cultural Tijuana (CECUT), an institution of the Secretariat of Culture of the Government of Mexico, and made possible by HOHMANN, Inc."}

It flows through the Vysočina and South Moravian regions, including the city of Brno. It is 168.5 km (104.7 mi) long, making it the 9th longest river in the Czech Republic.\n\nAccording to one theory, the name originates from the Proto-Slavic verb vort (vrátit in modern Czech), which meant \"to return\". It denoted \"a returning river\" (which meant meandering river). Another theory is that the name was derived from the Germanic Swarta, which meant \"black water\". Sometimes the river was colloquially referred to as Švarcava or Švorcava.[1]\n\nThe Svratka originates in the territory of Cikháj in the Upper Svratka Highlands at an elevation of 772 m (2,533 ft) and flows to the Nové Mlýny reservoirs, where it enters the Thaya River in Dolní Věstonice at an elevation of 163 m (535 ft). It is 168.5 km (104.7 mi) long, making it the 9th longest river in the Czech Republic. Its drainage basin has an area of 7,115.6 km2 (2,747.3 sq mi).[2]\n\nThe longest tributaries of the Svratka are:[3]\n\nThe most notable settlement on the Svratka is the city of Brno, where the Svitava flows into the river. The river flows past the following municipalities: Cikháj, Herálec, Svratka, Křižánky, Březiny, Krásné, Spělkov, Telecí, Borovnice, Jimramov, Strachujov, Unčín, Dalečín, Chlum-Korouhvice, Vír, Koroužné, Štěpánov nad Svratkou, Ujčov, Nedvědice, Černvír, Doubravník, Borač, Štěpánovice, Tišnov, Veverská Bítýška, Brno, Modřice, Rajhrad, Židlochovice, Nosislav, Velké Němčice, Vranovice, Pouzdřany, Ivaň and Dolní Věstonice.\n\nIn the section from Březiny to Borovnice, the river forms the border between the Vysočina and Pardubice regions. In the section from Herálec to Jimramov, the river also forms the border between the historical lands of Bohemia and Moravia.\n\nThe reservoirs Brno (259 ha (640 acres)), Vír I (224 ha (550 acres)) and Vír II (13 ha (32 acres)) are built on the Svratka. The largest body of water in the basin area is the Dalešice Reservoir with an area of 463 ha (1,140 acres), which is built on the Jihlava River. There are 4,942 bodies of water in the basin area.[2]\n\nThe Svratka is among the popular rivers for river tourism. Two of its sections are navigable; however, the upper section is navigable only during the spring thaw and after heavy rains, and the lower section depends on the discharge of the Vír I and Vír II reservoirs. A short slalom channel is built between Vír I and Vír II.[4][5]\n• River flow at Dalečín station – Flood Warning and Forecasting Service of the Czech Hydrometeorological InstituteSvratka (Žďár nad Sázavou District) - Wikipedia: Svratka (Czech pronunciation: [ˈsvratka]) is a town in Žďár nad Sázavou District in the Vysočina Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 1,400 inhabitants.\n\nThe town parts of Česká Cikánka, Moravská Cikánka and Moravská Svratka are administrative parts of Svratka.\n\nThe town was named after the Svratka river. The name of the river itself was derived from the old Czech verb sworti, which meant 'to meander'.[2]\n\nSvratka is located about 17 kilometres (11 mi) northeast of Žďár nad Sázavou and 46 km (29 mi) northeast of Jihlava. It lies on the border between the Upper Svratka Highlands and Iron Mountains. The highest point is at 778 m (2,552 ft) above sea level. The Svratka River flows through the town; it formed here the historical border between Bohemia and Moravia. The town lies within the Žďárské vrchy Protected Landscape Area.\n\nThe first written mention of Svratka is from 1350. Important noble families took turns in ownership of Svratka: Lords of Pardubice, Poděbrady family, Berka of Dubá family, Kinsky family and Thurn und Taxis family.[2]\n\nThe 19th century saw the development of industry, which culminated in 1867 with the promotion of Svratka to a town. There was a paper mill and a match factory.[2]\n\nThere are no railways or major roads passing through the municipality.\n\nThe most valuable monument is the Church of Saint John the Baptist. It has an early Gothic core. The separate bell tower dates from around 1600.[5]"}

During the 1920s and 1930s it was often censored and even temporarily stopped. In autumn 1938, the party was abolished and during the German occupation and World War II that came soon afterwards the newspaper became an underground mimeographed pamphlet. Following the end of the war Josef Frolík became the chief administrator of the paper.[2] After the communist take-over in 1948 it became the leading newspaper in the country, the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Soviet Union's Pravda, highly propagandistic and sometimes obedient to the government. Its Slovak equivalent in Slovakia was Pravda.\n\nFollowing the Velvet Revolution, Rudé právo was privatised in 1989.[3] In addition, some editors founded a new daily, Právo, unaffiliated with the party but taking advantage of the existing reader base."}

It led to the defeat of the Bohemian Revolt and ensured Habsburg control for the next three hundred years.\n\nIt was fought on 8 November 1620. An army of 21,000 Bohemians and mercenaries under Christian of Anhalt was defeated by 23,000 men of the combined armies of Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, led by Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy, and the German Catholic League led by Johann Tserclaes, later Count of Tilly, at Bílá Hora (\"White Mountain\") near Prague.[3] Bohemian casualties were not severe but their morale collapsed and Imperial forces occupied Prague the next day.\n\nIn the early 17th century most of the Bohemian estates, although under the dominion of the predominantly Catholic Holy Roman Empire, had large Protestant populations, and had been granted rights and protections allowing them varying degrees of religious and political freedom.\n\nIn 1617, as the health of Emperor Matthias deteriorated, his cousin Ferdinand – a devout Catholic and proponent of the Counter-Reformation – was named his successor as Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia. This led to deep consternation among many Bohemian Protestants, who feared not only the loss of their properties, but also of their traditional semi-autonomy, under which many of the estates had separate, individual constitutions governing their relationship with the Empire, and where the king was elected by the local leaders.[4]\n\nFerdinand (who would become Emperor Ferdinand II following Matthias' death in 1619) saw Protestantism as inimical to the Empire, and wanted to impose absolutist rule on Bohemia while encouraging conversion to the Catholic faith. He also hoped to reclaim church properties which had been seized by Protestants at the start of the Reformation decades earlier.\n\nParticularly galling to Protestants were perceived violations of Emperor Rudolf II's 1609 Letter of Majesty, which had ensured religious freedom throughout Bohemia.[5] In May 1618, wanting to air their grievances over this and other issues, a group of Bohemian noblemen met representatives of the Emperor at the royal castle in Prague; the meeting ended with two of the representatives and their scribe being thrown out a high window and seriously injured. This incident, known as the Third Defenestration of Prague, triggered the Bohemian Revolt.[6]\n\nIn November 1619, Elector Palatine Frederick V, who like many of the rebels was a Calvinist, was chosen as King of Bohemia by the Bohemian Electorate.\n\nIn 1620, now fully established as emperor, Ferdinand II set out to conquer Bohemia and make an example of the rebels. King Frederick and his military commander, Prince Christian of Anhalt, had organized a Protestant army of 30,000 men; Ferdinand countered with a force of 25,000, many of them seasoned soldiers, under the capable leadership of Field Marshal Tilly, a Catholic Spanish-Flemish nobleman. Tilly's army enjoyed the advantage of including two successful military leaders – Tilly himself and the future General Wallenstein. Tilly's force was made up of two distinct groups: Imperial troops commanded by Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy, and soldiers of the German Catholic League, directly under Tilly. All of the armies of the day employed numerous mercenaries, including, by some definitions, Tilly himself. Serving with the Catholic League as an official observer was the future \"father of modern philosophy\", René Descartes.[7]\n\nAfter conquering most of western Bohemia, the Imperial army made for Prague, the Bohemian capital, then in rebel hands. The Bohemians attempted to block them by setting up defensive positions, which the Imperial army simply bypassed. Force-marching his men, Christian of Anhalt managed to get ahead of the Imperial army just before Prague. He thus gained an advantageous position on the \"White Mountain\", actually a low plateau, but had little time to set up defensive works. Enthusiasm for joining battle was low on both sides. After the reverses of the previous several weeks, Christian of Anhalt's army had been reduced to about 15,000 men, with little prospect of victory; the mercenaries on both sides had not been paid in months; and with winter approaching, cold wet weather made for less than ideal combat conditions.\n\nOn 8 November a small Imperial force was sent to probe the Protestant flank. To their surprise, the Bohemians retreated at their advance. Tilly quickly sent in reinforcements, and the Bohemian flank began to crumble. Anhalt tried to relieve the situation by sending forward infantry and cavalry led by his son Christian II. The cavalry charged into the Imperial infantry, causing significant casualties, but Tilly countered with his own cavalry, forcing the Bohemian horsemen to retire. The Bohemian infantry, who were only now approaching the Imperial army, saw the cavalry retreating, at which they fired one volley at extreme range before retreating themselves. A small group of Imperial cavalry began circling the Protestant forces, driving them to the middle of the battlefield. With the Bohemian army already demoralized, company after company began retreating, most without having actually entered the battle. Tilly and his Imperial cavalrymen advanced with 2,000 Bavarian hussars, steadily pushing Protestant forces back to the Star Palace (just west of Prague), where the rebels tried without success to establish a line of defense.\n\nThe Bohemian army was no match for the Emperor Ferdinand's troops. The actual battle lasted only an hour and left the Bohemian army in tatters. Some 4,000 Protestants were killed or captured, while Imperial losses amounted to only about 700.[8]\n\nWith the Bohemian army destroyed, Tilly entered Prague and the revolt collapsed. King Frederick fled the country with his wife Elizabeth after only a year on the throne (gaining him the mocking nickname the Winter King). Forty-seven leaders of the insurrection were put on trial, and twenty-seven of them were executed in Prague's Old Town Square on what came to be called the \"Old Town Square execution\". Amongst those executed were Kryštof Harant and Jan Jesenius. Today, 27 crosses have been laid into the cobblestones as a tribute to those executed. An estimated five-sixths of the Bohemian nobility went into exile soon after the Battle of White Mountain, and their properties were confiscated.[9]\n\nThere remained a strong Protestant army in Silesia under the command of Johann Georg von Brandenburg, Duke of Krnov, which continued fighting the Imperial army in Moravia and in what today is Slovakia until 1623.\n\nIn 1621, the Emperor ordered all Calvinists and other non-Lutherans to leave the realm in three days or to convert to Catholicism.[10] In 1622, he forbade practice of the Lutheran faith. In 1626, he ordered all Lutherans (most of whom had not been involved in the revolt) to convert or else leave the country.[11] By 1627, Archbishop Harrach of Prague and Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice set out to convert the heretics, as they were termed, by peaceful means; most Bohemians converted, but a significant Protestant minority remained.\n\nSpanish troops, seeking to encircle their rebellious Dutch provinces, seized the Palatinate lands. With the prospect of Protestantism being overrun in Germany, Denmark entered the struggle. Sweden was to join the Protestant forces in 1630.\n\nThe population in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown declined by about a third until the end of the war.\n\nThe result of the 1620 battle brought two centuries of recatholicization of the Czech lands and the decline of the Czech-speaking aristocracy and elite as well as the Czech language (accompanied with the growing influence of German-speaking elites), a process that was slowed by the Czech National Revival starting in the late 18th century. Czech nationalist historians and writers such as Alois Jirásek have referred to the 17th and 18th century in the Czech lands as the Dark Age.\n• The History of the Thirty Years' War by Friedrich Schiller\n• Tomáš Kleisner, Giovanni Pietro de Pomis Medal of the Battle of the White Mountain\n• None Guthrie, W.P.

ISBN .\n• Kafkadesk.org - \"...in 1620: the Bohemian estates were defeated at the Battle of White Mountain\"The Czech trauma of Bílá Hora: On 8 November according to the new reckoning in the year 1620 the two mighty armies, that is to say, the imperial army and that of King Frederick the count of the Palatinate, held a great battle in which both sides fought bravely and many thousand men were killed. Finally the imperial forces won the victory by putting the Bohemians to flight and the unhappy King Frederick with his wife and children had to flee the kingdom that very same day.\n\nImmediately after the Prague defenestration the rebels took over government in Bohemia, declaring Ferdinand II’s election as king of Bohemia invalid and putting his place the Elector Palatine Frederick V, who was destined only to hold office for a short time and thus earned the nickname of the ‘Winter King’. After his election to the imperial crown in September 1619, Emperor Ferdinand II concluded an alliance with his cousin Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria, thus securing the support of the Catholic League. Bavarian troops under the command of Count Tilly promptly occupied the likewise rebellious land of Upper Austria and took radical measures to suppress the Reformation there.\n\nFrom summer 1620 onwards Catholic troops advanced on Prague. The decisive confrontation came on 8 November 1620, when all Ferdinand II’s problems were solved with one blow: at the Battle of the White Mountain (in Czech, ‘Bílá Hora’), the Emperor, supported by the Catholic League, defeated the Protestant Bohemian Estates. The 21,000 soldiers of the rebels faced an alliance of 12,000 soldiers of the Emperor and 14,000 of the League – the battle was over in two hours, with around 2,000 soldiers losing their lives. The victory was ascribed to the assistance of the Virgin Mary, the veneration of whom was one of the bones of contention that separated Catholics and Protestants.\n\nThe battle had grave consequences for Bohemia: the ‘Winter King’ Frederick had to flee and once again Ferdinand II was ruler. On 21 June 1621 there was a sitting of a Blutgericht, a court with authority to impose the death penalty: 27 persons were publicly executed, some heads being exhibited at public places for years afterwards. In the lands of the Bohemian crown there followed a process of forced re-Catholicization, which was also applied to the Austrian lands. The Emperor punished the country severely: many Protestants went or were driven into exile. Land estates were redistributed in favour of the Catholics. One of those who benefited from the huge restructuring of the country’s wealth was the Habsburg military commander Albrecht von Wallenstein. On account of its brutal consequences, Bílá Hora became a trauma for the land: in nineteenth-century Czech historiography the period between the Battle of the White Mountain and the Czech national revival was referred to as the doba temna or ‘dark time’."}

Together with Jiří Suchý he significantly influenced Czech pop music and theatre in the 1960s.\n\nJiří Šlitr went to gymnasium in Jilemnice, then in Rychnov nad Kněžnou. He graduated in 1943 and worked as a clerk in Bělá pod Bezdězem until the end of World War II.[1] He then studied law at Charles University in Prague and in 1949 received a doctorate in law (academic degree JUDr. – he never practiced as a lawyer, but was later nicknamed Doctor Piano). In 1948 he founded the Czechoslovak Dixieland Jazz Band with former classmates from Rychnov. He occasionally played with Akord Club, and toured with the Miroslav Horníček theatre ensemble as pianist. In 1957 Horníček introduced him to Jiří Suchý, and the Suchý + Šlitr duo began to perform in the Reduta theatre and Vltava café. Next year was the Brussels Expo 58: Šlitr was there as part of the Laterna Magika theatre.[1] In 1959 he began to perform in the newly founded Semafor theatre, which became his principal venue.\n\nJiří Šlitr, with lyricist-playwright Jiří Suchý and clarinetist Ferdinand Havlík, was a key exponent of the \"golden era\" of the Semafor Theatre.[2] His first work with Jiří Suchý was Píseň o Hamletovi (Song about Hamlet). Člověk z půdy (Man from Attic) — their first play for the Semafor, with music by Šlitr – was a remarkable success. The 1962 play Jonáš a tingl tangl (Jonáš and Tingl Tangl) featured Šlitr in his first acting role; he and Suchý became a well-known acting duo. In 1964 Šlitr won the 6th place in the Czechoslovak singer contest Zlatý slavík (The Golden Nightingale).\n\nThe double-act of Šlitr and Suchý made film appearances, firstly in Bylo nás deset (There Were Ten Of Us, 1963) and later in the successful musical comedy Kdyby 1000 klarinetů (If a Thousand Clarinets, 1964). In 1965 Šlitr composed the jazz opera Dobře placená procházka (A Walk Worthwhile), which was staged in 2007 by the Czech-American director Miloš Forman at the National Theatre in Prague.[3] Šlitr's attempt to stage A Walk Worthwhile on Broadway was unsuccessful.\n\nŠlitr wanted to play and compose in a modern \"rock\" style at the Semafor but Havlík disagreed. In 1966 Šlitr fired the Ferdinand Havlík Orchestra, but in the end he wound down his own involvement with the Semafor and with Suchý. The duo parted company for a short time, and Šlitr put on a new play Ďábel z Vinohrad (The Devil from Vinohrady). Meanwhile, he exhibited his drawings in Wiesbaden, Dortmund, and New York City. In 1967 he attended Expo 67 in Montreal, where he presented the show \"Stars of Prague\", and during his stay in America he exhibited drawings in Hollywood and Houston. In 1968 he reunited with Suchý and after the events of the Prague Spring he restaged his earlier work The Devil from Vinohrady as a pointed response to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Šlitr and Suchý also signed the anti-communist 2000 Words manifesto by Ludvík Vaculík. In 1968, Šlitr appeared in his last film, Zločin v šantánu (Crime in the Night Club).\n\nŠlitr died on 26 December 1969, under circumstances that have never been fully explained. He was last seen going to his atelier in Prague. Several hours later, members of his family found his car outside the building. Inside the atelier they found the bodies of Šlitr and his young girlfriend, who were later found to have died of coal gas poisoning. Public speculations of suicide were unproven.[2]\n• Jiří Šlitr at the National Theatre in Prague website Archived 27 September 2011 at the Wayback MachineMišo Suchý: By continuing to use this site, you agree to the use of cookies in accordance with our privacy policy.Suchý - Wikipedia: Suchý is a municipality and village in Blansko District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic.

It stands on a difficult-to-access and steep promontory above the confluence of the Vltava and Otava rivers. The castle is one of the most important early-Gothic castles in Czech lands.\n\nThe area was inhabited as early as prehistoric times, when the Celts built a fort here in the 1st century AD. The current castle was built in the first half of the 13th century, most probably on the orders of King Ottokar I, but the exact date is not known. The first written mention of the castle comes from year 1234 and owned by the Kings of Bohemia.\n\nOriginally a small complex, the castle was continuously extended until 1278. After the Přemyslid dynasty died out in 1306, Zvíkov became property of the Rosenberg family. After 1337 the settlement under the castle has been fortified, as a part of thorough repairs. Its fortifications were so strong that even the Hussites, during the Hussite Wars, besieged it for four months in 1429, but found it a tough nut to crack and failed to take it. To protect against heavy artillery its walls were further strengthened.\n\nAlthough Emperor Charles IV placed it on a list of royal castles not to be pawned, his successors ignored his decree and by 1431 it was in the possession of the Rosenberg family. At the start of Thirty Years' War Zvíkov was owned by a rebellious Protestant nobleman whose garrison of 140 men successfully defended the castle against 4,000 Habsburg troops in 1618.[2] The defendants agreed to capitulate to the Emperor's forces only in October 1622. Subsequently, it was looted and devastated. During the 1640s the Schwambergs modified the palace and extended it in Renaissance style.\n\nAfter the damage inflicted by the war, Zvíkov was restored, but its glory was long gone and the castle served only for farming purposes. A fire accelerated the deterioration of its buildings in 1751. Thus a once-important seat of Czech kings it had become an almost ruin by the 1840s, at which time the Schwarzenbergs, owners of the ruin, invested huge sums in a thorough reconstruction, which restored the heart of the castle to its former glory.\n\nAt the end of 17th century it ceased to have military value and was used as granary. The decline continued and in 1751 fire damaged a large part of the palace. In 1780 the chapel was deconsecrated. The facade of the palace collapsed in 1829 and between 1880 and 1902 the castle was reconstructed, only to be confiscated by the state in 1947.\n\nThe Orlík Dam, which was built between 1954 and 1962 and named after Orlík Castle, deluged the castle downtown and made Zvíkov easily accessible. Major restorations between 1970 and 1980 concentrated on the palace.\n\nThe oldest part of Zvíkov is a massive prismatic residential tower named Hlízová with palace buildings built on its sides. During the reign of Ottokar II of Bohemia, a palace named Královský (\"King's Own\") was built and this ground plan has been preserved until today. The new palace was built in lavish style and its parts were connected by monumental arcade.\n\nAfter 1473, Bohuslav of Schwamberg commissioned mural decorations in the Chapel of St. Wenceslaus, which belongs to the masterpieces of early-gothic Czech architecture. The walls display the patron saints of Bohemia, the Virgin Mary the Protector, the Suffering Christ and the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus. The fortification was extended with Hláska, large 32-metre (105 ft) high tower (bergfrit) on the south side. The castle has two gates.\n\nThe castle has its own ghost, Zvíkov's imp,[3] and had inspired several painters and writers like the theatrical comedy Zvíkovský rarášek by Ladislav Stroupežnický. Today, Zvíkov (opened from Spring to Autumn) is hiking attraction and serves as a place of art exhibitions and stage plays.Hrad Zvíkov – Burg Klingenberg - Burg Zvikov, Böhmen: Hrad Zvíkov – zu Deutsch Burg Klingenberg oder Burg Zvikov – steht einen Kilometer nördlich des Dorfes Zvíkovské Podhradí im Bezirk Písek in Tschechien. Das oft als „König der tschechischen Burgen“ bezeichnete Schloss im frühgotischen Stil erhebt sich malerisch auf einem Felssporn über dem Zusammenfluss der Flüsse Moldau und Otava. Es gehört zu den wichtigsten frühgotischen Burgen Tschechiens.\n\nDie Burg Zvikov wurde ab 1226 erbaut und war im Laufe ihrer wechselvollen Geschichte unter Adelsfamilien ein begehrtes Objekt. Während ihrer Blütezeit residierten hier sogar böhmische Könige, die den günstigen Standort an dem wichtigen Handelsweg zu schätzen wussten. Vor allem gab sie ihren Bewohnern Sicherheit vor Feinden. Dafür war es günstig, dass die Burg gut befestigt und nur über eine schmale Straße zu erreichen ist.\n\nDie königliche Burg Zvíkov wurde am Ende der Herrschaft des Königs Přemysl Otakar I. (gestorben 1230) gegründet. Der älteste Teil der Anlage ist der mächtige prismatische Turm „Markomanka“. Zum Turm kam später der Königspalast, der unter der Herrschaft des Königs Přemysl Otakar II fertiggestellt wurde. Der Palast hat den Grundriss eines unregelmäßigen Fünfecks und verfügt über einen Innenhof, der von einer Arkadengalerie umgeben ist. Nach der Fertigstellung des Palastes wurden im 13. Jahrhundert starke Befestigungen mit Toren und einem Wachturm errichtet.\n\nIm 14. und 15. Jahrhundert diente die Burg Klingenberg mit ihrem mächtigen Befestigungssystem dem Schutz der Adligen vor Übergriffen. Im Gefahrenfall entkamen sie hinter den starken Mauern. Der wohl berühmteste Bewohner von Hrad Zvíkov in dieser Zeit war König Karl IV. Auch er ließ die Burg erweitern und modernisieren und bewohnte sie, bis seine Burg Karlštejn bei Prag fertiggestellt war. Zeitweise hatte er auf Zvikov wahrscheinlich sogar die Kronjuwelen gesichert.\n\nIm Laufe der Jahrhunderte wechselten vielfach die Besitzer, zu denen die Adelsfamilien Přemysl, Rosenberg, Schwanberg, Eggenberg und Schwarzenberg gehörten. Letztendlich wurde die Familie Schwarzenberg 1948 enteignet, wodurch die Burg Zvikov in den Besitz des tschechischen Staates gelangte. Durch den Bau des Orlik-Staudamms oberhalb der Burg in den 1950er Jahren wurde ein Teil der Burganlage überflutet. Dennoch gibt es für Touristen in Hrad Zvíkov nach wie vor viel Interessantes zu entdecken."}

It has about 49,000 inhabitants. It is located at the confluence of the Ohře and Teplá rivers.\n\nKarlovy Vary is named after Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Bohemia, who founded the city in the 14th century. The site of numerous hot springs, the city grew into a spa resort in the 19th century and was a popular destination for the European aristocracy and other luminaries. Karlovy Vary's rapid growth was brought to an end by the outbreak of World War I. After the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Karlovy Vary once again became a major tourist destination.\n\nKarlovy Vary is the most visited spa town in the Czech Republic. In 2021, the city became part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site under the name \"Great Spa Towns of Europe\" because of its spas and architecture from the 18th through 20th centuries. The historic city centre with the spa cultural landscape is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.\n\nKarlovy Vary is made up of 15 municipal parts:[2]\n\nCihelny forms an exclave of the municipal territory.\n\nThe city is named after its founder. The name Karlovy Vary means literally \"Charles' Baths\". The city was also colloquially called Warmbad (German for \"hot bath\").[4]\n\nKarlovy Vary is located about 106 kilometres (66 mi) west of Prague. The northern part of the municipal territory with most of the built-up area lies in a relatively flat landscape of the Sokolov Basin. The southern part, including the valley of the Teplá River, lies in a hilly landscape of the Slavkov Forest and in the eponymous protected landscape area. The highest point is the hill Vítkův vrch at 642 m (2,106 ft) above sea level.\n\nThe city lies at the confluence of the Ohře (which flows across the city) with the Teplá and Rolava rivers. There are several small bodies of water in the northern half of the Karlovy Vary territory. The most notable is the natural reservoir Rolava, which is located right in the centre of the city. It is used for recreational purposes.[5]\n\nKarlovy Vary's climate is classified as humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb; Trewartha: Dclo). Among them, the annual average temperature is 7.4 °C (45.3 °F), the hottest month in July is 17.2 °C (63.0 °F), and the coldest month is −1.8 °C (28.8 °F) in January. The annual precipitation is 568.4 millimetres (22.38 in), of which June is the wettest with 71.1 millimetres (2.80 in), while February is the driest with only 27.8 millimetres (1.09 in). The extreme temperature throughout the year ranged from −25.1 °C (−13.2 °F) on 21 December 1969 to 35.8 °C (96.4 °F) on 27 July 1983 and 20 August 2012.\n\nAn ancient late Bronze Age fortified settlement was found in Drahovice. A Slavic settlement on the site of Karlovy Vary is documented by findings in Tašovice and Sedlec. People lived in close proximity to the site as far back as the 13th century and they must have been aware of the curative effects of thermal springs.[10]\n\nFrom the end of the 12th century to the early 13th century, German settlers from nearby German-speaking regions came as settlers, craftsmen and miners to develop the region's economy. Eventually, Karlovy Vary/Karlsbad became a town with a German-speaking population.[11]\n\nIn 1325, Obora, a village in today's city area, was mentioned. Karlovy Vary as a small spa settlement was founded most likely around 1349.[10] According to legend, Charles IV organized an expedition into the forests surrounding modern-day Karlovy Vary during a stay in Loket. It is said that his party once discovered a hot spring by accident, and thanks to the water from the spring, Charles IV healed his injured leg.[12] On the site of a spring, he established a spa mentioned as in dem warmen Bade bey dem Elbogen in German, or Horké Lázně u Lokte (Hot Spas at the Loket).[13] The location was subsequently named \"Karlovy Vary\" after the emperor. Charles IV granted the town privileges on 14 August 1370. Earlier settlements can also be found on the outskirts of today's city.[10]\n\nAn important political event took place in the city in 1819, with the issuing of the Carlsbad Decrees following a conference there. Initiated by the Austrian Minister of State Klemens von Metternich, the decrees were intended to implement anti-liberal censorship within the German Confederation.\n\nDue to publications produced by physicians such as David Becher and Josef von Löschner, the city developed into a spa resort in the 19th century and was visited by many members of European aristocracy as well as celebrities from many fields of endeavour. It became even more popular after railway lines were completed from Prague to Cheb in 1870.\n\nThe number of visitors rose from 134 families in the 1756 season to 26,000 guests annually at the end of the 19th century.[citation needed] The greatest year for tourism was 1911, when the number of visitors reached 70,956.[14] World War I ended the development of tourism. Other disasters for tourism were the world economic crisis and the beginning of World War II.[15]\n\nAt the end of World War I in 1918, the large German-speaking population of Bohemia was incorporated into the new state of Czechoslovakia in accordance with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919). As a result, the German-speaking majority of Karlovy Vary protested. A demonstration on 4 March 1919 passed peacefully, but later that month, six demonstrators were killed by Czech troops after a demonstration became unruly.[16]\n\nAccording to the 1930 census, the city was home to 23,901 inhabitants – 20,856 were ethnic Germans, 1,446 were Czechoslovaks (Czechs or Slovaks), 243 were Jews, 19 were Hungarians and 12 were Poles.[17]\n\nIn 1938, the city was annexed by Nazi Germany according to the terms of the Munich Agreement and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. During World War II, the Germans established a Gestapo prison here.[18] After the war, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and Beneš decrees, most German inhabitants were expelled.\n\nAfter the Velvet Revolution in 1989, spas and tourism began to develop rapidly again. The spa buildings were reconstructed and the spa became competitive again within Europe.[15] The spa became popular with Russian clientele, and brought many Russian investors and developers to the city and its surroundings.[19]\n\nIn 2017, non-Czech residents were around 7% of the population of the Karlovy Vary region. After Prague, this is the highest proportion in the Czech Republic. The largest group of foreigners were Vietnamese, followed by Germans, Ukrainians and Russians.[20]\n\nThe city's economy is focused on services and only small and medium-sized industrial enterprises are based in it. The main industry is the food and beverage industry, characterized by the bottling of mineral waters and the production of unique delicacies. The largest industrial employer based in the city is Mattoni 1873.[23] Karlovy Vary is known for the popular Czech liqueur Becherovka, which has been produced here since 1807. The Karlovarské oplatky (Carlsbad wafers) originated in the city in 1867. The city has also lent its name to \"Carlsbad plums\", candied stuffed prune plums.\n\nThe second important industry is the production of glass and porcelain. Karlovy Vary is known for the lead glass manufacturer Moser Glass founded in 1857, which is considered the most luxurious Czech brand.[24]\n\nThe Karlovy Vary agglomeration was defined as a tool for drawing money from the European Structural and Investment Funds. It is an area that includes the city and its surroundings, linked to the city by commuting and migration. It has about 138,000 inhabitants.\n\nKarlovy Vary is the most visited spa town in the Czech Republic.[25] As the principal city on the West Bohemian Spa Triangle and the largest spa complex in Europe, Karlovy Vary has over 80 springs.[26] They are a part of the Eger Graben, a tectonically active region in western Bohemia. Although the infiltration area is several hundred square kilometres, each spring has the same hydrological origins, and therefore shares the same dissolved minerals and chemical formula. The hottest of the springs can approach 74 °C, while the coldest have temperatures under 40 degrees. All of the springs combined provide roughly 2,000 litres of water every minute.[26]\n\nLocal buses (Dopravní podnik Karlovy Vary) and cable cars take passengers to most areas of the city. The Imperial funicular is the oldest tunnel funicular in Europe and the steepest in the Czech Republic, the Diana funicular was at the time of commissioning the longest funicular in Austria-Hungary.[27][28]\n\nThe city is accessible via the D6 motorway and inter-city public transport options include inter-city buses, České dráhy, and Deutsche Bahn via the Karlovy Vary–Johanngeorgenstadt railway. Karlovy Vary Airport is an international airport located 4.5 kilometres (3 mi) southeast from the city centre, at the village of Olšová Vrata.\n\nIn the 19th century, Karlovy Vary became a popular tourist destination, especially known for international celebrities who visited for spa treatment. The city is also known for the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, which is one of the oldest in the world and one of Europe's major film events.\n\nThe city has been used as the location for a number of film-shoots, including the 2006 films Last Holiday and Casino Royale, both of which used the city's Grandhotel Pupp in different guises. Moreover, the Palace Bristol Hotel in Karlovy Vary was used as a model for The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nKarlovy Vary is home to the top-tier ice hockey club HC Karlovy Vary, and the top-tier volleyball club VK Karlovarsko.\n\nThe city is also represented by the football club FC Slavia Karlovy Vary, which plays in the third tier of the Czech football system.\n\nKarlovy Vary is notable for its large concentration of monuments and architecturally valuable buildings. The origin of most of them is connected with the spa tradition of the city. Since 2018, the spa centre of the city along the Teplá river and the wider surroundings with the spa cultural landscape have been protected as an urban monument reservation.[29] As part of the Great Spa Towns of Europe, Karlovy Vary became a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of its spas and architecture from the 18th through 20th centuries.[30]\n\nCísařské lázně is the most important spa building, protected as a national cultural monument. It was built in the historicist style of the French Neo-Renaissance in 1893–1895.[31] The largest colonnade with five mineral springs is the Mill Colonnade (Czech: Mlýnská; pseudo-Renaissance structure, built in 1871–1881). The best-known spring is Vřídlo, located in Hot Spring Colonnade (Vřídelní; built in Functionalistic style in 1975). The spring gushes out in a geyser up to 12 m (39 ft) high. Other colonnades in the city are Park Colonnade (Sadová; cast-iron architecture structure built in 1880–1881 by Fellner & Helmer), Market Colonnade (Tržní; a wooden structure, built in Swiss style in 1882–1883 by Fellner & Helmer), and Castle Colonnade (Zámecká; built in Art Nouveau style in 1910–1912 by Friedrich Ohmann).[32]\n\nThe most valuable church is the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene. It is a Catholic church, built in the Baroque style in 1732–1736 on the site of an old Gothic church from the second half of the 14th century. It was built according to the design by Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer and belongs to the most important buildings of the Czech Baroque. It is protected as a national cultural monument.[33]\n\nAmong the most famous buildings of the city is the Church of Saint Peter and Paul. It was built in the Byzantine style in 1893–1897. It is the largest Orthodox church west of Post-Soviet states.[34]\n\nThe Church of Saint Andrew was built in the late Gothic style around 1500, reconstructed in the Empire style in 1840–1841. A cemetery was established next to the church for foreign guests of the spa who died in Karlovy Vary. In 1911, the cemetery was converted into a park, known as Mozart's Park, with many Neoclassical tombstones. Since 2005, it is owned by the Greek Catholic Church.[35][36]\n\nThe Church of Saint Anne was built in the Baroque style in 1738–1749 on the site of an old church. It is a pilgrimage church, in the construction of which K. I. Dientzenhofer took part.[37]\n\nThe Church of Saints Peter and Paul is a pseudo-Gothic church, built in 1854–1856 and rebuilt in 1893–1894. Since 1946, it is property of the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.[38]\n\nThe Church of Saint Luke is a Methodist pseudo-Gothic two-aisle church, built in 1876–1877. It was built with the financial support of English spa guests. Today it no longer serves religious purposes and houses a wax museum.[39]\n\nThe Church of Saint Leonard of Noblac was the oldest ecclesiastical structure in the territory of Karlovy Vary. It was first documented in 1246. This late Romanesque structure is located in the woods south of the city proper, where a village used to be. From the end of the 15th century, after the village was depopulated, the church began to deteriorate and became a ruin.[40]\n• Peter the Great (1672–1725), Tsar of Russia; visited Karlovy Vary in 1711 41\n• James Ogilvy, 7th Earl of Findlater (1750–1811), Scottish noble and an accomplished amateur landscape architect and philanthropist; regularly visited the spa and became a patron of the city\n• Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827), composer; came twice for spa treatments.

Kometa Brno v Mountfield HKHC Kometa Brno - Wikipedia: HC Kometa Brno (\"Comet\" in English) is a professional ice hockey team based in Brno, Czech Republic. They play in the Czech Extraliga. Kometa is the most successful ice hockey club in the Czech Republic with 13 Czechoslovak (and Czech) league championship titles. Holding three European Cup titles, Kometa ranks as the most successful Czech club in international ice hockey. The team HC Kometa Brno has won two Czech championships seasons, capturing the title in both 2016–17 and in 2017–18.\n\nThe club was founded in 1953 as an army ice hockey club with the name Rudá hvězda Brno (\"Red Star\"). The majority of players were transferred from two hockey clubs in Brno (TJ Spartak Brno Zbrojovka and TJ Spartak GZ Královo Pole[1]). In 1962, the club changed its name to ZKL Brno (ZKL is an abbreviation of \"Ball Bearing Factory\")[2] and stopped being an army team. In 1976, the name was changed to Zetor Brno. Shortly after the revolution (1994), the club changed its name to HC Kometa Brno. \"Kometa\" was the team's nickname since the 1950s (as opposed to the official \"Red Star\") and the team was commonly referred to by this name since its beginning.\n\nIn 1996, the team was relegated from Czech Extraliga to the second highest ice hockey league, the 1st Czech Republic Hockey League. For many years, the team struggled due to poor financing and multiple changes of owners, facing relegation again in 2001–2002. The club almost ceased to exist, playing in the East division of the third-highest Czech ice hockey league. By the 2003–2004 season, it returned to the first league. In 2004, Kometa played its first playoff series since 1997, reached the semifinals in 2008, and reached the finals in 2009.\n\nOn 1 April 2009, Kometa bought the licence for another South Moravian club, HC Znojemští Orli. This club began to serve as a farm team for Brno.[3]\n\nIn March 2012, the team managed to defeat HC Sparta Praha, the winner of the 2011–12 Czech Extraliga regular season, in six games, qualifying for the playoff semifinals.[4] In the semifinals, they defeated HC Plzeň 1929, the runner-up of the regular season, in five games. In the final, Kometa lost the Czech Extraliga championship final to HC Pardubice in six games.[5]\n• The old stadium behind Lužánky park\n• The closing of the season 2011"}

It is loosely based on the novel Hovno Hoří (\"shit on fire\") by Petr Šabach. Readers of Reflex magazine voted it as the best Czech film in 2011.[2] Cosy Dens was screened at the 1999 Vancouver International Film Festival.[3]\n\nCosy Dens is a bittersweet coming-of-age story set in the months from Christmas 1967 up to the 1968 Prague Spring. Teenager Michal Šebek has a crush on his upstairs neighbour, Jindřiška Krausová. Michal's family is led by a stubborn army officer who is a firm supporter of the Communist system and who believes that Communist technology will eventually triumph over \"Western imperialist capitalism', while Jindřiška's father is an ardent foe of the Communists and a war hero, who has been imprisoned several times because of his outspoken opposition to the regime. He believes that \"the Bolsheviks have a year left at most, maybe two\". In contrast, the younger generation could not care less for politics. Instead, Michal sports a Beatles-style mop-top, while Elien, whose parents live in the United States, runs a local film group specialising in Hollywood and pre-war French films. Jindřiška eventually becomes Elien's girlfriend. After a wedding that unites the families, the film ends with the news of the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops.\n\nThe Czech title is a plural and diminutive of the word \"pelech\", literally meaning animal den or burrow. It is used figuratively for a cosy place to sleep.[4]\n\nThe soundtrack to Cosy Dens was released in April 1999 and contains snippets of dialogue in addition to songs.[5]\n• The Matadors – \"Get Down from the Tree\"\n• The Soulmen – \"Baby Do Not Cry\"\n• The Soulmen – \"I Wish I Were\"Cosy Dens (1999) ⭐ 8.1 | Comedy, Drama: i saw pelisky in 2000 at the international film festival in aukland, new zealand. almost 5 years later, having only seen the film that one time, i cannot forget how much i loved it. wonderfully funny and tragic, extremely well-acted, by far the best foreign language film in the festival. it was the the highest grossing czech film of the year at the czech box office, third only to titanic and kolya. unfortunately, i'm not sure if it made it into any American theatres and i have not been able to locate a copy since i returned home. if at all possible you get your hands on a copy of pelisky, i promise you will adore this film."}

Situated on the Vltava river, Prague is home to about 1.4 million people.\n\nPrague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architectures. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346–1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575–1611).[9] It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and Austria-Hungary. The city played major roles in the Bohemian and the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years' War and in 20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the World Wars and the post-war Communist era.[10]\n\nPrague is home to a number of cultural attractions including Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical clock, the Jewish Quarter, Petřín hill and Vyšehrad. Since 1992, the historic center of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe city has more than ten major museums, along with numerous theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. An extensive modern public transportation system connects the city. It is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including Charles University in Prague, the oldest university in Central Europe.\n\nPrague is classified as an \"Beta+\" global city according to GaWC studies.[11] In 2019, the PICSA Index ranked the city as 13th most livable city in the world.[12] Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination and as of 2017, the city receives more than 8.5 million international visitors annually. In 2017, Prague was listed as the fifth most visited European city after London, Paris, Rome, and Istanbul.[13]\n\nThe Czech name Praha is derived from an old Slavic word, práh, which means \"ford\" or \"rapid\", referring to the city's origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river.[14]\n\nAnother view to the origin of the name is also related to the Czech word práh (with the meaning of a threshold) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess Libuše, prophetess and a wife of the mythical founder of the Přemyslid dynasty. She is said to have ordered the city \"to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house\". The Czech práh might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river – thus providing a \"threshold\" to the castle.\n\nAnother derivation of the name Praha is suggested from na prazě, the original term for the shale hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city – the Old Town on the opposite side of the river, as well as the Lesser Town beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.[15]\n\nThe English spelling of the city's name is borrowed from French. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was pronounced in English to rhyme with \"vague\": it was so pronounced by Lady Diana Cooper (born 1892) on Desert Island Discs in 1969,[16] and it is written to rhyme with \"vague\" in a verse of The Beleaguered City by Longfellow (1839) and also in the limerick There was an Old Lady of Prague by Edward Lear (1846).\n\nPrague is also called the \"City of a Hundred Spires\", based on a count by 19th century mathematician Bernard Bolzano; today's count is estimated by the Prague Information Service at 500.[17] Nicknames for Prague have also included: the Golden City, the Mother of Cities and the Heart of Europe.[18]\n\nThe local Jewish community, which belongs to one of the oldest continuously existing in the world, have described the city as עיר ואם בישראל Ir va-em be-yisrael, \"The city and mother in Israel\".[19][20]\n\nPrague has grown from a settlement stretching from Prague Castle in the north to the fort of Vyšehrad in the south, to become the capital of a modern European country.\n\nThe region was settled as early as the Paleolithic age.[21] Jewish chronicler David Solomon Ganz, citing Cyriacus Spangenberg, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in 1306 BC by an ancient king, Boyya.[22]\n\nAround the fifth and fourth century BC, a Celtic tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements, including the largest Celtic oppidum in Bohemia, Závist, in a present-day south suburb Zbraslav in Prague, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means \"home of the Boii people\".[21][23] In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards and possibly the Suebi), leading some to place the seat of the Marcomanni king, Maroboduus, in Závist.[24][22] Around the area where present-day Prague stands, the 2nd century map drawn by Roman geographer Ptolemaios mentioned a Germanic city called Casurgis.[25]\n\nIn the late 5th century AD, during the great Migration Period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the Slavic tribes settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the Czech tribes built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the Šárka valley, Butovice and Levý Hradec.[21]\n\nThe construction of what came to be known as Prague Castle began near the end of the 9th century, expanding a fortified settlement that had existed on the site since the year 800.[26] The first masonry under Prague Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest.[27] The other prominent Prague fort, the Přemyslid fort Vyšehrad, was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than Prague Castle.[28] Prague Castle is dominated by the cathedral, which began construction in 1344, but was not completed until the 20th century.[29]\n\nThe legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess Libuše and her husband, Přemysl, founder of the Přemyslid dynasty. Legend says that Libuše came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied: \"I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars\". She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site.[21]\n\nThe region became the seat of the dukes, and later kings of Bohemia. Under Duke of Bohemia Boleslaus II the Pious the area became a bishopric in 973.[30] Until Prague was elevated to archbishopric in 1344, it was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Mainz.[31]\n\nPrague was an important seat for trading where merchants from across Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the Hispano-Jewish merchant and traveler Abraham ben Jacob.[32] The Old New Synagogue of 1270 still stands in the city. Prague was also once home to a slave market.[33]\n\nAt the site of the ford in the Vltava river, King Vladislaus I had the first bridge built in 1170, the Judith Bridge (Juditin most), named in honor of his wife Judith of Thuringia.[34] This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1342, but some of the original foundation stones of that bridge remain in the river. It was rebuilt and named the Charles Bridge.[34]\n\nIn 1257, under King Ottokar II, Malá Strana (\"Lesser Quarter\") was founded in Prague on the site of an older village in what would become the Hradčany (Prague Castle) area.[35] This was the district of the German people, who had the right to administer the law autonomously, pursuant to Magdeburg rights.[36] The new district was on the bank opposite of the Staré Město (\"Old Town\"), which had borough status and was bordered by a line of walls and fortifications.\n\nPrague flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346–1378) of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the king of Bohemia of the new Luxembourg dynasty. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital. In the 1470s, Prague had around 70,000 inhabitants and with an area of 360 ha (~1.4 square miles) it was the third-largest city in the Holy Roman Empire.[37]\n\nCharles IV ordered the building of the New Town (Nové Město) adjacent to the Old Town and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. In 1347, he founded Charles University, the oldest university in Central Europe.[38]\n\nHis father John of Bohemia began construction of the Gothic Saint Vitus Cathedral, within the largest of the Prague Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda there. Prague was elevated to an archbishopric in 1344,[39] the year the cathedral was begun.\n\nThe city had a mint and was a center of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants. The social order, however, became more turbulent due to the rising power of the craftsmen's guilds (themselves often torn by internal conflicts), and the increasing number of poor.[40][41]\n\nThe Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Malá Strana and the castle area was built during a famine in the 1360s. The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.[42][43]\n\nCharles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King Wenceslaus IV (1378–1419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Prague (ca 750 people) was murdered.[44][45]\n\nJan Hus, a theologian and rector at Charles University, preached in Prague. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the Bethlehem Chapel. Inspired by John Wycliffe, these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the Council of Constance, put on trial for heresy, and burned at the stake in Konstanz in 1415.\n\nFour years later Prague experienced its first defenestration, when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest Jan Želivský. Hus' death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and proto-Protestantism, had spurred the Hussite Wars. Peasant rebels, led by the general Jan Žižka, along with Hussite troops from Prague, defeated Emperor Sigismund, in the Battle of Vítkov Hill in 1420.\n\nDuring the Hussite Wars when Prague was attacked by \"Crusader\" and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the Prague Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately 4 by 6 ft (1.2 by 1.8 m), with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the center. The words \"PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE\" (The Lord is our Relief/Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding.\n\nOne of these banners was captured by Swedish troops during the Battle of Prague (1648) when they captured the western bank of the Vltava river and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the Royal Military Museum in Stockholm; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the Codex Gigas and the Codex Argenteus. The earliest evidence indicates that a gonfalon with a municipal charge painted on it was used for the Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.\n\nIn the following two centuries, Prague strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings[46][47] were erected and Vladislav Hall of the Prague Castle was added.\n\nIn 1526, the Bohemian estates elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg. The fervent Catholicism of its members brought them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity.[49] These problems were not preeminent under Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover as well, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, the painter Arcimboldo, the alchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee, the poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, and others.\n\nIn 1618, the famous second defenestration of Prague provoked the Thirty Years' War, a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. Ferdinand II of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by Frederick V, Elector Palatine; however his army was crushed in the Battle of White Mountain (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others. Prague was forcibly converted back to Roman Catholicism followed by the rest of Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by Electorate of Saxony (1631) and during the Battle of Prague (1648).[50] Prague began a steady decline which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000. In the second half of the 17th century, Prague's population began to grow again. Jews had been in Prague since the end of the 10th century and, by 1708, they accounted for about a quarter of Prague's population.[51]\n\nIn 1689, a great fire devastated Prague, but this spurred a renovation and a rebuilding of the city. In 1713–14, a major outbreak of plague hit Prague one last time, killing 12,000 to 13,000 people.[52]\n\nIn 1744, Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Bohemia. He took Prague after a severe and prolonged siege in the course of which a large part of the town was destroyed.[54] Empress Maria Theresa expelled the Jews from Prague in 1745; though she rescinded the expulsion in 1748, the proportion of Jewish residents in the city never recovered.[55] In 1757 the Prussian bombardment[54] destroyed more than one-quarter of the city and heavily damaged St. Vitus Cathedral. However, a month later, Frederick the Great was defeated and forced to retreat from Bohemia.\n\nThe economy of Prague continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and music, creating a Baroque city renowned throughout the world to this day.\n\nIn 1784, under Joseph II, the four municipalities of Malá Strana, Nové Město, Staré Město, and Hradčany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called Josefov, was included only in 1850. The Industrial Revolution produced great changes and developments in Prague, as new factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby regions. The first suburb, Karlín, was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\n\nThe revolutions in Europe in 1848 also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the Czech National Revival began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a large number of German speakers in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase in the city's overall population caused by the influx of Czechs from the rest of Bohemia and Moravia and the increasing prestige and importance of the Czech language as part of the Czech National Revival. In 1891, the city council ordered that all German inscriptions be removed in Prague, while Czechs at the same time demanded equal status for the Czech and German languages in Bohemia and Moravia.[56]\n\nWorld War I ended with the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the creation of Czechoslovakia. Prague was chosen as its capital and Prague Castle as the seat of president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. At this time Prague was a true European capital with highly developed industry. By 1930, the population had risen to 850,000.\n\nHitler ordered the German Army to enter Prague on 15 March 1939, and from Prague Castle proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate. For most of its history, Prague had been a multi-ethnic city[57] with important Czech, German and (mostly native German-speaking) Jewish populations.[58] From 1939, when the country was occupied by Nazi Germany, Hitler took over Prague Castle. During the Second World War, most Jews were deported and killed by the Germans. In 1942, Prague was witness to the assassination of one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany—Reinhard Heydrich—during Operation Anthropoid, accomplished by Czechoslovak national heroes Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. Hitler ordered bloody reprisals.[59]\n\nIn February 1945, Prague suffered several bombing raids by the US Army Air Forces. 701 people were killed, more than 1,000 people were injured and some buildings, factories and historic landmarks (Emmaus Monastery, Faust House, Vinohrady Synagogue) were destroyed.[60] Many historic structures in Prague, however, escaped the destruction of the war and the damage was small compared to the total destruction of many other cities in that time. According to American pilots, it was the result of a navigational mistake. In March, a deliberate raid targeted military factories in Prague, killing about 370 people.[61]\n\nOn 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an uprising against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. Fought concurrently with the Prague uprising, the Prague offensive significantly helped the liberation of Czechoslovakia. At daybreak on 9 May, the 3rd Shock Army of the Red Army took the capital city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of Prague either fled or were expelled by the Beneš decrees in the aftermath of the war.\n\nPrague was a city in a country under the military, economic, and political control of the Soviet Union (see Iron Curtain and COMECON). The world's largest Stalin Monument was unveiled on Letná hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962. The 4th Czechoslovak Writers' Congress, held in the city in June 1967, took a strong position against the regime.[62] On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at Strahov. This spurred the new secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Alexander Dubček, to proclaim a new deal in his city's and country's life, starting the short-lived season of the \"socialism with a human face\". It was the Prague Spring, which aimed at the renovation of political institutions in a democratic way. The other Warsaw Pact member countries, except Romania and Albania, were led by the Soviet Union to repress these reforms through the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the capital, Prague, on 21 August 1968. The invasion, chiefly by infantry and tanks, effectively suppressed any further attempts at reform. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army would end only in 1991. Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc committed suicide by self-immolation in January and February 1969 to protest against the \"normalization\" of the country.\n\nIn 1989, after riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the Velvet Revolution crowded the streets of Prague, and the capital of Czechoslovakia benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1992, the Historic Centre of Prague and its monuments were inscribed as a cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1993, after the Velvet Divorce, Prague became the capital city of the new Czech Republic. Since the 1990s, high-rise buildings began to be built in Prague in large quantities. In the late 1990s, Prague again became an important cultural center of Europe and was notably influenced by globalisation.[63] In 2000, the IMF and World Bank summits took place in Prague and anti-globalization riots took place here. In 2002, Prague suffered from widespread floods that damaged buildings and its underground transport system.\n\nPrague launched a bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics,[64] but failed to make the candidate city shortlist. In June 2009, as the result of financial pressures from the global recession, Prague's officials chose to cancel the city's planned bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[65]\n\nOn 21 December 2023, a mass shooting took place at Charles University in central Prague. In total, 15 people were killed and 25 injured. It was the deadliest mass murder in the history of the Czech Republic.[66]\n\nPrague is situated on the Vltava river. The Berounka flows into the Vltava in the suburbs of Lahovice. There are 99 watercourses in Prague with a total length of 340 km (210 mi). The longest streams are Rokytka and Botič.[67]\n\nThere are 3 reservoirs, 37 ponds, and 34 retention reservoirs and dry polders in the city. The largest pond is Velký Počernický with 41.76 ha (103.2 acres).[67] The largest body of water is Hostivař Reservoir with 42 hectares (103.8 acres).[68]\n\nIn terms of geomorphological division, most of Prague is located in the Prague Plateau. In the south the city's territory extends into the Hořovice Uplands, in the north it extends into the Central Elbe Table lowland. The highest point is the top of the hill Teleček on the western border of Prague, at 399 m (1,309 ft) above sea level. Notable hills in the centre of Prague are Petřín with 327 m (1,073 ft) and Vítkov with 270 m (890 ft). The lowest point is the Vltava in Suchdol at the place where it leaves the city, at 172 m (564 ft).[69]\n\nPrague is located approximately at 50°5′N 14°25′E﻿ / ﻿50.083°N 14.417°E﻿ / 50.083; 14.417. Prague is approximately at the same latitude as Frankfurt, Germany;[70] Paris, France;[71] and Vancouver, Canada.[72] The northernmost point is at 50°10′39″N 14°31′37″E﻿ / ﻿50.17750°N 14.52694°E﻿ / 50.17750; 14.52694, the southernmost point is at 49°56′31″N 14°23′44″E﻿ / ﻿49.94194°N 14.39556°E﻿ / 49.94194; 14.39556, the westernmost point is at 50°6′14″N 14°13′31″E﻿ / ﻿50.10389°N 14.22528°E﻿ / 50.10389; 14.22528, and the easternmost point is at 50°5′14″N 14°42′23″E﻿ / ﻿50.08722°N 14.70639°E﻿ / 50.08722; 14.70639.[73] Farthest geographical points of the city territory are marked physically by so called „Prague Poles\".\n\nPrague has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb; Trewartha: Dobk)[74][75] bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb), defined as such by the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm.[76] The winters are relatively cold with average temperatures at about freezing point (0 °C), and with very little sunshine. Snow cover can be common between mid-November and late March although snow accumulations of more than 200 mm (8 in) are infrequent. There are also a few periods of mild temperatures in winter. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and the average high temperature of 24 °C (75 °F). Nights can be quite cool even in summer, though. Precipitation in Prague is moderate (600–500 mm or 24–20 in per year) since it is located in the rain shadow of the Sudetes and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in the form of thundershowers. The number of hours of average sunshine has increased over time. Temperature inversions are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of 16 km/h (10 mph) that often helps break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold months.\n\nPrague is the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory city, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemian Region.\n\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. Cadastral area (for example, Vinohrady and Smíchov) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\n\nPrague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1–10), 22 administrative districts (1–22), 57 municipal parts, and 112 cadastral areas.\n\nPrague is administered by the autonomous Prague City Assembly, which consists of 65 members and is elected through municipal elections. As of Dec. 20, 18 members of the council were from the centre-right Together Prague group, which governs the city in conjunction with 12 members of the Pirates (centre to centre-left) and 5 members of the Mayors and Independents group (centre to centre-right).[83][84] Thus, the governing coalition has a comfortable majority in the assembly with 35 of 65 seats. Opposition parties include ANO 2011 (right-wing populist) with 14 members, Prague Together (centre) with 11 votes, Freedom and Direct Democracy (right wing to far-right) with 3 members and, 2 unaffiliated Independents.[84]\n\nThe executive body of Prague, elected by the Assembly, is Prague City Council. The municipal office of Prague is at Prague City Hall and has 11 members, including the mayor. It prepares proposals for the Assembly meetings and ensures that adopted resolutions are fulfilled. The Mayor of Prague is Civic Democratic Party member Bohuslav Svoboda.\n\nEven though the official population of Prague hovers around 1.3 million as of the 2011 census, the city's real population is much higher due to only 65% of its residents being marked as permanently living in the city.[85] Data taken from mobile phone movements around the city suggest that the real population of Prague is closer to 1.9 or 2.0 million, with an additional 300,000 to 400,000 commuters coming to the city on weekdays for work, education, or commerce.[86]\n\nAbout 14% of the city's inhabitants were born outside the Czech Republic, the highest proportion in the country. However, 64.8% of the city's population self-identified as ethnically Czech, which is slightly higher than the national average of 63.7%. Almost 29% of respondents declined to answer the question on ethnicity at all, so it may be assumed that the real percentage of ethnic Czechs in Prague is considerably higher. The largest ethnic minority are Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians and Russians.[87]\n\nPrague's population is the oldest and best-educated in the country. It has the lowest proportion of children. Only 10.8% of census respondents claimed adherence to a religion; the majority of these were Roman Catholics.[87]\n\nDevelopment of the Prague population since 1378[88] (since 1869 according to the censuses within the limits of present-day Prague):[89][90]\n\nAs of 30 September 2024, there were 349,317 foreign residents in Prague, of which 128,615 with permanent residence in Prague. The following nationalities are the most numerous:[91]\n\nThe city is traditionally one of the cultural centres of Europe, hosting many cultural events. Some of the significant cultural institutions include the National Theatre (Národní Divadlo) and the Estates Theatre (Stavovské or Tylovo or Nosticovo divadlo), where the premières of Mozart's Don Giovanni and La clemenza di Tito were held. Other major cultural institutions are the Rudolfinum which is home to the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra and the Municipal House which is home to the Prague Symphony Orchestra. The Prague State Opera (Státní opera) performs at the Smetana Theatre.\n\nThe city has many world-class museums, including the National Museum (Národní muzeum), the Museum of the Capital City of Prague, the Jewish Museum in Prague, the Alfons Mucha Museum, the Prague Postal Museum, the African-Prague Museum, the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, the Náprstek Museum (Náprstkovo Muzeum), the Josef Sudek Gallery and The Josef Sudek Studio, the National Library, the National Gallery, which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic and the Kunsthalle Praha, the newest museum in the city.[92]\n\nThere are hundreds of concert halls, galleries, cinemas and music clubs in the city. It hosts music festivals including the Prague Spring International Music Festival, the Prague Autumn International Music Festival, the Prague International Organ Festival, the Dvořák Prague International Music Festival,[93] and the Prague International Jazz Festival. Film festivals include Bohemia Film Awards, the Febiofest, the One World Film Festival and Echoes of the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. The city also hosts the Prague Writers' Festival, the Prague Folklore Days, Prague Advent Choral Meeting the Summer Shakespeare Festival,[94] the Prague Fringe Festival, the World Roma Festival, as well as the hundreds of Vernissages and fashion shows.\n\nWith the growth of low-cost airlines in Europe, Prague has become a weekend city destination allowing tourists to visit its museums and cultural sites as well as try its Czech beers and cuisine.\n\nThe city has many buildings by renowned architects, including Adolf Loos (Villa Müller), Frank O. Gehry (Dancing House) and Jean Nouvel (Golden Angel).\n\nThe early 1912 silent drama film Pro peníze was filmed mostly in Prague. Many films have been afterwards made at Barrandov Studios and at Prague Studios. Hollywood films produced in Prague include Mission Impossible, Dungeons and Dragons, xXx, Blade II, Children of Dune, Alien vs. Predator, Doom, Chronicles of Narnia, Hellboy, EuroTrip, Van Helsing, Red Tails, and Spider-Man: Far From Home.[95] Many Indian films have also been filmed in the city including Yuvvraaj, Drona and Rockstar, Jab Harry Met Sejal, Bang Bang, Duplicate and many more.[96]\n\nAmong the most famous foreign music videos filmed in Prague are: Never Tear Us Apart by INXS, Some Things by Lasgo, Silver and Cold by AFI, Diamonds from Sierra Leone by Kanye West, Don't Stop the Music by Rihanna and Numb by Linkin Park.\n\nVideo games set in Prague include Osman, Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption, Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix, Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness, Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon, Still Life, Metal Gear Solid 4, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, Forza Motorsport 5, 6 and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided.\n\nHistorical fiction novels: The Discovery of Witches, Shadows of Night by Deborah Harkness\n\nIn 2008, the Allegro restaurant received the first Michelin star in the whole of the post-Communist part of Central Europe. It retained its star until 2011. As of 2018 , there were just two Michelin-starred restaurants in Prague: La Degustation Bohême Bourgeoise and Field. Another six have been awarded Michelin's Bib Gourmand: Bistrøt 104, Divinis, Eska, Maso a Kobliha, Na Kopci and Sansho. However, as of 2022, there are 27 Michelin-starred restaurants in Prague which still include La Degustation Bohême Bourgeoise and Field.\n\nCzech beer has a long history, with brewing taking place in Břevnov Monastery in 993. In Old Town, Žižkov and Vinohrady there are hundreds of restaurants, bars and pubs, especially with Czech beer. Prague also hosts several microbrewery festivals throughout the year. The city is home to historical breweries Staropramen (Praha 5), U Fleků, U Medvídků, U Tří růží, Strahov Monastery Brewery (Praha 1) and Břevnov Monastery Brewery (Praha 6). Among many microbreweries are: Novoměstský, Pražský most u Valšů, Národní, Boršov, Loď pivovar, U Dobřenských, U Dvou koček, U Supa (Praha 1), Pivovarský dům (Praha 2), Sousedský pivovar Bašta (Praha 4), Suchdolský Jeník, Libocký pivovar (Praha 6), Marina (Praha 7), U Bulovky (Praha 8), Beznoska, Kolčavka (Praha 9), Vinohradský pivovar, Zubatý pes, Malešický mikropivovar (Praha 10), Jihoměstský pivovar (Praha 11), Lužiny (Praha 13), Počernický pivovar (Praha 14) and Hostivar (Praha 15).\n\nIn an October 2024 article, Prague was ranked 7th on \"Europe's 10 most beautiful cities to visit in autumn\". The ranking was done by Travelbag and based on analysing Google search and Instagram hashtags.[97]\n\nPrague's economy accounts for 25% of the Czech GDP[98] making it the highest performing regional economy of the country. As of 2021, its GDP per capita in purchasing power standard is €58,216, making it the third best performing region in the EU at 203 per cent of the EU-27 average in 2021.[99]\n\nPrague employs almost a fifth of the entire Czech workforce, and its wages are significantly above average (≈+20%). In 4Q/2020, during the pandemic, average salaries available in Prague reached CZK 45.944 (≈€1,800) per month, an annual increase of 4%, which was nevertheless lower than national increase of 6.5% both in nominal and real terms. (Inflation in the Czech Republic was 3.2% in 4Q/2020.)[100][101] Since 1990, the city's economic structure has shifted from industrial to service-oriented. Industry is present in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, printing, food processing, manufacture of transport equipment, computer technology, and electrical engineering. In the service sector, financial and commercial services, trade, restaurants, hospitality and public administration are the most significant. Services account for around 80 per cent of employment. There are 800,000 employees in Prague, including 120,000 commuters.[98] The number of (legally registered) foreign residents in Prague has been increasing in spite of the country's economic downturn. As of March 2010, 148,035 foreign workers were reported to be living in the city making up about 18 per cent of the workforce, up from 131,132 in 2008.[102] Approximately one-fifth of all investment in the Czech Republic takes place in the city.\n\nAlmost one-half of the national income from tourism is spent in Prague. The city offers approximately 73,000 beds in accommodation facilities, most of which were built after 1990, including almost 51,000 beds in hotels and boarding houses.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to late 2000s, the city was a common filming location for international productions such as Hollywood and Bollywood motion pictures. A combination of architecture, low costs and the existing motion picture infrastructure have proven attractive to international film production companies.\n\nThe modern economy of Prague is largely service and export-based and, in a 2010 survey, the city was named the best city in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) for business.[103]\n\nIn 2005, Prague was deemed among the three best cities in Central and Eastern Europe according to The Economist's livability rankings.[104] The city was named as a top-tier nexus city for innovation across multiple sectors of the global innovation economy, placing 29th globally out of 289 cities, ahead of Brussels and Helsinki for innovation in 2010.[105]\n\nNa příkopě is the most expensive street among all the states of the V4.[106] In 2017, with the amount of rent €2,640 (CZK 67,480) per square meter per year, ranked on 22nd place among the most expensive streets in the world.[107] The second most expensive is Pařížská street.\n\nIn the Eurostat research, Prague ranked fifth among Europe's 271 regions in terms of gross domestic product per inhabitant, achieving 172 per cent of the EU average. It ranked just above Paris and well above the country as a whole, which achieved 80 per cent of the EU average.[108][109]\n\nCompanies with highest turnover in the region in 2014:[110]\n\nPrague is also the site of some of the most important offices and institutions of the Czech Republic\n• The Government and both houses of Parliament\n• Ministries and other national offices (Industrial Property Office, Czech Statistical Office, National Security Authority, etc.)\n• Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic\n\nSince the fall of the Iron Curtain, Prague has become one of the world's most popular tourist destinations. Prague suffered considerably less damage during World War II than some other major cities in the region, allowing most of its historic architecture to stay true to form. It contains one of the world's most pristine and varied collections of architecture, from Romanesque, to Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau, Cubist, Neo-Classical and ultra-modern.\n\nPrague is classified as an \"Beta+\" global city according to GaWC studies, comparable to Vienna, Manila and Washington, D.C.[111] Prague ranked sixth in the Tripadvisor world list of best destinations in 2016.[112] Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination, and the city receives more than 8.4 million international visitors annually, as of 2017 . Furthermore, the city was ranked 7th in the world ICCA Destination Performance Index measuring performance of conference tourism in 2021.[113] As of December 2024 the city is ranked 3rd among the best places to visit during Christmas.[114]\n• The Charles Bridge is a historic bridge from the 14th century.\n• is the biggest ancient castle in the world. is the biggest ancient castle in the world.

In 2023, Prague was visited by 7,442,614 guests who stayed overnight, of which 78.8% were from abroad. Average number of overnight stays of non-residents was 2.3. Most non-residents arriving to Prague and staying overnight were from the following countries:[121]\n\nIn 2023, the most visited tourist destinations of Prague were:[122]\n\nNine public universities and thirty six private universities are located in the city, including:[123]\n• The University of Finance and Administration (VSFS) founded in 1999\n\nThe region city of Prague is an important centre of research. It is the seat of 39 out of 54 institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, including the largest ones, the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Microbiology and the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry. It is also a seat of 10 public research institutes, four business incubators and large hospitals performing research and development activities such as the Motol University Hospital or Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, which was the largest transplant center in Europe as of 2019.[124] Universities seated in Prague (see section Colleges and Universities) also represent important centres of science and research activities.\n\nAs of 2008 , there were 13,000 researchers (out of 30,000 in the country, counted in full-time equivalents), representing a 3% share of Prague's economically active population. Gross expenditure on research and development accounted for €901.3 million (41.5% of country's total).[125]\n\nSome well-known multinational companies have established research and development facilities in Prague, among them Siemens, Honeywell, Oracle, Microsoft and Broadcom.\n\nPrague was selected to host administration of the EU satellite navigation system Galileo. It started to provide its first services in December 2016 and full completion is expected by 2020.\n\nAs of 2017 , Prague's transport modal share by journey was 52% public transport, 24.5% by car, 22.4% on foot, 0.4% by bicycle and 0.5% by aeroplane.[126]\n\nThe public transport infrastructure consists of the heavily used Prague Integrated Transport (PID, Pražská integrovaná doprava) system, consisting of the Prague Metro (lines A, B, and C – its length is 65 km (40 mi) with 61 stations in total), Prague tram system, Prague buses service, commuter trains, funiculars, and seven ferries. Prague has one of the highest rates of public transport usage in the world,[127] with 1.2 billion passenger journeys per year.\n\nPrague has about 300 bus lines (numbers 100–960) and 34 regular tram lines (numbers 1–26 and 91–99). As of 2022 the bus lines are being extended with trolley bus lines.\n\nThere are also three funiculars, the Petřín funicular on Petřín Hill, one on Mrázovka Hill and a third at the Zoo in Troja.\n\nThe Prague tram system now operates various types of trams, including the Tatra T3, newer Tatra KT8D5, Škoda 14 T (designed by Porsche), newer modern Škoda 15 T and nostalgic tram lines 23 and 41. Around 400 vehicles are the modernized T3 class, which are typically operated coupled together in pairs.\n\nThe Prague tram system is the twelfth longest in the world (144 km) and its rolling stock consists of 786 individual cars,[128] which is the largest in the world. The system carries more than 360 million passengers annually, the highest tram patronage in the world after Budapest, on a per capita basis, Prague has the second highest tram patronage after Zürich.\n\nAll services (metro, tramways, city buses, funiculars and ferries) have a common ticketing system that operates on a proof-of-payment system. Basic transfer tickets can be bought for 30 and 90-minute rides, short-term tourist passes are available for periods of 24 hours or 3 days, and longer-term tickets can be bought on the smart ticketing system Lítačka, for periods of one month, three months or one year.[129] Since August 2021, people up to the age of 14 and over 65 can use Prague's public transport free of charge (proof of age is required). Persons between 15 and 18 years and between 60 and 64 years pay half price for single tickets and day tickets.\n\nServices are run by the Prague Public Transport Company and several other companies. Since 2005 the Regional Organiser of Prague Integrated Transport (ROPID) has franchised operation of ferries on the Vltava river, which are also a part of the public transport system with common fares. Taxi services make pick-ups on the streets or operate from regulated taxi stands.\n\nThe Metro has three major lines extending throughout the city: A (green), B (yellow) and C (red). A fourth Metro line D is under construction, which will connect the city centre to southern parts of the city (as of 2022, the completion is expected in 2028).[130][131] The Prague Metro system served 589.2 million passengers in 2012,[132] making it the fifth busiest metro system in Europe and the most-patronised in the world on a per capita basis. The first section of the Prague metro was put into operation in 1974. It was the stretch between stations Kačerov and Florenc on the current line C. The first part of Line A was opened in 1978 (Dejvická – Náměstí Míru), the first part of line B in 1985 (Anděl – Florenc).\n\nIn April 2015, construction finished to extend the green line A further into the northwest corner of Prague closer to the airport.[133] A new interchange station for the bus in the direction of the airport is the station Nádraží Veleslavín. The final station of the green line is Nemocnice Motol (Motol Hospital), giving people direct public transportation access to the largest medical facility in the Czech Republic and one of the largest in Europe. A railway connection to the airport is planned.\n\nIn operation there are two kinds of units: \"81-71M\" which is modernized variant of the Soviet Metrovagonmash 81-71 (completely modernized between 1995 and 2003) and new \"Metro M1\" trains (since 2000), manufactured by consortium consisting of Siemens, ČKD Praha and ADtranz. The minimum interval between two trains is 90 seconds.\n\nThe original Soviet vehicles \"Ečs\" were excluded in 1997, but one vehicle is placed in public transport museum in depot Střešovice.[134] The Náměstí Míru metro station is the deepest station and is equipped with the longest escalator in European Union. The Prague metro is generally considered very safe.\n\nThe main flow of traffic leads through the centre of the city and through inner and outer ring roads (partially in operation).\n• Inner Ring Road (The City Ring \"MO\"): surrounds central Prague. It is the longest city tunnel in Europe with a length of 5.5 km (3.4 mi) and five interchanges has been completed to relieve congestion in the north-western part of Prague. Called Blanka tunnel complex and part of the City Ring Road, it was estimated to eventually cost (after several increases) CZK 43 billion. Construction started in 2007 and, after repeated delays, the tunnel officially opened in September 2015. This tunnel complex completes a major part of the inner ring road.\n• Outer Ring Road (The Prague Ring \"D0\"): this ring road will connect all major motorways and speedways that meet each other in Prague region and provide faster transit without a necessity to drive through the city. So far 39 km (24 mi), out of a total planned 83 km (52 mi), is in operation. Most recently, the southern part of this road (with a length of more than 20 km (12 mi)) was opened on 22 September 2010. 135 As of 2021, the next 12 km (7 mi) section between Modletice and Běchovice is planned to be completed in 2025. 136\n\nThe city forms the hub of the Czech railway system, with services to all parts of the country and abroad. The railway system links Prague with major European cities (which can be reached without transfers), including Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, Regensburg and Munich (Germany); Vienna, Graz and Linz (Austria); Warsaw, Kraków and Przemyśl (Poland); Bratislava, Poprad and Košice (Slovakia); Budapest (Hungary); Basel and Zürich (Switzerland). Travel times range between 2 hours to Dresden and 13 hours to Zürich.[137]\n\nPrague's main international railway station is Hlavní nádraží,[138] rail services are also available from other main stations: Masarykovo nádraží, Holešovice and Smíchov, in addition to suburban stations. Commuter rail services operate under the name Esko Praha, which is part of PID (Prague Integrated Transport).\n\nPrague is served by Václav Havel Airport Prague, the largest airport in the Czech Republic and one of the largest and busiest airports in central and eastern Europe. The airport is the hub of carriers Smartwings and Czech Airlines operating throughout Europe. Other airports in Prague include the city's original airport in the north-eastern district of Kbely, which is serviced by the Czech Air Force, also internationally. It also houses the Prague Aviation Museum. The nearby Letňany Airport is mainly used for private aviation and aeroclub aviation. Another airport in the proximity is Aero Vodochody aircraft factory to the north, used for testing purposes, as well as for aeroclub aviation. There are a few aeroclubs around Prague, such as the Točná airfield.\n\nIn 2018, 1–2.5 % of people commute by bike in Prague, depending on season. Cycling is very common as a sport or recreation.[139] As of 2019, there were 194 km (121 mi) of protected cycle paths and routes. Also, there were 50 km (31 mi) of bike lanes and 26 km (16 mi) of specially marked bus lanes that are free to be used by cyclists.[140] As of 2024, there are four companies providing bicycle sharing in Prague: Rekola (1,000 bikes), Nextbike (1,000 bikes), Bolt and Lime. Bikesharing is partly connected to the public transportation and subsidised by the city.\n\nPrague is the site of many sports events, national stadiums and teams.\n• O2 Arena – the second largest ice hockey arena in Europe. It hosted 2004 and 2015 Ice Hockey World Championship, NHL 2008 and 2010 Opening Game and Euroleague Final Four.\n• Strahov Stadium – the largest stadium in the world. 141\n• Gutovka– sport area with a large concrete skatepark, the highest outdoor climbing wall in Central Europe, four beach volleyball courts and children's playground; 142 Central European Beach Volleyball Championship 2018 took place here.\n• Mystic SK8 Cup – World Cup of Skateboarding venue held at the Štvanice skatepark\n\nThe city of Prague maintains its own EU delegation in Brussels called Prague House.[144]\n\nPrague was the location of U.S. President Barack Obama's speech on 5 April 2009, which led to the New START treaty with Russia, signed in Prague on 8 April 2010.[145]\n\nThe annual conference Forum 2000, which was founded by former Czech President Václav Havel, Japanese philanthropist Yōhei Sasakawa, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel in 1996, is held in Prague. Its main objective is \"to identify the key issues facing civilization and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components\", and also intends to promote democracy in non-democratic countries and to support civil society. Conferences have attracted a number of prominent thinkers, Nobel laureates, former and acting politicians, business leaders and other individuals like: Frederik Willem de Klerk, Bill Clinton, Nicholas Winton, Oscar Arias Sánchez, Dalai Lama, Hans Küng, Shimon Peres and Madeleine Albright.\n\nA number of other settlements are derived or similar to the name of Prague. In many of these cases, Czech emigration has left a number of namesake cities scattered over the globe, with a notable concentration in the New World.\n\nAdditionally, Kłodzko is sometimes referred to as \"Little Prague\" (German: Klein-Prag). Although now in Poland, it had been traditionally a part of Bohemia until 1763 when it became part of Silesia.[160]\n• Old maps of Prague Archived 26 July 2022 at the Wayback Machine in Historic Cities siteJeštěd - Wikipedia: Ještěd (Czech pronunciation: [ˈjɛʃcɛt]; German: Jeschken) is the highest mountain of the Ještěd–Kozákov Ridge in the north of the Czech Republic, at 1,012 m (3,320 ft). It is the symbol of the city of Liberec.\n\nOn the summit is the Ještěd Tower restaurant, hotel and television tower, designed by Karel Hubáček,[1] accessible by road or cable car (Ještěd cable car). The mountain also has a ski resort. From the summit there are views to Germany and Poland.\n\nThe name was probably derived from the connection of the Old German words ask and ket, meaning \"ash hill\" or \"ash forest\". The Slavic name was created by gradual distortion.[2] The Czech name for the mountain was first recorded in 1545 as Jesstied. The German form of the name, Jeschken, was first mentioned in 1565.\n\nJeštěd is the highest mountain of the Ještěd–Kozákov Ridge within the Bohemian Massif. The eastern slopes and the summit lie in the municipal territory of Liberec (Horní Hanychov part), the western slopes belong to the municipality of Světlá pod Ještědem.\n\nAs far back as 1838 the summit hosted a crude stone that serves as a landmark to this day. The first hut on the summit was erected as early as 1844. In the 1860s, the mountain ridge was Station No. 4 of the first order of the Royal Saxon triangulation. For this reason a measuring station was built on the summit.\n\nIn 1906, the Mountain Club, a mountain hotel, was built. The Jeschke Horní Hanychov cable car to the summit was opened in 1933.\n\nOn 23 August 1940, at midnight, a Heinkel He 111 from the Second (Lion) Squadron (German: Löwengeschwader) from Lüneburg crashed into the mountain near the summit and tore a long swathe in the woods. This accident killed the four crew.\n\nThe old mountain hotel burned down in 1963.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1973, a futuristic hotel, with a 100-metre-high television tower, was built that was designed by the architect, Karel Hubáček. For the construction of the TV tower, Hubáček was awarded the Auguste Perret Prize. The modern building acts as an observation tower, transmission tower, hotel and restaurant.\n\nIn 2009, an element of the Nordic World Ski Championships took place on Ještěd.\n\nIn Ještěd there are two ski jumping hills, The World Championships 2009 were hosted there. The K-134 and the K-90. Roman Koudelka has the hill record in the K-134, with 143 metres. Anssi Koivuranta jumped 106.5 metres in the K-90, which is the hill record on this hill."}

The aim of ongoing, NIH funded projects is to reveal how inflammation associated with tumor growth modulates T cell functions in tumors. In particular, we investigate the involvement of connexin 43 and Bone Morphogenic Protein Receptor 1α in the generation of regulatory CD4+ T cells in the thymus and in the interplay between stromal cells and components of the innate and adaptive immune system in a mouse model of prostate cancer. The goal of our studies is to reveal and exploit novel mechanisms of immune regulation to overcome challenges facing immunotherapies of cancer.Barbara Kraj: Enhance your college career by gaining relevant experience with the skills and knowledge needed for your future career.

It has about 3,500 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.\n\nBřeznice consists of six municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):[2]\n\nThe name of the town is probably derived from Březná, which was the former name of the stream that flowed through the birch forest (from the Czech word bříza, i.e. 'birch').[3]\n\nBřeznice is located about 13 kilometres (8 mi) south of Příbram and 61 km (38 mi) southwest of Prague. It lies in the Benešov Uplands. The highest point is the hill Vinice at 538 m (1,765 ft) above sea level. The Skalice River flows through the town.\n\nThe first written mention of Březnice is from 1224, when Budislav of Březnice, a member of the royal council, was documented. In 1327, Březnice was first referred to as a market town. Until the Battle of the White Mountain, it was a small market town. In 1621, Březnice was acquired by Přibík Jeníšek of Újezd, who together with his wife started the construction development, founded a Jesuit college and had a new church built.[4]\n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the town was not damaged much, and continued to develop after the war, especially in the 18th century. The Jewish ghetto was founded in 1726. In 1728, Březnice was inherited by the Kolowrat family. In 1872, the town was inherited by the Pálffy family, who owned it until 1945. For centuries, Březnice was an agricultural town. In 1875, the railway was built, and industry began to develop slowly. Between 1918 and 1931, several factories were established.[4]\n\nBřeznice is home to the Březnice Castle Brewery, which sells its beer under the Herold brand name.\n\nThe I/19 road from Plzeň to Tábor passes through the town.\n\nBřeznice is located on the major railway line Prague–České Budějovice and on the line Beroun–Blatná.[7]\n\nBřeznice is known for the Březnice Castle, protected as a national cultural heritage. It was built in the 13th century. The castle is surrounded by a Renaissance garden and English landscape garden. Historically significant is its library from 1558, one of the oldest in Bohemia. The castle is open to the public.[8]\n\nThe Church of Saints Francis Xavier and Ignatius of Loyola is a landmark of historical town centre. It was built by Carlo Lurago in 1642–1650. It includes many valuable paintings and carved sculptures.[9]\n\nThe Jewish ghetto is a unique urban complex with preserved Neoclassical houses. The synagogue was built in 1726–1728 and rebuilt in 1874. Březnice served as an important cultural and social centre for Jewish population in a wide area. There is also a Jewish cemetery in the town.[10]"}

Over the centuries that followed, however, the Roman Rite in Ecclesiastical Latin, which is less easily understood than Slavonic by native speakers of Old Czech, was imposed upon the Czech people despite considerable public resistance, by German-speaking bishops, beginning with Wiching, from the Holy Roman Empire. (See also Sázava Monastery).[1] As a cultural memory of both communion in both kinds and the Divine Liturgy in a language closer to the vernacular is believed to have survived well into the Renaissance, the ideas of Jan Hus and others like him swiftly gained a wide public following. After the trial and execution of Hus at the Council of Constance,[2] a series of crusades, civil wars, victories and compromises between various factions with different theological agendas broke out. At the end of the Hussite Wars (1420–1434), the now Catholic-supported Utraquist side came out victorious from protracted conflict against Jan Žižka and the Taborites, who embraced the more radical theological teachings of John Wycliffe and the Lollards, and became the dominant Hussite group in Bohemia.\n\nCatholics and Utraquists were given legal equality in Bohemia after the religious peace of Kutná Hora in 1485. Bohemia and Moravia, or what is now the territory of the Czech Republic, remained majority Hussite for two centuries. Roman Catholicism was only reimposed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II following the 1620 Battle of White Mountain and during the Thirty Years' War.\n\nThe Hussite tradition continues in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren and, since the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, by the re-founded Czechoslovak Hussite Church.[3] The revived legacy of Sts Cyril and Methodius also continues in both the Orthodox Church in the Czech Lands and the Apostolic Exarchate of the Greek Catholic Church in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe Hussite movement began in the Kingdom of Bohemia and quickly spread throughout the remaining Lands of the Bohemian Crown, including Moravia and Silesia. It also made inroads into the northern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary (now Slovakia), but was rejected and gained infamy for the plundering behaviour of the Hussite soldiers.[4][5][6][7] There were also very small temporary communities in Poland-Lithuania and Transylvania which moved to Bohemia after being confronted with religious intolerance. It was a regional movement that failed to expand farther. Hussites emerged as a majority Utraquist movement with a significant Taborite faction, and smaller regional ones that included Adamites, Orebites and Orphans.\n\nMajor Hussite theologians included Petr Chelčický, Jerome of Prague. A number of Czech national heroes were Hussite, including Jan Žižka, who led a fierce resistance to five consecutive crusades proclaimed on Hussite Bohemia by the Papacy. Hussites were one of the most important forerunners of the Protestant Reformation. This predominantly religious movement was propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness.\n\nThe Council of Constance lured Jan Hus in with a letter of indemnity, then tried him for heresy and put him to death at the stake on 6 July 1415.[2]\n\nThe arrest of Hus in 1414 caused considerable resentment in Czech lands. The authorities of both countries appealed urgently and repeatedly to King Sigismund to release Jan Hus.\n\nWhen news of his death at the Council of Constance arrived, disturbances broke out, directed primarily against the clergy and especially against the monks. Even the Archbishop narrowly escaped from the effects of this popular anger. The treatment of Hus was felt to be a disgrace inflicted upon the whole country and his death was seen as a criminal act. King Wenceslaus IV., prompted by his grudge against Sigismund, at first gave free vent to his indignation at the course of events in Constance. His wife openly favoured the friends of Hus. Avowed Hussites stood at the head of the government.\n\nA league was formed by certain lords,[who?] who pledged themselves to protect the free preaching of the Gospel upon all their possessions and estates and to obey the power of the Bishops only where their orders accorded with the injunctions of the Bible. The university would arbitrate any disputed points. The entire Hussite nobility joined the league. Other than verbal protest of the council's treatment of Hus, there was little evidence of any actions taken by the nobility until 1417. At that point several of the lesser nobility and some barons, signatories of the 1415 protest letter, removed Catholic priests from their parishes, replacing them with priests willing to give communion in both wine and bread. The chalice of wine became the central identifying symbol of the Hussite movement.[8] If the king had joined, its resolutions would have received the sanction of the law; but he refused, and approached the newly formed Roman Catholic League of lords, whose members pledged themselves to support the king, the Catholic Church, and the council. The prospect of a civil war began to emerge.\n\nPrior to becoming pope, Martin V, then known as Cardinal Otto of Colonna had attacked Hus with relentless severity. He energetically resumed the battle against Hus's teaching after the enactments of the Council of Constance. He wished to eradicate completely the doctrine of Hus, for which purpose the co-operation of King Wenceslaus had to be obtained.[citation needed] In 1418, Sigismund succeeded in winning his brother over to the standpoint of the council by pointing out the inevitability of a religious war if the heretics in Bohemia found further protection.[citation needed] Hussite statesmen and army leaders had to leave the country and Roman Catholic priests were reinstated. These measures caused a general commotion which hastened the death of King Wenceslaus by a paralytic stroke in 1419.[citation needed] His heir was Sigismund.\n\nThe news of the death of King Wenceslaus in 1419 produced a great commotion among the people of Prague. A revolution swept over the country: churches and monasteries were destroyed, and church property was seized by the Hussite nobility. It was then, and remained till much later, in question whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (Čeněk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund's claim to not be accepted. Sigismund could get possession of \"his\" kingdom only by force of arms. Pope Martin V called upon Catholics of the West to take up arms against the Hussites, declaring a crusade, and twelve years of warfare followed.\n\nThe Hussites initially campaigned defensively, but after 1427 they assumed the offensive. Apart from their religious aims, they fought for the national interests of the Czechs. The moderate and radical parties were united, and they not only repelled the attacks of the army of crusaders but crossed the borders into neighboring countries. On March 23, 1430, Joan of Arc dictated a letter[9] that threatened to lead a crusading army against the Hussites unless they returned to the Catholic faith, but her capture by English and Burgundian troops two months later would keep her from carrying out this threat.\n\nEventually, the opponents of the Hussites found themselves forced to consider an amicable settlement. The Hussites were sent an invitation to attend the ecumenical Council of Basel on October 15, 1431.[10] The discussions began on 10 January 1432, focusing chiefly on the four articles of Prague. No agreement emerged. After repeated negotiations between the Basel Council and Bohemia, a Bohemian–Moravian state assembly in Prague accepted the \"Compactata\" of Prague on 30 November 1433. The agreement granted communion in both kinds to all who desired it, but with the understanding that Christ was entirely present in each kind, though on the condition that the rest of the Hussite reforms would no longer be emphasised.[10] Free preaching was granted conditionally: the Church hierarchy had to approve and place priests, and the power of the bishop must be considered. The article which prohibited the secular power of the clergy was almost reversed.\n\nThe Taborites refused to conform. The Calixtines united with the Roman Catholics and destroyed the Taborites at the Battle of Lipany on 30 May 1434.[11] From that time, the Taborites lost their importance, though the Hussite movement would continue in Poland for another five years, until the Royalist forces of Poland defeated the Polish Hussites at the Battle of Grotniki. The state assembly of Jihlava in 1436 confirmed the \"Compactata\" and gave them the sanction of law. This accomplished the reconciliation of Bohemia with Rome and the Western Church, and at last Sigismund obtained possession of the Bohemian crown.[11] His reactionary measures caused a ferment in the whole country, but he died in 1437. The state assembly in Prague rejected Wyclif's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which was obnoxious to the Utraquists, as heresy in 1444. Most of the Taborites now went over to the party of the Utraquists; the rest joined the \"Brothers of the Law of Christ\" (Latin: \"Unitas Fratrum\") (see history of the Moravian Church).\n\nIn 1462, Pope Pius II declared the \"Compacta\" null and void, prohibited communion in both kinds, and acknowledged King George of Podebrady as king on condition that he would promise an unconditional harmony with the Roman Church. This he refused, leading to the Bohemian–Hungarian War (1468–1478). His successor, King Vladislaus II, favored the Roman Catholics and proceeded against some zealous clergymen of the Calixtines. The troubles of the Utraquists increased from year to year. In 1485, at the Diet of Kutná Hora, an agreement was made between the Roman Catholics and Utraquists that lasted for thirty-one years. It was only later, at the Diet of 1512, that the equal rights of both religions were permanently established. The appearance of Martin Luther was hailed by the Utraquist clergy, and Luther himself was astonished to find so many points of agreement between the doctrines of Hus and his own. But not all Utraquists approved of the German Reformation; a schism arose among them, and many returned to the Roman doctrine, while other elements had organised the \"Unitas Fratrum\" already in 1457.\n\nUnder Emperor Maximilian II, the Bohemian state assembly established the Confessio Bohemica, upon which Lutherans, Reformed, and Bohemian Brethren agreed. From that time forward Hussitism began to die out. After the Battle of White Mountain on 8 November 1620 the Roman Catholic Faith was re-established with vigour, which fundamentally changed the religious conditions of the Czech lands.\n\nLeaders and members of Unitas Fratrum were forced to choose to either leave the many and varied southeastern principalities of what was the Holy Roman Empire (mainly Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, Moravia and parts of Germany and its many states), or to practice their beliefs secretly. As a result, members were forced underground and dispersed across northwestern Europe. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in Lissa (Leszno) in Poland, which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and in small, isolated groups in Moravia. Some, among them Jan Amos Comenius, fled to western Europe, mainly the Low Countries. A settlement of Hussites in Herrnhut, Saxony, now Germany, in 1722 caused the emergence of the Moravian Church.\n\nIn 1918, as a result of World War I, the Czech lands regained independence from Austria-Hungary controlled by the Habsburg monarchy as Czechoslovakia (due to Masaryk and Czechoslovak legions with Hussite tradition, in the name of the troops).[12]\n\nToday, the Hussite tradition is represented in the Moravian Church, Unity of the Brethren, and Czechoslovak Hussite Church.[3][13]\n\nHussitism organised itself during the years 1415–1419. Hussites were not a unitary movement, but a diverse one with multiple factions that held different views and opposed each other in the Hussite Wars. From the beginning, there formed two parties, with a smaller number of people withdrawing from both parties around the pacifist Petr Chelčický, whose teachings would form the foundation of the Unitas Fratrum. Hussites can be divided into:\n\nThe more conservative Hussites (the moderate party, or Utraquists), who followed Hus more closely, sought to conduct reform while leaving the whole hierarchical and liturgical order of the Church untouched.[14]\n\nTheir programme is contained in the Four Articles of Prague, which were written by Jacob of Mies and agreed upon in July 1420, promulgated in the Latin, Czech, and German languages.[15] The full text is about two pages long, but they are often summarized as:[15]\n• Freedom to preach the word of God\n• Celebration of the communion under both kinds (bread and wine to priests and laity alike)\n• Poverty of the clergy and expropriation of church property;\n• Punishment for mortal sins regardless of stature.\n\nThe views of the moderate Hussites were widely represented at the university and among the citizens of Prague; they were therefore called the Prague Party, but also Calixtines (Latin calix chalice) or Utraquists (Latin utraque both), because they emphasized the second article of Prague, and the chalice became their emblem.\n\nThe more radical parties, the Taborites, Orebites and Orphans, identified itself more boldly with the doctrines of John Wycliffe, sharing his passionate hatred of the monastic clergy, and his desire to return the Church to its supposed condition during the time of the apostles. This required the removal of the existing hierarchy and the secularisation of ecclesiastical possessions. Above all they clung to Wycliffe's doctrine of the Lord's Supper, denying transubstantiation,[16] and this is the principal point by which they are distinguished from the moderate party, the Utraquists.\n\nThe radicals preached the \"sufficientia legis Christi\"—the divine law (i.e. the Bible) is the sole rule and canon for human society, not only in the church, but also in political and civil matters. They rejected therefore, as early as 1416, everything that they believed had no basis in the Bible, such as the veneration of saints and images, fasts, superfluous holidays, the oath, intercession for the dead, auricular Confession, indulgences, the sacraments of Confirmation and the Anointing of the Sick, and chose their own priests.\n\nThe radicals had their gathering-places all around the country. Their first armed assault fell on the small town of Ústí, on the river Lužnice, south of Prague (today's Sezimovo Ústí). However, as the place did not prove to be defensible, they settled in the remains of an older town upon a hill not far away and founded a new town, which they named Tábor (a play on words, as \"Tábor\" not only meant \"camp\" or \"encampment\" in Czech,[17] but is also the traditional name of the mountain on which Jesus was expected to return; see Mark 13); hence they were called Táborité (Taborites). They comprised the essential force of the radical Hussites.\n\nTheir aim was to destroy the enemies of the law of God, and to defend his kingdom (which had been expected to come in a short time) by the sword. Their end-of-world visions did not come true. In order to preserve their settlement and spread their ideology, they waged bloody wars; in the beginning they observed a strict regime, inflicting the severest punishment equally for murder, as for less severe faults as adultery, perjury and usury, and also tried to apply rigid Biblical standards to the social order of the time. The Taborites usually had the support of the Orebites (later called Orphans), an eastern Bohemian sect of Hussitism based in Hradec Králové.\n• Michael Van Dussen and Pavel Soukup (eds.). 2020.

Capsular polysaccharides include a remarkably diverse range of chemical structures; for example, more than 80 distinct structures are made by Escherichia coli (2) and more than 90 by Streptococcus pneumoniae (3). Despite this variety, most capsular polysaccharides are assembled by one of the two assembly strategies. This study addresses one of those strategies, which requires a characteristic ABC transporter and is best characterized in the production of E. coli “group 2” capsules (reviewed in (1, 2)).\n\nThe defining feature of E. coli group 2 capsular polysaccharides is a conserved glycolipid terminus comprising (lyso)phosphatidylglycerol modified with a short chain of 3-deoxy-β-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (β-Kdo) residues (4, 5, 6) (Fig. 1A). Its synthesis is performed by two CMP-β-Kdo-dependent glycosyltransferases (GTs). KpsS is a monofunctional GT and initiates capsule synthesis by transferring the initial β-Kdo residue to the phospholipid (5, 7, 8). KpsC, which possesses two β-Kdo GT modules, then extends the KpsS product by assembling an oligosaccharide composed of alternating β-(2→4)- and β-(2→7)-linked Kdo residues. It sequentially transfers a β-(2→7)-linked Kdo residue, using its C-terminal GT module (KpsC-C in the E. coli enzyme), followed by a β-(2→4)-linked Kdo residue, transferred by the N-terminal GT module (KpsC-N ) (5, 7, 9) (Fig. 1B). Unusually, in the thermophile, Thermosulfurimonas dismutans, these two KpsC GT modules exist as separate polypeptides (5, 9). The resulting Kdo-glycosylated lipid appears to be conserved in almost all capsule-assembly systems which use an ABC transporter–dependent assembly strategy in Gram-negative bacteria (1). The Kdo-modified glycolipid serves as an acceptor for serotype-dependent GTs, which generate capsular polysaccharides with diverse carbohydrate structures and antigenic epitopes (1) (Fig. 1B). Once synthesis is completed in the cytoplasm, the polymer product is exported to the surface by a membrane-spanning translocation pathway that includes an ABC transporter and an outer membrane translocon, which are thought to be bridged by a largely periplasmic adapter protein (1, 2). Based on conserved export machinery and KpsS and KpsC enzymes, the same assembly system appears also to be used in important human pathogens including Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and bronchiseptica, Campylobacter jejuni and others (7), as well as in important livestock pathogens such as Mannheimia haemolytica and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (5).\n\nAntibiotic regimens for many pathogens are increasingly compromised by resistance, so other approaches are needed. Vaccines provide one strategy and capsules are the targets of some existing successful vaccines, while others are currently in development (10, 11). However, developing capsule vaccines for some pathogen species is challenging because of the hypervariable carbohydrate structures and, in some instances, their mimicry of host glycans (12). Small-molecule inhibitors of capsule assembly have been proposed as one viable alternative (13). The conservation of KpsS and KpsC means that they present a therapeutic target with the potential to attenuate a broad range of Gram-negative pathogens, where capsules are required for survival in the host. A high-throughput screening assay has been developed for KpsC (14) and the present study is part of an ongoing effort to define the structure–function properties of this enzyme to strengthen the foundation for discovery of small-molecule inhibitors.\n\nGTs catalyze the transfer of sugar residues from activated donors to acceptor substrates, forming glycosidic linkages (reviewed in (15)). In the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database, more than 1 million GT modules from all forms of life are currently assigned to 116 GT families (February, 2023) based on sequence and/or structural similarities (16). KpsC is the founding member of the GT107 family. Despite their incredible functional diversity, the most common GTs involved in the synthesis of bacterial surface polysaccharides are Leloir enzymes, which use nucleotide-sugar donors (such as cytidine-5′-monophospho-β-Kdo) and possess one of two folds—either the GT-A or GT-B fold (reviewed in (15)). Crystal structures of KpsC-N GT modules revealed a GT-B–like structure, where two simplified α/β Rossmann-like domains are reorganized and separated by additional inserted α-helices. Interestingly, the predominant structural differences between the KpsC-N and KpsC-C enzymes are found in the N-terminal α/β domains, which are implicated in acceptor binding in GT-B enzymes (15).\n\nBecause KpsC uses CMP-β-Kdo as its donor, and produces a β-Kdo–linked product, it is a retaining GT (5). Until recently, most mechanistically characterized retaining GTs were found to follow an S i (substitution nucleophilic internal return) mechanism. An alternative double-displacement mechanism, analogous to the well-established mechanism of retaining glycoside hydrolases (reviewed in (17)), has been proposed for one GT6-family enzyme (18), but experimental support for broader involvement of this mechanism in retaining GTs was limited. We recently provided experimental evidence that another β-Kdo GT (WbbB, a GT99 prototype from lipopolysaccharide O-antigen biosynthesis in Raoultella and Klebsiella) uses a double-displacement mechanism (19). KpsC is a distant homolog of WbbB and conserves three critical catalytic residues found in WbbB; an aspartate that serves as the nucleophile and forms an Asp–Kdo adduct, a histidine that protonates the CMP phosphate leaving group, and a glutamate that acts as a base to activate the incoming acceptor. Earlier studies showed that KpsC variants were catalytically inactive when either of the acidic residues were changed to alanine, while variants with the histidine mutated are severely catalytically compromised (7, 11). This pointed to a mechanism similar to WbbB, but definitive evidence was lacking. The primary objective of this work was therefore to investigate the potential use of a double-displacement mechanism by KpsC. To add further insight into the structure and function of KpsC, we also examined the structural basis for acceptor binding and its role in linkage specificity in the β-(2→4) Kdo transferase module. Finally, KpsC enzymes possess a C-terminal membrane-anchoring region and we assessed how this region affects the activities of KpsC.\n\nBacterial cell surface glycostructures are important virulence determinants and their exposure on the cell surface has made them attractive as vaccine targets. However, vaccine development is challenging because of the enormous structural and antigenic diversity of these polysaccharides among different species or serotypes within a species, as well as examples of host mimicry. Small molecule inhibitors of capsule biosynthesis offer a valid alternative (13), but this approach depends on identifying targets spread across serotypes and (preferably) species. KpsC is a potential therapeutic target because it is an essential component for assembling capsular structures in a diverse range of bacteria and homologs are absent from eukaryotes. However, understanding the mode of action of possible KpsC inhibitors and pursuing rational design of inhibitors are advanced by detailed understanding of the enzyme’s mechanism and biochemical characteristics. In this study, we present evidence that in KpsC (specifically KpsC-N), the donor Kdo is transferred from CMP-β-Kdo to Asp160, forming an Asp160-α-Kdo adduct, prior to transfer to the poly-Kdo acceptor. Therefore, like the distantly related β-Kdo transferase WbbB (19), KpsC operates via a double-displacement mechanism, rather than the S i mechanism otherwise generally observed in retaining GTs. The evolutionary origin of these enzymes is unclear. As a group, β-Kdo GTs represent a radical departure from typical GT-B enzymes, so a search of the PDB with DALI returns no additional proteins with global resemblance. They share an HP motif with some CMP-sialic acid–dependent inverting GTs, but we have not been able to identify any other potentially conserved motifs shared with other GT-B enzymes. Known retaining β-Kdo GTs show high sequence divergence resulting in a phylogenetic tree with long terminal branches, precluding deeper phylogenetic insight (5, 27). Indeed, prior to their initial biochemical characterization (7, 9), they were not annotated as GTs based on sequence alone. To summarize the proposed mechanism for KpsC-N, the reaction is initiated by Asp160 performing a nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of the Kdo group of CMP-β-Kdo, with His94 acting as a general acid to protonate the phosphate of the CMP leaving group (Fig. 10A). The resulting Asp160-β-Kdo adduct then repositions itself in the active site (Fig. 10B), occupying a second site with the anomeric carbon rotated 5.4 Å away from the CMP phosphate. This state is then preorganized for binding of the disaccharide Kdo acceptor, with the acceptor interacting primarily with the N-terminal α/β domain. The O4 group of the nonreducing terminal Kdo of the acceptor hydrogen bonds with Glu66, which acts as a general base (Fig. 10C). O4 then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the Asp160-β-Kdo group, resulting in the addition of a new β-(2→4)-linked Kdo group to the acceptor (Fig. 10D). The KpsC reactive site is therefore proposed to be composed of two distinct half sites, each with its own catalytic machinery for carrying out the two distinct half reactions. Of note, this mechanism opens up new potential strategies for targeting KpsC. In particular, the presence of a strong nucleophile in the enzyme, and the use of a covalent intermediate, suggest it may be susceptible to inhibition by electrophilic substrate mimics to form dead-end covalent adducts. Because the human genome encodes no apparent mechanistically similar enzymes, it may be possible to develop inhibitors with very narrow substrate specificity. Proposed mechanism of KpsC-N. A, the anomeric carbon of the donor Kdo is attacked by Asp160; His94 acts as a general acid, promoting departure of the phosphate group. B, the immediate product of the reaction is an unstably bound adduct. C, the adduct rearranges into a more stable configuration. After binding the acceptor, O4 of Kdo-A1 is activated by Glu66 and attacks the anomeric carbon of the Kdo adduct. D, the resulting product can then be released, allowing binding of the next CMP-Kdo donor. While most of the data presented here concern the KpsC-N GT module, the key residues that surround the CMP-β-Kdo–binding site catalyze the first half reaction and coordinate the α-Kdo intermediate in KpsC-N and are essentially identical in the KpsC-C GT module. This includes the HP and QXXXD motifs and Tyr97, Lys137, and Tyr138 in the helical subdomain (the equivalents of Tyr93, Lys133, and Tyr134 in KpsC-N , respectively). This, along with the demonstration that KpsC-C can form a C165-Kdo adduct, supports a model where KpsC-C also utilizes a similar double-displacement mechanism, with the structural states leading up to acceptor binding closely resembling those formed by the KpsC-N module. The data presented here leads to the conclusion that the N-terminal domain of each GT module alone controls acceptor binding and linkage specificity. This is consistent with the near absolute conservation of key motifs in the donor-binding C-terminal α/β domain, as well as the observation that the acceptor in the KpsC-N module interacts almost exclusively with the much more strongly divergent N-terminal domain. However, the most compelling evidence for this conclusion is provided by the presented biochemical experiments showing that the linkage specificities (β-(2→4)-Kdo and β-(2→7)-Kdo) in chimeric enzymes are dictated solely by the source of the N-terminal domain. This concept has been exploited previously in the creation of chimeric enzymes with new specificities using GT-B fold GTs from glycopeptide biosynthesis (23). Our data supports the validity of the chimera approach in engineering enzymes with new activities to synthesize defined glycostructures for fundamental and applied research. The precise acceptor recognition mode of KpsC-C has not been resolved. The need for the acceptor to both be activated as a nucleophile by Glu70 and to position its O7 hydroxyl group adjacent to the Kdo adduct anomeric carbon constrains possible acceptor models. However, it is not clear how the next acceptor Kdo residue would be recognized or why (2→4) linked substrates might be excluded. Unfortunately, while we were able to grow crystals of the KpsC-C D165C variant with a covalent Kdo-adduct in the presence of a β-Kdo-(2→4)-β-Kdo-(2→7)-β-Kdo trisaccharide acceptor, these crystals did not yield usable diffraction data. Removal of the C-terminal amphipathic helix from KpsC results in an enzyme that is soluble and more amenable for applications screening and inhibitor development. This change also alters the product profile. The AlphaFold model suggests that the changes in product length distribution are unlikely to be due to perturbation of the active site by the C-terminal amphipathic helix, and the changes may simply reflect altered interactions between enzyme and the nascent chains. The natural acceptor is a membrane-embedded glycolipid, rather than a soluble synthetic conjugate, and the activity of KpsC is also constrained by the intervention of enzymes that add the serotype-specific glycan. As a result, while the effect of the helix deletion is interesting, it is not possible to directly translate the in vitro product profile to the mechanism by which product length is regulated within the cell. Nevertheless, understanding the baseline product profile is important in developing and evaluating small-molecule inhibitors. Collectively, the data reported here offer substantial new insight into the mechanism of action and determination of specificity of β-Kdo GTs and identify concepts that may be relevant for other GTs. These studies provide an essential foundation for the exploitation of KpsC as a therapeutic target.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, bacteria were grown at 37 °C in LB medium (Invitrogen) containing (where appropriate) one or more of the following supplements: kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and IPTG (0.3 mM). E. coli DH5α (φ80d deoR lacZΔM15 endA1 recA1 hsdR17 (r − m +) supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169 F−) (Invitrogen) was used as a host for cloning. Protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) (F − ompT gal dcm hsdS (r − m −) λ(DE3)) (Novagen). The plasmids used in this study are described in Table S2. They were maintained in E. coli DH5α, grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. KOD or Phusion DNA polymerase was used to PCR amplify DNA fragments for cloning and site-directed mutagenesis. For cloning, oligonucleotide primers (Table S3) incorporated restriction sites and sequences encoding epitope tags. GeneJET PCR Purification (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kits were used to purify PCR fragments, and GeneJET Plasmid Purification (Thermo Fisher) kits were used to purify plasmids. Restriction endonucleases (Invitrogen and New England Biolabs) were used as recommended by the manufacturers. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Quik-change site-directed mutagenesis strategy (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The Actinobacillus pleuropnumoniae kpsC gene was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli and synthesized by GeneArt Gene Synthesis service based on the sequence in Accession number ABN74779. The E. coli KpsC sequence was taken from Accession Number KIE82100. Recombinant plasmids containing genes encoding chimeric KpsC proteins were constructed by cloning PCR fragments into pET28a(+) via Gibson Assembly, according to manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences of all plasmid constructs were verified at the Genomics Facility in the University of Guelph Advanced Analysis Centre. Overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 (DE3) transformants containing the appropriate plasmids (Table S2) were used to inoculate 0.25 to 1 L of LB medium, supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin, at a 1:100 dilution. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A of ∼0.6 was achieved. Expression of the recombinant gene was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.3 mM, and the cells were left to grow for 2.5 to 3 h at 37 °C. In all cases, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g for 10 min and stored at −80 °C until needed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris–HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 8.0) supplemented with Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by ultrasonication for a total of 3.5 min with 30% amplitude in pulses (10 s on/15 s off). The suspension was cleared via successive centrifugation steps at 4000g for 10 min, 12,000g for 20 min, and 100,000g for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were purified directly from the residual supernatant from the final centrifugation step using 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin columns (Qiagen). The column was conditioned initially with 10 column volumes of buffer A before sample was applied. The column was then washed with 10 column volumes each of buffer B (buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole), before elution with 10 column volumes of buffer C (buffer A containing 500 mM imidazole); eluent was collected in 1-ml fractions. Protein purity was assessed using SDS-PAGE with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Life Technologies). Protein was buffer exchanged using a PD-10 desalting column and concentrated using a Vivaspin centrifugal concentrator. Proteins used for in vitro biochemical experiments were buffer exchanged into buffer A, whereas proteins used in x-ray crystallography experiments were buffer exchanged as described below. Protein concentrations were estimated from A values using theoretical extinction coefficients predicted by the ExPASy ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). For long-term storage, proteins were placed in buffer A and stored at −80 °C. KpsC proteins and their variants were analyzed using LC-MS on an Agilent 1260 HPLC Liquid Chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent UHD 6530 Q-Tof Mass Spectrometer at the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the Advanced Analysis Centre, University of Guelph. A Zorbax 300SB-C18 column (1 × 50 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent) was used for separation of protein from detergents with the following solvents: water with 0.1% formic acid for A and acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid for B. The mobile phase gradient was as follows: initial conditions, 10% B for 5 min, increasing to 85% B in 7 min and then to 95% B in 0.10 min followed by column wash at 95% B and 5 min re-equilibration. The first 2 min and last 5 min of gradient were sent to waste. The flow rate was maintained at 0.3 ml/min. The mass spectrometer electrospray capillary voltage was maintained at 5.0 kV and the drying gas temperature at 350° C with a flow rate of 13 l/min. Nebulizer pressure was 40 p.s.i., and the fragmentor was set to 300 V. Nitrogen (purity > 98%) was used as nebulizing, drying, and collision gas. The mass-to-charge ratio was scanned across the m/z range of 300 to 3200 m/z in 4 GHz (extended dynamic range) positive-ion mode. The instrument was externally calibrated with the ESI TuneMix (Agilent). The sample injection volume was 2 μl. Data analysis was performed using the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Version B.06.00 (Agilent; https://www.agilent.com/Library/usermanuals/Public/G3336-90024_Qual_Familiarization_GCMS.pdf) software. Deconvolution of the m/z spectrum was achieved using the pMod algorithm within the BioConfirm software (Agilent; https://www.agilent.com/en/product/software-informatics/mass-spectrometry-software/data-analysis/bioconfirm-software). For tryptic digestion of KpsC-N enzymes, modified trypsin was used where autolysis has been blocked and chymotryptic activity inhibited (Fisher Sequencing Grade Modified trypsin V5111). Twenty micrograms of trypsin were dissolved in 20 mM acetic acid to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/μl. When ready for digestion, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate was added such that the enzyme working solution was 0.01 μg of enzyme. Trypsin was added in a 1:10 ratio of protease to protein and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Mass spectrometry was as above, except that a C18 column (Agilent 32 AdvanceBio Peptide Map, 100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) was used for chromatographic separation (at 0.2 ml/min), and the mobile phase gradient was as follows: initial conditions, 2% B, increasing to 45% B in 40 min and then to 55% B in 10 more minutes followed by column wash at 95% B and 10 min re-equilibration. Three precursor ions per cycle were selected for fragmentation. Raw data files were loaded directly into PEAKS 8.5 software (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc; https://www.bioinfor.com/peaks-85-release/), where the data was refined and subjected to de novo sequencing and database searching. The following modifications were considered within the search parameters: deamidation of asparagine and glutamine (+0.98 Da), oxidation of methionine (+15.99 Da), and Kdo glycosylation (+220.06 Da). The tolerance values used were 15 ppm for parent ions and 0.05 Da for fragment ions. Data was searched against the WT KpsC-N and variant sequences. Acceptor 1 was prepared as previously described (14). The chemical synthesis of 2 and enzymatic synthesis of 3 are described in the Supporting Information text and Fig. S5. In vitro reactions were performed in 40 μl volumes and contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM Kdo, 1.25 mM CTP, 5 μM acceptor 1, 4 μg of KdsB, and 4 μg of KpsC-N or its variants (D160N, D160C, or D160A). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Ten microliters of aliquots were removed and stopped by adding equal amounts of cold acetonitrile, followed by removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation at 13,000g for 5 min. HPLC analysis was performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with a 1260 Infinity II Variable Wavelength Detector. A DNAPac PA-100 column (4 × 50 mm) was used for chromatographic separation with the following solvents: water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 2 M ammonium acetate (C). The mobile phase gradient was as follows: 20% B was kept constant throughout the run; initial conditions were 0% C; increasing to 50% C in 15 min; hold 50% C for 5 min; decreasing to 0% C in 5 min; 15 min of re-equilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min, and the column temperature was set to 40 °C. The elution profile was monitored by UV detection at 503 nm and the injection volume was 8 μl. These analyses were performed in triplicate. Determination of the structure of E. coli KpsC2-323 D160N and D160C by x-ray crystallography All crystallization experiments were performed using a sitting-drop configuration at room temperature. Protein was buffer exchanged into a 20 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CMP, pH 7.5 solution and concentrated. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160N was mixed in a 1:1 ratio (2 μl drop volume) with the well solution and equilibrated against ∼100 μl of the same well solution. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160N (at 15 mg/ml) was crystallized using a well solution containing 0.2 M lithium sulfate, 29 % (v/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, and 2 mM strontium acetate. To generate CMP-Kdo, a reaction containing 50 mM Hepes, 5 mM MgCl , 4 mM Kdo, 10 mM CTP, and 4.5 μg of KdsB from E. coli was incubated for 2.5 min before soaking crystals with the reaction mixture for 8 min at room temperature in a well, where the PEG 3350 concentration had been increased to 33 %, prior to cryoprotection. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160C was mixed with 5 mM acceptor 2 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to crystallization. E. coli KpsC2-323 D160C (at 10 mg/ml) was crystallized using a well solution containing 25 % (v/v) PEG 3350 and 0.1 M Bis-Tris, pH 5.5; protein was mixed in a 1:1 ratio (0.3 μl drop volume) with the well solution and equilibrated against ∼40 μl of the same solution. All crystals were immersed in paratone N oil for cryoprotection prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Datasets were collected at the Canadian Light Source beam-line 08ID at 100 K and were processed using XDS and scaled using XSCALE (36). Using 6MGC as a search model in Phenix Phaser (28), the E. coli KpsC-N2-323 D160N structure was determined in P3 21 at 1.90 Å. After refinement, this structure (KpsC-N D160N, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit) was substantially complete; residues 1–320 were traced, and a short, disordered region was evident encompassing 143–146. Again, using 6MGC as a search model in Phenix Phaser (28), the E. coli KpsC-N2-323 D160C structure was determined in P2 at 1.20 Å resolution. This structure (KpsC-N D160C) has two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Chain A has residues 1–323 (plus one residue of the His -tag) traced, with a short, disordered region encompassing 146–147. Chain B has residues 1–323 (plus two residues of the His -tag) traced, with a short, disordered region encompassing 195–201. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are shown for both structures in Table 1. Structure figures were prepared in PyMol v.2.3.4. Investigation of the activities of chimeric enzymes from E. coli and T. dismutans KpsC modules Reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM Kdo, 1.25 mM CTP, 2 μg E coli KdsB, 12 μM acceptors 1 or 3, and 4 μg of purified Chimera or Chimera , in a 20 μl final volume. The concentrations of acceptors 1 and 3 were estimated by measuring the absorbance at 505 nm using an extinction coefficient of 80,000 M−1 cm−1 (Invitrogen). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To generate products for subsequent enzyme modification reactions, the reaction volume was doubled, and the mixture was then filtered through Microcon-10 kDa centrifugal filters to remove protein. Ten microliters of the protein-free reaction mixture were then used in 20 μl reactions consisting of 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 0.5 mM Kdo, 1.25 mM CTP, 2 μg KdsB, and 4 μg of the purified E. coli KpsC2-352 or KpsC2-675 D160A proteins. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. One microliter of the aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by TLC. The TLC plate was developed in freshly prepared ethyl acetate:1-butanol:water:acetic acid mixture (10:8:8:5, v/v), and the products were visualized using a hand-held UV lamp. Reactions were performed in 20 μl volumes to optimize enzyme:acceptor ratios. Reactions contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 1 mM Kdo, 2.5 mM CTP, 1 μg E coli KdsB, 0.1 to 1 mM acceptor 1, and varying quantities of the purified Chimera protein. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 1 μl aliquots of each reaction were analyzed by TLC as described above. Conversion of acceptor 1 to product 4 was achieved using 0.35 mM acceptor 1, along with 250 μg Chimera . Once conditions were optimized, the reaction was scaled up to a 500 μl volume incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, with reaction progress being assessed via TLC. Reaction mixture was diluted to 5 ml in water and loaded onto a Sep-Pak Plus C cartridge previously equilibrated with 10 ml of acetonitrile and 20 ml of water. The column was washed with 20 ml of water and product(s) were eluted in 5 ml of 50% (v/v) acetonitrile/water before pooling the eluent. The eluent was concentrated to 250 μl for further purification via size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 Gl column (30 × 1 cm), eluted in 100 mM sodium acetate (at 0.8 ml/min), and monitored using A and TLC. Elution fractions containing product 4 were combined, desalted using Sep-Pak Plus C cartridge, and dried using a SpeedVac or lyophilization. NMR studies were performed at the NMR Centre of the Advanced Analysis Centre at the University of Guelph. The purified reaction product was deuterium-exchanged by freeze-drying twice from 99.9% D O. The sample was suspended in 250 μl of 99.99% D O and placed in a 5 mm Shigemi NMR microtube. 1H NMR, and 2D 1H-13C HSQC spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe. Sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropanoate-2,2,3,3-d was added to the sample as a chemical shift reference in the 1H and 13C dimensions (δ = 0 ppm, δ =−1.6 ppm). The two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC experiment was collected using standard pulse sequences and parameters. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro products from KpsC reactions ESI MS analyses were performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC liquid chromatograph interfaced with an Agilent UHD 6530 Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Advanced Analysis Centre, University of Guelph). The mass spectrometer electrospray capillary voltage was maintained at 4.0 kV and the drying gas temperature at 250 °C with a flow rate of 8 L min−1. Nebulizer pressure was 30 p.s.i., and the fragmentor was set to 160. Nozzle, skimmer, and octopole RF voltages were set at 1000 V, 65 V and 750 V, respectively. Nitrogen (purity > 98%) was used as nebulizing, drying, and collision gas. The mass-to-charge ratio was scanned across the m/z range of 50 to 2000 m/z in 4 GHz (extended dynamic range) negative-ion modes. Data were collected by target- or data-independent MS/MS acquisition with an MS and MS/MS scan rate of 1.41 spectra s−1. The acquisition rate was set at 2 spectra s−1. The mass axis was calibrated using the Agilent tuning mix HP0321 (Agilent Technologies) prepared in acetonitrile. Mass spectrometer control, data acquisition, and data analysis were performed with MassHunter Workstation software (https://www.agilent.com/en/product/software-informatics/mass-spectrometry-software). Purified reaction products and in vitro E. coli KpsC reaction products with acceptor 1 were separated on a C18 column (Agilent Poroshell 120, EC-C18 50 mm × 3.0 mm, 2.7 μm) with the following solvents: water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). The mobile phase gradient was as follows: initial conditions were 10% B hold for 1 min; increasing to 100% B in 29 min; column wash at 100% B for 5 min; 20 min re-equilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 0.4 ml min−1. In vitro reactions were performed in 60 μl volumes and contained 50 mM Hepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl , 3 mM Kdo, 5 mM CTP, 40 μM acceptor 1, 2.9 μM E. coli KdsB, and 6.3 μM of KpsC protein (E. coli KpsC2-675, E. coli KpsC2-650, A. pleuropneumoniae KpsC2-689, and A. pleuropneumoniae KpsC2-670). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C. In a time-course experiment, 10 μl aliquots were removed after 1, 10, 30, 60 min, and 21 h and quenched by mixing with 10 μl cold acetonitrile. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min, and supernatant was collected in an HPLC vial. Reaction pellet was then resuspended in 10 μl water before centrifugation at 12,000g for 5 min. Supernatant was removed and combined with the supernatant in the HPLC vial for a final volume of 30 μl. HPLC analysis was performed on Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC system equipped with 1260 Infinity II Variable Wavelength Detector. A DNAPac PA-100 column (4 × 50 mm) was used for chromatographic separation with the following solvents: water (A), acetonitrile (B), and 2 M ammonium acetate (C). The mobile phase gradient was as follows: 15 % B was kept constant throughout the run; initial conditions were 0% C; increasing to 75% C in 30 min; hold 75% C for 5 min; decreasing to 0% C in 5 min; 15 min re-equilibration. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml min−1, and the column temperature was set to 40 °C. The elution profile was monitored by UV detection at 503 nm and the injection volume was 15 μl. Experiments were repeated three times."}

Wikipedia: Pernštejn Castle (Czech: hrad Pernštejn, from German: Bernstein, originally from Bärenstein) is a castle in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It lies on a rock above the village of Nedvědice and the rivers Svratka and Nedvědička, about 40 kilometres (25 mi) northwest of Brno. Pernštejn came to be known as the marble castle because of the marble-like stone used to frame the doors and windows.\n\nIt was founded by the Lords of Medlov probably between 1270 and 1285. The family branch seated at the castle and adopted the then fashionable name Pernštejn (written also Pernstein), which is the Czech version probably derived of the German name, Bärenstein – the \"Bear Rock\". Its history is closely connected to the Pernštejn family and their descendants. It has kept its intact appearance in the Gothic and Renaissance form as it was finished in the first half of the 16th century by the Pernštejns, then the richest and most powerful lordly family of the Bohemian kingdom. Pernštejn is one of the best preserved castles in Czech Republic.\n\nThe castle was built as a typical nazal[check spelling] castle in a place which suited perfectly to its purpose: from three sides it was protected by a steep rock slope (the rock penetrates the building up to the second floor), accessible only from the north across a ridge that rises towards the castle and could be easily diked and protected by a system of bails. A prostrate, protruding settlement around the castle is formed by five yards, demarcated by outbuildings, ramparts, gates and a bastion in the north and barbican in the centre. In the most convenient place there is a lake in the rock with an unfailing spring, today covered with castle buildings, accessible from the inner castle courtyard. The core of the castle was built here: the Barborka Tower (a round five-storied tower with an edge turned toward the driveway), the castle palace and the courtyard protected by the rampart. These parts were completely covered by later extensions, only the high tower Barborka still projects over the complex of castle buildings. The builder of the castle is unknown. The first historically recorded ancestor of the Pernštejn family can be considered Stephen of Medlov, a significant Moravian personality from the beginning of the 13th century. It as probably he who transferred the family property from the southern Moravia to the Uplands. It was in the 13th century that the foundations of the new manorial power: a large property of land independent on the service to the sovereign on his favour, with servile villages and strong castles. Several significant Moravian noble families built their dominions exactly in the southeastern area of the Uplands. The sovereign's control did not reach this far, there was enough land for colonisation, forests for hunting, places for building castles and private law ruled there.\n\nDuring the wild years after the extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty (1306) and during the rule of John of Bohemia (1310–1346) there are not many notes of the Pernštejn Castle and of its masters. Though, it can be supposed that they belonged to those of whom the King Charles IV wrote that \"they mostly became tyrants and did not fear the king, as it beseemed, because they had divided the kingdom among themselves\". Not even the quieter years during the rule of Charles IV and his brother margrave John Henry could not stop the rise of the manorial power. We only know the names of the Pernštejn lords from the first two-thirds of the 14th century. They took part in the public life in assemblies and authorities, further expanding their property. The castle probably did not change too much in those days; its prime was to come during the last quarter of the 14th century and during the 15th century.\n\nAfter the death of the margrave John Henry (1375), Moravia was split into several adverse, mutually harrying parties, and the castles became bases of political parties and nests of robber barons. At that time of William I was the head of the Pernštejn family and lord of the castle (he appears in documents from 1378 to 1422). The Pernštejn garrison fought not only for their political interests of its masters, but also forayed on almost all high roads of Moravia. An indispensable amount from such incomes went to William's treasury. But William kept on taking part in parliament and the High Court of Justice and executed the duties of prominent offices in the land. He started the rise of the house to the highest social and political goals.\n\nIn the 15th to 17th centuries the military and political significance of the castle grew to its peak. At that time Pernštejn was not only a centre of a large barony, but also a fortress, which played an important role in the struggle for Moravia and the city of Brno. This role of the castle responds for the first leg of its construction – John I carried out the largest reconstruction of the castle, which was also supposed to repair the damage after a big fire from the time before 1460. To the original heart of the castle was then complemented mainly by an ingenious fortification system that protected the whole naze. Ditches were dug around the castle and walls with new towers were built in the angles of the ramparts and inside the castle complex. The typical Pernštejn square tower grew outside the castle premises and was connected with them by means of two wooden bridges, which was to allow the last resort for defence and withdrawal in the case of seizure of the castle's core.\n\nThe castle premises spread by new buildings to the prejudice of the inner yard, and the castle that lacked room began to grow upward. The main fortification system grew toward the north, the only possible direction where an attack could come from. The whole naze was built in this direction as a part of the fortress; it was surrounded by walls and diked by several moats with drawbridges. On the northern end there stood a tall semicircle renaissance bastion protecting the entrance to the spacious settlement around the castle with outbuildings. Another barrier on the way toward the castle was a mighty barbican whose 3 m thick walls with crenels for light firearms and a machicolation protected a narrow way to the entrance surrounded by ramparts. Even if the enemy got across another moat in the very area of the castle, they even would have to face the problem of conquering the only narrow entrance high above the ground to which a wooden ramp terminated by a drawbridge originally led. And then they would have to enter the rooms of the castle through a labyrinth of narrow passages and stairways where two men-at-arms could not pass side by side. The barbican belongs to the best-preserved examples of the late Gothic fortification element in the Czech lands.\n\nThe appearance of the castle changed once more – at the end of the 15th and during the first half of the 16th century. The reconstruction was started by William II of Pernštejn (1435–1521). He lived in the area of transition of the Czech lands from Middle Ages to Renaissance and managed to use the relative peace with his \"economic\" sense to a fantastic rise of the family fortune. At the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century William II is an almost more important personality of interior politics than the Jagello kings. He strove for the unity of the Czech kingdom against the separatist tendencies of the Moravians, forewarned to encroachment of foreigners and of decline of manners. William II of Pernštejn is considered one of the most significant personalities of the Czech history and his political activity is often compared to that of emperor Charles IV.\n\nAt that time the castle grew by new halls: where it was impossible to move the walls further out cantilevers were inserted and jetties were made on them, therefore the upper floors of the castle have a bigger area than the ground floor. The entrance space was coved with diamond vault and the former tower cells were turned into dwelling rooms. The Renaissance style, which was brought to Pernštejn probably by the Italians,[1] was promoted in the spatial concept of the new halls, and in the stonework on the reveals of windows and portals.\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century came the agony of the house of the Pernštejn. In 1596 they had to sell the castle. Much of the family's wealth and property passed to the Lobkowicz family, through Polyxena Pernštejn's marriage to Zdeněk Vojtěch Popel of Lobkowicz, Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom. At the end of the 16th century and beginning of the 17th century Pernštejn Castle changed several owners. Its impregnability served well during the Thirty Years' War, specially at times of the siege of the city of Brno by the Swedish army in 1645. They besieged the castle in vain and their cannonade damaged only part of the top floor. In wars Pernštejn was a safe refuge for the neighbouring population and their property, and between the mid-17th and mid-18th centuries it was acclaimed a municipal fortress. In 1710 the Pernštejn estate was bought by Francis of Stockhammer, and the castle remained in the property of that family until 1793.\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries the appearance of the castle did not change much. Only some interior changes were preserved, and the stuccowork of the Knights' hall from the years around 1700 or Rococo paintings in the bedroom and in the Chinese parlour from the 1760s. Outbuildings were erected around the castle; a new Baroque chapel with fresco paintings by Francis Gregor Ignacus Eckstein from 1716 replaced the older castle chapel. The new owners had their coat-of-arms sculpted in the rock, and kept on spreading the original park. East of the barbican there is an old yew-tree connected with the tales of the foundation of the castle. Its circuit is 4.5 metres (15 ft) and it is the oldest and biggest yew in the southern Moravian region.\n\nIn 1818 the castle came to the hands of the Mitrovský family. The castle obtained its actual appearance partly down to the Mitrovský family who refused to succumb to the Romantic styles of the 19th century and partly due to the fact that the castle has never suffered at the hands of their enemies.[2] The gate of the first settlement is protected by the older forward fortifications from the beginning of the 16th century. In the prolate settlement there are several outbuilding and a renaissance bastion with a gate, into which the original driveway issues. The road to the castle surmounts the moat and barbican across a baroque bridge. The corridor between the two ramparts, characteristic of the Pernštejn fortifications, lead to the gate of the second settlement (from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries) with Gothic-Renaissance marble portal. The barbican complex and the second settlement are surrounded by a revetted moat, across which a stairway in the south leads to terrace garden. Gothic bridges issues to the protruding tower of the third gate, through the marble portal of which we can enter the settlement around the inner castle. On the right, there is a unified Gothic building, which was formed by joining of the gradually accumulated building at the end of the 15th century. In the southern part built in the mid-15th century there is a large round tower. Toward the north there spreads a line of Renaissance and older administrative building. After passing through the Black Gate the way leads across another Gothic bridge to eastern parts of the settlement. In the east this part ends by a round Clock tower. In the west a Renaissance chapel adheres to this tower. The Tower of Four Seasons called by the colourful glass in the windows was originally smaller and was incorporated in the rampart during the reign of William I. The access to the bridge into the core of the castle is made on a covered staircase ramp, and the palace core is entered via the late-Gothic portal. The passage leads directly to the main communication space of the castle, the passage to the right leads to the small Tyrolian Yard. In the northwestern corner of the castle core there stands five-storey Barborka tower with an edge turned toward the driveway. A two-tract palace stood in the south, with its cellars partly dug in the rock. The large Knights' hall on the first floor was completely rebuilt and its Renaissance vault was decorated with stuccowork and fresco paintings.\n\nDuring the rule of John I the last medieval expansion of residential and representative rooms was achieved: the new renaissance palace was attached to the core and the residential tower in the southeast. On the ground floor there is a vaulted passage of the Black Gate, on the first floor there is a big hall with three fields of Renaissance cross vault used as a library since the 19th century. The first floor contains five representative chambers, the largest of which is the picture gallery. With the exception of Baroque ceilings and Rococo decoration they are preserved in the original Renaissance form.\n\nDuring the reconstruction works on Pernštejn dozens of inscriptions (in Czech, German and Latin) and paintings dating back mostly to the mid-16th century were discovered under the passage plastering. They are an interesting proof of the life in the castle and of the cultural profile of the time. Today the castle is a property of the state. This unique architectural heritage has been lately conserved and made accessible to serve as a document of what the seat of prominent lords of the country looked like.\n• List of castles in the Moravian-Silesian Region\n• List of castles in the South Moravian Region"}
