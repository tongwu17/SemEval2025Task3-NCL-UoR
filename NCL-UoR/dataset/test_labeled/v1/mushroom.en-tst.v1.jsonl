Before World War II, Jews made up a large percentage of the population in O\u017car\u00f3w. According to historical records, in 1931, out of a total population of approximately 4,500 people, around 2,800 were Jewish.\n\nThe Jewish community in O\u017car\u00f3w had a rich cultural and religious life. They had their own synagogue, schools, and various organizations. The town also had a large market where Jews sold textiles, leather goods, and other merchandise.\n\nHowever, during the Holocaust, most of the Jewish population was killed or forced to flee. In 1942, the Nazis established a labor camp in O\u017car\u00f3w, which was later transformed into a concentration camp. Thousands of Jews from various parts of Poland were brought there and subjected to forced labor, starvation, and brutal treatment. Many died from disease or were killed during mass shootings. By the end of the war, only a few hundred Jews survived out of the pre-war population of around 2,800.\n\nToday, there are several sites in O\u017car\u00f3w that commemorate its Jewish history. These include the ruins of the synagogue, which have been turned into a memorial site, and the Jewish cemetery, which has been restored and is now a protected monument. There is also a museum in the town dedicated to the history of the Jewish community in O\u017car\u00f3w.","model_id":"TheBloke\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF","soft_labels":[{"start":1,"prob":0.1,"end":4},{"start":6,"prob":0.1,"end":12},{"start":41,"prob":0.5,"end":48},{"start":48,"prob":0.2,"end":57},{"start":71,"prob":0.1,"end":97},{"start":106,"prob":0.1,"end":120},{"start":120,"prob":0.3,"end":124},{"start":124,"prob":0.2,"end":135},{"start":135,"prob":0.5,"end":151},{"start":151,"prob":0.3,"end":169},{"start":169,"prob":0.2,"end":179},{"start":179,"prob":0.1,"end":181},{"start":181,"prob":0.3,"end":217},{"start":217,"prob":0.6,"end":221},{"start":221,"prob":0.5,"end":252},{"start":252,"prob":0.6,"end":304},{"start":304,"prob":0.1,"end":338},{"start":338,"prob":0.2,"end":342},{"start":342,"prob":0.3,"end":360},{"start":360,"prob":0.2,"end":376},{"start":378,"prob":0.2,"end":383},{"start":383,"prob":0.3,"end":408},{"start":408,"prob":0.4,"end":441},{"start":441,"prob":0.3,"end":464},{"start":464,"prob":0.4,"end":469},{"start":469,"prob":0.3,"end":475},{"start":475,"prob":0.4,"end":477},{"start":477,"prob":0.6,"end":538},{"start":538,"prob":0.5,"end":539},{"start":539,"prob":0.1,"end":633},{"start":633,"prob":0.2,"end":640},{"start":640,"prob":0.1,"end":642},{"start":642,"prob":0.2,"end":664},{"start":664,"prob":0.3,"end":666},{"start":666,"prob":0.4,"end":675},{"start":675,"prob":0.3,"end":676},{"start":676,"prob":0.2,"end":685},{"start":685,"prob":0.3,"end":698},{"start":698,"prob":0.4,"end":704},{"start":704,"prob":0.5,"end":723},{"start":723,"prob":0.6,"end":740},{"start":740,"prob":0.5,"end":741},{"start":741,"prob":0.1,"end":743},{"start":743,"prob":0.2,"end":813},{"start":813,"prob":0.4,"end":826},{"start":826,"prob":0.5,"end":850},{"start":850,"prob":0.4,"end":855},{"start":855,"prob":0.3,"end":871},{"start":871,"prob":0.2,"end":874},{"start":874,"prob":0.3,"end":879},{"start":879,"prob":0.4,"end":889},{"start":889,"prob":0.5,"end":933},{"start":933,"prob":0.3,"end":935},{"start":935,"prob":0.4,"end":965},{"start":965,"prob":0.5,"end":990},{"start":990,"prob":0.4,"end":1031},{"start":1031,"prob":0.5,"end":1035},{"start":1035,"prob":0.4,"end":1036},{"start":1036,"prob":0.1,"end":1039},{"start":1039,"prob":0.2,"end":1073},{"start":1073,"prob":0.3,"end":1115},{"start":1115,"prob":0.2,"end":1131},{"start":1131,"prob":0.3,"end":1133},{"start":1133,"prob":0.4,"end":1135},{"start":1135,"prob":0.7,"end":1157},{"start":1157,"prob":0.5,"end":1160},{"start":1160,"prob":0.6,"end":1202},{"start":1202,"prob":0.4,"end":1210},{"start":1210,"prob":0.3,"end":1257},{"start":1257,"prob":0.4,"end":1286},{"start":1286,"prob":0.7,"end":1377},{"start":1377,"prob":0.6,"end":1379}],"hard_labels":[[217,221],[252,304],[477,538],[723,740],[1135,1157],[1160,1202],[1286,1379]],"model_output_tokens":["

{"id":"tst-en-75","lang":"EN","model_input":"Who were the first settlers of Steelville, Missouri?","model_output_text":" The exact identities of the very first settlers in Steelville, Missouri, are not definitively known. However, we do have some information about early settlers and pioneers who played significant roles in the development of the community.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded settlers was John H. McMurtry, who arrived in 1835. He is believed to have built a log cabin near the present-day site of Steelville. McMurtry served as the first postmaster when the town's post office was established in 1840.\n\nAnother early settler was John H. Dillon, who came to the area around 1836. He is credited with helping to establish the town of Steelville and served as its first sheriff.\n\nOther early settlers included the families of James W. McClure, William H. McClure, and John M. McClure, who arrived in the late 1830s or early 1840s. These families were among the founders of the First Presbyterian Church in Steelville, which was organized in 1842.\n\nIt's important to note that these settlers likely arrived in small groups over an extended period of time, and there may have been other early settlers whose names are not recorded in history. Additionally, some sources suggest that there were Native American inhabitants in the area prior to European settlement, but this is not well-documented.","model_id":"TheBloke\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF","soft_labels":[{"start":1,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":5},{"start":5,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":33},{"start":33,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":74},{"start":74,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":78},{"start":78,"prob":0.6363636364,"end":94},{"start":94,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":100},{"start":164,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":172},{"start":240,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":282},{"start":282,"prob":0.9090909091,"end":298},{"start":298,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":304},{"start":304,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":311},{"start":311,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":313},{"start":313,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":315},{"start":315,"prob":0.6363636364,"end":319},{"start":319,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":321},{"start":321,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":352},{"start":352,"prob":0.7272727273,"end":361},{"start":361,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":387},{"start":387,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":401},{"start":401,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":403},{"start":403,"prob":0.7272727273,"end":411},{"start":411,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":426},{"start":426,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":432},{"start":432,"prob":0.6363636364,"end":442},{"start":442,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":459},{"start":459,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":470},{"start":470,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":475},{"start":475,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":490},{"start":490,"prob":0.8181818182,"end":494},{"start":494,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":497},{"start":497,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":521},{"start":521,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":523},{"start":523,"prob":0.9090909091,"end":535},{"start":535,"prob":0.8181818182,"end":537},{"start":537,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":567},{"start":567,"prob":0.8181818182,"end":571},{"start":571,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":573},{"start":573,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":655},{"start":655,"prob":0.6363636364,"end":660},{"start":660,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":661},{"start":661,"prob":0.6363636364,"end":667},{"start":667,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":668},{"start":668,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":671},{"start":671,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":714},{"start":714,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":715},{"start":715,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":717},{"start":717,"prob":0.9090909091,"end":733},{"start":733,"prob":0.8181818182,"end":735},{"start":735,"prob":0.9090909091,"end":753},{"start":753,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":759},{"start":759,"prob":0.9090909091,"end":772},{"start":772,"prob":0.8181818182,"end":774},{"start":774,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":795},{"start":795,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":800},{"start":800,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":805},{"start":805,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":815},{"start":815,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":820},{"start":820,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":822},{"start":822,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":852},{"start":852,"prob":0.5454545455,"end":860},{"start":860,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":868},{"start":868,"prob":0.8181818182,"end":893},{"start":893,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":907},{"start":907,"prob":0.3636363636,"end":919},{"start":919,"prob":0.4545454545,"end":932},{"start":932,"prob":0.7272727273,"end":936},{"start":936,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":1043},{"start":1043,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":1130},{"start":1130,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":1232},{"start":1232,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":1240},{"start":1240,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":1251},{"start":1251,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":1253},{"start":1253,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":1265},{"start":1265,"prob":0.2727272727,"end":1268},{"start":1268,"prob":0.1818181818,"end":1282},{"start":1282,"prob":0.0909090909,"end":1283}],"hard_labels":[[78,100],[282,298],[304,311],[315,319],[352,361],[403,411],[426,442],[490,494],[523,537],[567,571],[655,668],[717,774],[800,805],[815,820],[852,860],[868,893],[932,936]],"model_output_tokens":["

There, in 1975, his unit was involved in an incident in which a group of soldiers killed a South Korean civilian. This led to his demotion and transfer to a less prestigious unit. Following the assassination of Kim Jong-il in 2011, and the subsequent power struggle between his two sons, Kim Jung-un and Kim Young Un, it was widely speculated that Chohung would be appointed Prime minister. However, this did not happen and Chung Eui-Yong was instead chosen. It is not clear if Chon was ever considered for the position. Kim Chol-hwan was the last Prime Minster of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The current leader of DPRK is Kim Il-sung.
