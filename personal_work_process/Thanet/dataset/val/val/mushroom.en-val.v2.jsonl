Failure to hit all the targets within a certain time limit results in penalties, such as additional laps or extra time added to their race.","model_id":"TheBloke\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF","soft_labels":[{"start":52,"prob":1.0,"end":67},{"start":67,"prob":0.1,"end":90},{"start":90,"prob":0.2,"end":95},{"start":95,"prob":0.6,"end":104},{"start":104,"prob":0.9,"end":106},{"start":106,"prob":0.5,"end":110},{"start":110,"prob":0.9,"end":123},{"start":123,"prob":0.3,"end":125},{"start":125,"prob":0.4,"end":205},{"start":205,"prob":0.3,"end":207},{"start":207,"prob":0.4,"end":269},{"start":269,"prob":0.5,"end":297},{"start":297,"prob":0.4,"end":524}],"hard_labels":[[52,67],[95,106],[110,123]],"model_output_logits":[-2.3600585461,0.103356123,0.6726959944,9.1177215576,2.6622414589,1.6804867983,2.6047062874,3.7379643917,-0.1229089797,5.3446612358,-0.1929446459,4.2065162659,4.3122844696,5.2387485504,-2.3209753036,4.1673498154,-3.9102299213,4.2049150467,4.2326264381,-4.3279743195,-1.362152338,-0.2333314717,-0.8806750178,6.1592931747,2.5755705833,4.7990999222,4.1246118546,5.0588116646,25.9321022034,0.4649152756,2.024595499,4.3422660828,2.0544297695,0.3808968663,8.3695373535,5.6166057587,11.0985488892,14.1910915375,17.4510478973,2.8715047836,3.2486376762,2.2532367706,11.4523077011,-1.7132380009,5.2983880043,2.9713969231,7.0333008766,5.8152360916,6.423178196,7.0604424477,-2.3185360432,6.1332321167,5.3563365936,-2.0913259983,7.0188422203,4.6666827202,4.1626596451,8.0214662552,2.1688246727,3.5019094944,-2.1062297821,-2.0428593159,3.083712101,1.3432877064,0.8830078244,3.5260813236,4.6365618706,-0.0158846378,10.2347145081,0.7303216457,3.3696773052,3.4468586445,-1.5692503452,3.9222428799,1.8172826767,2.824805975,0.5157564282,2.3849947453,-0.5698608756,4.8109960556,0.7606216669,2.6213517189,0.1782692373,1.41606915,1.8676862717,4.2561354637,3.3445937634,3.6544868946,3.2303581238,2.9257485867,4.1334195137,1.0838842392,1.7265841961,-3.2526788712,3.0047695637,3.4053030014,1.5493812561,3.6446847916,2.7949163914,4.3006472588,4.430961132,3.1830434799,3.3676006794,4.1446151733,0.6026266813,5.3671236038,-0.3590461016,3.7023553848,3.8764767647,2.31670928,-0.4388997555,6.6785678864,3.8767447472,3.3362989426,1.4555915594,3.8038277626,-1.9186544418,3.3639307022,0.8342701197,2.9947504997,1.8284204006,4.6499090195,1.7647531033,4.6488595009,5.5436191559],"model_output_tokens":[" The"," ","2","6","th"," Bi","ath","lon"," World"," Championships"," were"," held"," in"," R","as","nov",","," Rom","ania","."," The"," event"," took"," place"," from"," February"," ","2","3"," to"," March"," ","5",","," ","2","0","1","3","."," Bi","ath","lon"," is"," a"," winter"," sport"," that"," comb","ines"," cross","-","country"," ski","ing"," and"," rifle"," shooting","."," Compet","itors"," race"," while"," wearing"," cross","-","country"," sk","is"," with"," rif","les"," carried"," over"," their"," shoulders","."," They"," must"," stop"," at"," specific"," points"," along"," the"," course"," to"," shoot"," targets"," with"," their"," rif","les","."," Fail","ure"," to"," hit"," all"," the"," targets"," within"," a"," certain"," time"," limit"," results"," in"," pen","alties",","," such"," as"," additional"," l","aps"," or"," extra"," time"," added"," to"," their"," race",".","<\/s>"]}

{"id":"val-en-18","lang":"EN","model_input":"Is a graphics address redressing table a type of input-output memory management unit?","model_output_text":" A Graphics Address Redirection Table (GART) is not exactly the same as an Input-Output (I\/O) Memory Management Unit (MMU), but they do share some similarities in the sense that they both deal with memory mapping and addressing.\n\nA GART is a data structure used by graphics processing units (GPUs) to translate or map the virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses in video memory. This allows the GPU to access data stored in system memory as if it were located in its own local memory, improving performance and reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the CPU and GPU over the bus.\n\nOn the other hand, an I\/O MMU is a hardware component that manages the memory mapping for I\/O devices. It translates virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses in the I\/O device's memory space, allowing the CPU to access I\/O devices as if they were regular memory. This can help improve system performance and security by hiding the complexities of I\/O addressing from the CPU and providing a more consistent memory model for software.\n\nSo while both GARTs and I\/O MMUs deal with memory mapping and addressing, they serve different purposes in the system.

The Kremlin is surrounded by thick walls and towers, making it a formidable fortress.\n\nDetinets, on the other hand, was the original fortified core of the Moscow Kremlin.

It is a smaller, more compact area within the larger Kremlin complex, which includes the Cathedral Square with its famous cathedrals such as St. Basil's Cathedral and the Archangel Michael

","model_output_text":" It is not possible to identify a single physician as the first to treat patients with cerebral palsy, as the condition was likely not recognized as a distinct entity until much later. Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and movement, often caused by damage to the developing brain before or during birth. The term \"cerebral palsy\" was first used in 1845 by Dr. John Hinton, but it was not until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the condition began to be better understood and diagnosed. Early treatments for cerebral palsy focused on managing symptoms through physical therapy, orthopedic interventions, and the use of braces or other assistive devices.","model_id":"TheBloke\/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF","soft_labels":[{"start":1,"prob":0.3333333333,"end":7},{"start":7,"prob":0.6666666667,"end":19},{"start":19,"prob":0.4444444444,"end":23},{"start":23,"prob":0.5555555556,"end":33},{"start":33,"prob":0.4444444444,"end":50},{"start":50,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":101},{"start":101,"prob":0.1111111111,"end":103},{"start":103,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":131},{"start":131,"prob":0.3333333333,"end":135},{"start":135,"prob":0.4444444444,"end":166},{"start":166,"prob":0.3333333333,"end":183},{"start":183,"prob":0.1111111111,"end":270},{"start":270,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":275},{"start":275,"prob":0.1111111111,"end":327},{"start":327,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":333},{"start":333,"prob":0.1111111111,"end":341},{"start":341,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":367},{"start":367,"prob":0.3333333333,"end":385},{"start":385,"prob":1.0,"end":389},{"start":389,"prob":0.4444444444,"end":393},{"start":393,"prob":1.0,"end":408},{"start":408,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":435},{"start":435,"prob":0.3333333333,"end":439},{"start":439,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":532},{"start":532,"prob":0.1111111111,"end":534},{"start":534,"prob":0.3333333333,"end":539},{"start":539,"prob":0.1111111111,"end":655},{"start":655,"prob":0.2222222222,"end":699}],"hard_labels":[[7,19],[23,33],[385,389],[393,408]],"model_output_logits":[-2.7002789974,0.9769864082,2.9342963696,3.9087815285,-2.5041177273,2.999935627,1.2143745422,4.7846770287,3.558524847,-0.7298821807,6.6004767418,4.9243860245,0.9653230309,3.4193601608,-0.661524415,1.8309388161,3.2452535629,8.7827396393,7.3072319031,0.6827251911,1.2164331675,-0.9880524874,0.4982403517,7.2295355797,4.2136769295,4.3905682564,-0.320625633,3.0257878304,2.3618278503,3.0026674271,1.0175449848,8.5362262726,3.5386986732,5.6749296188,1.9865441322,2.8875567913,5.5323514938,1.732460618,-0.3793379068,-1.0826388597,0.7142509222,4.7814340591,1.3049767017,0.9023189545,-0.3727309108,-0.4768890738,3.9104557037,4.481595993,-0.6209024787,4.8773560524,1.6871118546,5.1853084564,3.3248479366,5.0036702156,6.7803058624,1.3156551123,4.7249212265,1.2719182968,6.2840251923,1.3369998932,4.1367855072,2.9753684998,1.2309809923,2.8787546158,4.3219184875,7.1559257507,1.6197462082,4.6445412636,4.3315167427,4.6228666306,1.965182662,0.4578610659,1.6170051098,1.2322394848,-2.4327764511,-2.1408865452,-0.0592166483,4.4053068161,1.2562980652,2.9802174568,0.0991174877,1.7598444223,2.1206200123,4.1370048523,3.390519619,2.0298657417,6.7596435547,2.8337554932,5.8186430931,20.6853237152,18.1619529724,1.4622895718,1.4991502762,-0.3659896553,-0.1443367898,4.5980501175,-0.123613745,0.2859755754,7.2753190994,4.2040247917,3.8060297966,1.8996245861,2.8913490772,2.1711244583,5.2711029053,10.8857240677,2.4475922585,3.9097936153,1.5730999708,7.1930932999,6.8724155426,6.2483844757,2.2019846439,9.4225273132,3.6410574913,6.3026390076,1.0726928711,5.7951989174,5.4168334007,-1.5993698835,-0.0720326304,5.7311468124,2.8273665905,2.5435535908,0.1455995739,5.3957242966,3.9324262142,1.0643382072,0.7713117599,0.225583896,3.7980518341,7.7781801224,6.4909830093,1.0950938463,2.4413928986,-2.8019304276,1.0779461861,2.5936365128,2.7468614578,-0.1007625759,4.8947339058,3.9959821701,3.8963489532,0.862601161,4.8791284561,7.4877033234,2.2849774361,2.1723051071,1.9823629856,2.3792586327,6.2567362785,5.5592155457,4.3397116661,2.4812972546,1.9767845869,8.5099534988,0.8051887751,4.2667312622,4.779405117,8.1013669968,4.5896806717,0.9580132961,5.3266644478],"model_output_tokens":[" It"," is"," not"," possible"," to"," identify"," a"," single"," physician"," as"," the"," first"," to"," treat"," patients"," with"," cere","br","al"," p","als","y",","," as"," the"," condition"," was"," likely"," not"," recognized"," as"," a"," distinct"," entity"," until"," much"," later","."," C","ere","br","al"," p","als","y"," is"," a"," group"," of"," disorders"," that"," affect"," muscle"," coord","ination"," and"," movement",","," often"," caused"," by"," damage"," to"," the"," developing"," brain"," before"," or"," during"," birth","."," The"," term"," \"","c","ere","br","al"," p","als","y","\""," was"," first"," used"," in"," ","1","8","4","5"," by"," Dr","."," John"," H","inton",","," but"," it"," was"," not"," until"," the"," late"," ","1","9","th"," and"," early"," ","2","0","th"," centuries"," that"," the"," condition"," began"," to"," be"," better"," understood"," and"," diagnosed","."," Early"," treatments"," for"," cere","br","al"," p","als","y"," focused"," on"," managing"," symptoms"," through"," physical"," therapy",","," orth","oped","ic"," inter","ventions",","," and"," the"," use"," of"," br","aces"," or"," other"," assist","ive"," devices",".","<\/s>"]}
