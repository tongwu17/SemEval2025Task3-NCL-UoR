    "1. **Identify hallucinated words or phrases** in the model output based on the question and background knowledge.\n",
    "   - A word or phrase is considered a hallucination if it:\n",
    "     - Contradicts the background knowledge.\n",
    "     - Is unverifiable or fabricated.\n",
    "     - Contains logical inconsistencies.\n",
    "2. **Assign a probability score** to each hallucinated word or phrase according to the following criteria:\n",
    "   - **Probability > 0.7**: Severe factual errors or contradictions.\n",
    "   - **Probability 0.5 - 0.7**: Unverifiable or speculative content.\n",
    "   - **Probability 0.3 - 0.5**: Minor inconsistencies or unverifiable details.\n",
    "   - **Probability 0.1 - 0.3**: Minor inaccuracies or vague ambiguities.\n",
    "   - **Do not label words with probability ≤ 0.1** (i.e., verifiable facts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Instructions**:\n",
    "- Do **not** mark redundant or overly generic words (e.g., \"the\", \"a\", \"and\") as hallucinations unless they introduce factual errors.\n",
    "- Pay special attention to:\n",
    "  - **Numerical data** (e.g., dates, quantities, percentages).\n",
    "  - **Named entities** (e.g., people, organizations, locations).\n",
    "  - **Logical contradictions** (e.g., self-contradictions within the text).\n",
    "- If background knowledge is absent, base your judgment solely on internal consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**:\n",
    "#### Input:\n",

    "- **Model Output**: \"Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922 for his discovery of the photoelectric effect.\"\n",
    "- **Background Knowledge**: \"Einstein won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.\"\n",
